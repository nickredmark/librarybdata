<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:16.520" style="s2">to begin by thanking all of you for</p>

<p begin="00:00:16.520" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">all the support so today we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.939" end="00:00:26.849" style="s2">begin with the questions from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:32.070" style="s2">patreon supporters and I&#39;d like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.849" end="00:00:34.500" style="s2">with the question from Matt gum bleep a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.070" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">trans reporter his question is what do</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">you think the extent of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">phenomenological differences experienced</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">in cognition by biologically modern</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:44.610" style="s2">humans from significantly different</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">historical concepts context for example</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">pre versus post Paleolithic revolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">pre versus post actual age are the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">hypotheses that accentuate the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">differences such as sapir-whorf and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">bicameralism credible so let&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">answer that in Reverse that bicameralism</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">I take is a reference to Julian Jaynes</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:09.890" style="s2">book the origin of consciousness in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">breakdown of the bicameral mind so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.890" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">remember talking to somebody about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">book and they once said to me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:18.710" style="s2">book filled with a hundred really good</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">ideas and a thousand really bad ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.710" end="00:01:26.150" style="s2">so James had the hypothesis that before</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">a certain period of socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.150" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">complexity the two hemispheres were much</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">more distinct in their functionality and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">the left hemisphere experienced the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">right hemisphere as an independent mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">or consciousness that would periodically</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:44.390" style="s2">command or speak to the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">and this was a experience of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.390" end="00:01:52.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting idea he tried to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">marshal some evidence for it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.520" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">ways of rereading ancient texts I find</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">the idea interesting and it does I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">it does line up with some ideas from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">world later work done by it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">what brain patients and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.560" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">however overall I would say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:16.710" style="s2">think the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:19.080" style="s2">for it is that convincing I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.710" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">there&#39;s good reason to believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.080" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">problem-solving we see in in even let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:30.600" style="s2">say let&#39;s talk about the much earlier</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">you know the Paleolithic period the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.600" end="00:02:34.230" style="s2">projectile weapons that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">during the Upper Paleolithic transition</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.230" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">and the calendrical and very</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:39.750" style="s2">sophisticated technology and the trade</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">networks I find it very hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.750" end="00:02:44.459" style="s2">that that kind of sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:46.590" style="s2">cognition was possible without the kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.459" end="00:02:50.180" style="s2">of functionality we see today which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.590" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">pretty continuous and complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.180" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">interaction pretty almost seamless</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:57.600" style="s2">between the right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">hemisphere because of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.600" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">problem-solving that was going on there</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:05.810" style="s2">so generally I would put aside that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:11.370" style="s2">James proposal the sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.810" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">hypothesis is this is the idea that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:16.050" style="s2">language affects our cognition in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">way we think and then and there are of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.050" end="00:03:19.769" style="s2">course there are different there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">different versions of the sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.769" end="00:03:24.260" style="s2">hypothesis there are there from weak to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:27.000" style="s2">very strong the strong version is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">which is sometimes called a form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.000" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">linguistic determinism is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">language you speak really seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">constrains the kind of cognition you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">have and the idea is like famously or</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:42.540" style="s2">infamously because it&#39;s not really true</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways in which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.540" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">factually inaccurate but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">idea that the Inuit people have many</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">different terms for snow and so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">could perceive many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:57.690" style="s2">snow that people who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.410" end="00:04:00.110" style="s2">presumably people in other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.690" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">world can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.110" end="00:04:05.959" style="s2">so I mean Berlin and Kay and others who</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">did tests on that you can get in huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.959" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">variation in the way people cut up the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:14.820" style="s2">color spectrum the in terms of the names</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">they have for colors and so some</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.820" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">cultures of look you know we have like</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">eight basic ones other cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">four right so people cut up the color</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">spectrum with their linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">categories in very different ways but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:27.950" style="s2">that seems to have no impact on their</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.230" style="s2">be on their ability to actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.950" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">perceptually distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.230" end="00:04:34.250" style="s2">different colors different hues</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.990" end="00:04:36.950" style="s2">different shades and think about it this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.250" end="00:04:39.200" style="s2">makes sense you you see many many</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.950" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">different shades of red</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.200" end="00:04:42.530" style="s2">you know something between scarlet and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:43.790" style="s2">chartreuse or whatever the colors are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.530" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have a name for it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.790" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">you&#39;re still capable of perceiving it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">finding it familiar etc so there this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:54.050" style="s2">the strong version of the sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.480" style="s2">hypothesis has been one of the most sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.050" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">of empirically disconfirmed hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:05:02.510" style="s2">in cognitive science now of course there</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:03.650" style="s2">are weaker versions there&#39;s there there</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.510" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">seems to be some evidence for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:10.580" style="s2">that being multilingual as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:13.370" style="s2">armani lingual can have a significant</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.580" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">impact on work your ability to use</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.370" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">executive functions from working memory</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:22.580" style="s2">etc and and that you know that empirical</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:25.970" style="s2">data is still you know controversial but</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.580" end="00:05:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a reasonable position to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.970" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">take with respected sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.260" end="00:05:34.700" style="s2">hypothesis now i suppose i have</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.400" end="00:05:39.650" style="s2">something of a weak sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.700" end="00:05:41.690" style="s2">hypothesis in this way where i think not</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.650" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">so much our linguistic categories but</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.690" end="00:05:46.700" style="s2">what I would call our cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:51.100" style="s2">the fundamental categories that we use</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.700" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">in order to work out our ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">articulate our experience I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:59.420" style="s2">has a significant impact on the way we</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">can formulate problems and try and solve</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.420" end="00:06:07.010" style="s2">problems and I&#39;ve articulated that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:11.240" style="s2">the series now to to to the core of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.010" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">Matt&#39;s question does that would somebody</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.240" end="00:06:16.490" style="s2">living in the pre XV world have had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:18.320" style="s2">phenomenologically different world in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.490" end="00:06:20.180" style="s2">one sense no I don&#39;t think for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.320" end="00:06:22.850" style="s2">reasons I&#39;ve just articulated that their</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.180" end="00:06:27.140" style="s2">perceptual experience would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.850" end="00:06:29.180" style="s2">fundamentally different but of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.140" end="00:06:34.490" style="s2">perceptual experience isn&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.180" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">goes into the phenomenological field the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.490" end="00:06:38.540" style="s2">way you are sizing up situations and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">formulating problems which could be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.540" end="00:06:42.650" style="s2">much affected by</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">your cognitive grammar how you how</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.650" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">you&#39;re basically creating a salience</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">landscape I think is very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:52.820" style="s2">affected by your cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:56.060" style="s2">grammar and in that sense what you find</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.820" end="00:06:59.530" style="s2">salient what you attend to what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:07:03.020" style="s2">problems you formulate what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.530" end="00:07:06.590" style="s2">situations you size up that I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.020" end="00:07:09.320" style="s2">could be different and in that way it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.590" end="00:07:14.060" style="s2">could contribute to a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.320" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">difference and so a question that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.060" end="00:07:19.100" style="s2">emerges our final question before I move</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:22.280" style="s2">on to the next one or questions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.100" end="00:07:25.550" style="s2">implied by Matt&#39;s question is does that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.280" end="00:07:28.430" style="s2">make the phenomenology of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.550" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">that period incommensurable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.430" end="00:07:32.419" style="s2">accessible I know that&#39;s very that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.010" end="00:07:36.440" style="s2">very difficult question it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.419" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">know how to answer it I think of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">there might be some aspects in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:43.430" style="s2">their relevance realization is fitted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">their time and place and so there will</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">be a degree of inaccessibility however I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">do think and this is something I try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:51.110" style="s2">do in the series I think it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:53.780" style="s2">for us to reverse engineer to a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.110" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">significant degree that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.780" end="00:07:59.539" style="s2">conceptual grammar and Tron and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:08:01.760" style="s2">about it in the series and try to make a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.539" end="00:08:03.200" style="s2">worldview viable for us again so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.760" end="00:08:05.630" style="s2">it&#39;s not just something we&#39;re conceiving</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.200" end="00:08:08.330" style="s2">of it&#39;s something that is reshaping our</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.630" end="00:08:09.949" style="s2">phenomenological field and and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.330" end="00:08:12.680" style="s2">I think it&#39;s possible to at least have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.949" end="00:08:14.840" style="s2">significant bridging of horizons between</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.680" end="00:08:17.780" style="s2">our current phenomenological mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.840" end="00:08:20.900" style="s2">those of people in the past so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.780" end="00:08:24.260" style="s2">that tries to kids at least the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.900" end="00:08:29.110" style="s2">beginning of an answer to a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.260" end="00:08:31.400" style="s2">and profound question so the patreon</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.110" end="00:08:32.810" style="s2">supporter Mike Cohen asks the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.400" end="00:08:35.959" style="s2">are you familiar with the work of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.810" end="00:08:37.550" style="s2">Fernando Flores he calls ontology if so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.959" end="00:08:40.430" style="s2">how do you see this work impacting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.550" end="00:08:45.080" style="s2">meaning crisis I am not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.430" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">that work at all I&#39;m sorry and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.080" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">just ignorant so I&#39;m not going to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:51.079" style="s2">any pronouncements on that I&#39;ll move to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:52.700" style="s2">the second question which is are you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.079" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">familiar with the integral work of Ken</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.700" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">Wilber if so do you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">this offering anyways forth for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:01.640" style="s2">meeting crisis I am somewhat familiar I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">do not claim any kind of significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.640" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">expertise in with Ken Wilbur&#39;s work I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:08.600" style="s2">also I&#39;m familiar with some people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">have come out of the integral movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.600" end="00:09:12.290" style="s2">and some sets of practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.190" end="00:09:16.540" style="s2">associated with the integral movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.290" end="00:09:21.020" style="s2">such as circling in so far as I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.540" end="00:09:23.420" style="s2">seen some of the practices I think those</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.020" end="00:09:26.900" style="s2">psycho technologies those practices like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.420" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">the circling practice I think will help</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.900" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">to play a very significant role in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:36.260" style="s2">helping us reconfigure something</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:39.110" style="s2">analogous to die or the old Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.260" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">platonic dialectic to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.110" end="00:09:44.870" style="s2">something like a meta psychology that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:46.940" style="s2">can collectively share so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.870" end="00:09:49.190" style="s2">get a much much more authentic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.940" end="00:09:53.000" style="s2">going between us and I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.190" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">this is going to be upon here an</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.000" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">integral part of responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:09:59.960" style="s2">meeting crisis in that I think we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:02.180" style="s2">going to need these collective psychic</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.960" end="00:10:05.500" style="s2">technologies and the intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.180" end="00:10:08.960" style="s2">distributed cognition in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.500" end="00:10:10.820" style="s2">reshape and reorganize our ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.960" end="00:10:13.370" style="s2">practices for responding to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.820" end="00:10:17.180" style="s2">crisis so insofar as I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.370" end="00:10:19.250" style="s2">connection I can see that work I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.180" end="00:10:23.330" style="s2">like to point out though I just had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.250" end="00:10:25.190" style="s2">there a wonderful discussion with dense</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.330" end="00:10:27.530" style="s2">talk the guy who invented circling and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.190" end="00:10:29.840" style="s2">although he was associated with interval</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.530" end="00:10:31.370" style="s2">a guy made it very clear to me in a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.840" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">that I found very insightful and helpful</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.370" end="00:10:37.330" style="s2">that his original and ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">inspiration for the practice of circling</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.330" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">is Heidegger and not Ken Wilber and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:46.550" style="s2">found that very very revealing and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:49.790" style="s2">actually helped me make much better</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.550" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">sense of the practice and then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.790" end="00:10:55.310" style="s2">going on in that and I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:56.630" style="s2">about a hunter in the series we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.310" end="00:11:00.590" style="s2">filming some of those episodes right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.630" end="00:11:03.620" style="s2">and so I think I&#39;ll try and make some</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.590" end="00:11:06.740" style="s2">connections there at that time I have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.620" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">more general familiarity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.740" end="00:11:11.180" style="s2">in depth with transpersonal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:15.500" style="s2">in general with that&#39;s the category to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.180" end="00:11:17.060" style="s2">which Wilbur is often put I know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.500" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">work of Michael Washburn which I found</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.060" end="00:11:21.320" style="s2">much more developmental and dynamic his</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.320" end="00:11:28.580" style="s2">found really useful Jurgen Ferrara&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.280" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">think is a really pivotal book and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">think though and that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:43.690" style="s2">participatory knowing and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:45.830" style="s2">fur is doing on that or gave her air</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.690" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">provisioning transpersonal psychology</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.830" end="00:11:49.790" style="s2">and another anthology called the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:51.890" style="s2">participatory term I think that as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.790" end="00:11:54.050" style="s2">tried to argue in the series it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.890" end="00:11:57.740" style="s2">to be important to responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.050" end="00:11:59.990" style="s2">meeting crisis right so the next</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.740" end="00:12:02.540" style="s2">question from the patreon supporter des</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.990" end="00:12:04.730" style="s2">are discovering meaning for ourselves in</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s a very good question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.320" end="00:12:17.980" style="s2">hesitant to answer it because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:21.950" style="s2">want to treat work as a homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.980" end="00:12:23.810" style="s2">category there&#39;s many different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.950" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">work some of it of course very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.810" end="00:12:28.820" style="s2">satisfying other other forms of work you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:32.450" style="s2">know drudgery and bordering on</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.820" end="00:12:35.180" style="s2">exploitation and so I&#39;m very hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.450" end="00:12:37.310" style="s2">pronounce as a whole I&#39;ll try and but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.180" end="00:12:39.050" style="s2">will never let&#39;s try and undertake my</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.310" end="00:12:41.510" style="s2">responsibilities gave at least provides</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.050" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">some response to an important question</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.510" end="00:12:51.890" style="s2">and so what I would want to say there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:54.430" style="s2">the degree to which it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.890" end="00:12:57.890" style="s2">unquestionable that work has a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.430" end="00:13:01.070" style="s2">significant impact on our identity on</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.890" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">our cognitive practices and habits and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.070" end="00:13:08.690" style="s2">on a communicative practices and habits</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:10.340" style="s2">so it&#39;s quite possible therefore that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.690" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">work could have a very dilatory as</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.340" end="00:13:16.310" style="s2">effect on the kinds of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:19.860" style="s2">practices you would need to engage in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.310" end="00:13:22.829" style="s2">order to start to respond</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.860" end="00:13:26.040" style="s2">individually and perhaps collectively to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.829" end="00:13:28.380" style="s2">the meeting crisis one way for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.040" end="00:13:30.930" style="s2">in which that may more broadly apply is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.380" end="00:13:34.940" style="s2">something I talked about in the series</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.930" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">the degree to which we&#39;re involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.940" end="00:13:41.430" style="s2">system I guess for want of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:45.810" style="s2">a capitalist system we can be subject to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.430" end="00:13:47.850" style="s2">a a series of constraints that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.810" end="00:13:50.459" style="s2">reinforced at work that who had</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.850" end="00:13:52.470" style="s2">seriously trap us into confusing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.459" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">having mode and the being mode I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.470" end="00:13:57.149" style="s2">arguing that this is a necessity of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">work as I said I&#39;m very reticent about</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.149" end="00:14:01.589" style="s2">pronouncing on a very heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">category in any comprehensive way but</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.589" end="00:14:08.310" style="s2">there are certain shared patterns for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">lot of people within the the the market</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.310" end="00:14:12.899" style="s2">economy that we work in that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:16.470" style="s2">commodify things and tend to lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.899" end="00:14:18.180" style="s2">danger of sort of trapping people in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.470" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">modal confusion and this of course was</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.180" end="00:14:25.589" style="s2">one of Fromm&#39;s persistent concerns and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:32.550" style="s2">it&#39;s I could see that as being</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.589" end="00:14:37.110" style="s2">exacerbated by people&#39;s work now on the</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.169" end="00:17:50.139" style="s2">as I&#39;ve talked about and so I think</p>

<p begin="00:17:50.139" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">somebody who can use a tool in that way</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.139" end="00:17:59.239" style="s2">they can sort of see through it and be</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:02.389" style="s2">through it and identify with it and</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.210" end="00:18:17.059" style="s2">significant fashion and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.009" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">think it stands to reason on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.059" end="00:18:22.070" style="s2">of that argument that their salience</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:25.909" style="s2">landscape would be significantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.070" end="00:18:28.489" style="s2">different given the degree to which they</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.909" end="00:18:32.239" style="s2">can both end well and internalize the</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.239" end="00:18:37.399" style="s2">was asked to talk again within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.789" end="00:18:39.710" style="s2">business world on issues around people</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.399" end="00:18:41.570" style="s2">adopting new technologies I pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.710" end="00:18:43.489" style="s2">that one of the problems that many of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.570" end="00:18:46.220" style="s2">the corporations are facing and many of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.489" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">the companies are facing is that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.220" end="00:18:50.419" style="s2">are often only paying attention to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:52.340" style="s2">utilitarian way of framing the new</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.419" end="00:18:53.989" style="s2">technology showing people what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.340" end="00:18:55.820" style="s2">technology can do and how it can improve</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.989" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">performance and improve productive</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.820" end="00:19:01.129" style="s2">productivity in blah blah blah and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:04.059" style="s2">leaves out the whole fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.129" end="00:19:07.850" style="s2">naturally born cyborgs that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.059" end="00:19:09.710" style="s2">seek to indwell technology and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.850" end="00:19:12.499" style="s2">internalize it and therefore their</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.710" end="00:19:14.419" style="s2">identity is importantly existentially at</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.499" end="00:19:17.059" style="s2">risk when they come into a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.419" end="00:19:20.029" style="s2">substantial technology and that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.059" end="00:19:22.249" style="s2">be taken into account when you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.029" end="00:19:25.009" style="s2">to introduce new and new technologies</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.249" end="00:19:28.399" style="s2">and this is basically an idea that goes</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.009" end="00:19:31.179" style="s2">back or at least can be made coherent</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.399" end="00:19:34.789" style="s2">with some of Heidegger&#39;s arguments about</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.179" end="00:19:36.799" style="s2">how technology tends to create a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.789" end="00:19:40.239" style="s2">particular ontology in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.799" end="00:19:40.239" style="s2">of dwelling in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.419" end="00:19:50.739" style="s2">so the next is from an anonymous patron</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.339" end="00:19:52.239" style="s2">subscriber when you talk about providing</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.229" end="00:20:00.909" style="s2">ones I sort of picture this as just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.599" end="00:20:02.499" style="s2">tool shed for them to draw from whenever</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.909" end="00:20:05.379" style="s2">they want to solve some problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.499" end="00:20:07.149" style="s2">meditation helps relax and send off</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.379" end="00:20:08.769" style="s2">positive vibes after a hard day at work</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.149" end="00:20:10.209" style="s2">or the view from above would help me</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.769" end="00:20:14.289" style="s2">plan for the future and therefore making</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.969" end="00:20:20.379" style="s2">needed for them to pattern themselves on</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.309" end="00:20:28.389" style="s2">more to it than the tool shed model and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.289" end="00:20:29.950" style="s2">I try to convey this and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.389" end="00:20:31.659" style="s2">talk about this again later in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.950" end="00:20:36.219" style="s2">series with this notion of an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.659" end="00:20:37.570" style="s2">practices and so it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.219" end="00:20:39.940" style="s2">think about these various psycho</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.570" end="00:20:43.389" style="s2">technologies all of these psycho</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.559" end="00:20:54.309" style="s2">machinery and so in that sense as always</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.049" end="00:20:57.159" style="s2">that very machinery that&#39;s making us</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.309" end="00:21:01.719" style="s2">adaptive and improving our adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.159" end="00:21:03.190" style="s2">also comes with inevitable cost and a</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.190" end="00:21:18.459" style="s2">things the top-down strategy can do is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.259" end="00:21:21.820" style="s2">to provide people with reliable vetting</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.130" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">don&#39;t fall into certain biases like</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:06.400" style="s2">confirmation bias when you&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:09.310" style="s2">evidence for your inferential practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.400" end="00:22:11.800" style="s2">etc and what it tends to do is it tends</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.310" end="00:22:12.940" style="s2">to shut off that more intuitive aspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.800" end="00:22:15.160" style="s2">of your cognition so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.940" end="00:22:18.490" style="s2">constantly leaping to conclusions in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.160" end="00:22:20.650" style="s2">that sense it really improves the way in</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.490" end="00:22:23.140" style="s2">which people use inference and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.650" end="00:22:27.060" style="s2">to alter their beliefs but it has the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.140" end="00:22:31.720" style="s2">cost precisely of really you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.060" end="00:22:34.270" style="s2">constraining and and and restricting the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.720" end="00:22:40.140" style="s2">intuitive insight machinery and so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.270" end="00:22:40.140" style="s2">can have a opposite and complimentary</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:44.890" style="s2">cycle of technology of mindfulness which</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.820" end="00:22:48.100" style="s2">basically tries to shut down the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.890" end="00:22:50.650" style="s2">inferential processing the the attempts</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:52.650" style="s2">to fix you know an assign belief and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.650" end="00:22:55.780" style="s2">tries to open up the insight and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.650" end="00:22:57.640" style="s2">intuitive machinery and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.780" end="00:23:00.790" style="s2">is very beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.640" end="00:23:04.030" style="s2">of course reporting insight for allowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.790" end="00:23:06.460" style="s2">you to tap into you know the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.030" end="00:23:08.560" style="s2">processing implicit learning but it also</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.460" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">carries with it a cost</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.560" end="00:23:14.200" style="s2">I don&#39;t argue for and in in my you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:16.180" style="s2">in my academic work my publications I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.200" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">think the idea that mindfulness is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.180" end="00:23:21.040" style="s2">universal panacea for all aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:23.410" style="s2">self-deception I think that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.040" end="00:23:27.580" style="s2">empirically false and so mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.410" end="00:23:30.430" style="s2">also blinds us in certain ways to things</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.580" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">that need our inferential processing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.430" end="00:23:35.680" style="s2">order to be appropriately addressed and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:40.060" style="s2">so what we need right is we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.680" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">practicing the two of these together and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.060" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">learning how to optimize the balance</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:46.300" style="s2">between them and of course while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">doing all of that here&#39;s a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.300" end="00:23:51.400" style="s2">both of these these tend to both be very</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:54.910" style="s2">sort of you know sitted cerebral sedate</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.400" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">practices and they leave off the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.910" end="00:23:59.950" style="s2">important role of movement which is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.690" style="s2">very powerful way of accessing our</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.690" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">so you should have a movement so I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">technology coordinated with these two</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">more cerebral Psycho technologies I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:10.580" style="s2">trying to give you an example of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">this talk pounds</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.580" end="00:24:17.140" style="s2">strategy looks like it looks about how</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:19.490" style="s2">to coordinate and create a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.140" end="00:24:21.080" style="s2">self-organizing ecology of practices in</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.490" end="00:24:22.490" style="s2">which you get you know checks and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.080" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">balances and mutual constraints between</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.490" end="00:24:27.470" style="s2">the various psycho technologies also</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">part of this top-down strategy and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.470" end="00:24:32.899" style="s2">is something that came out of a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:34.190" style="s2">excellent discussed Syria a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.899" end="00:24:35.990" style="s2">discussions especially the second one I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.190" end="00:24:38.919" style="s2">had with Jordan Hall this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.990" end="00:24:41.419" style="s2">sort of a meta psycho technology a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.919" end="00:24:47.950" style="s2">psycho technology for how to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.419" end="00:24:49.940" style="s2">and coordinate and an engineer and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.950" end="00:24:52.850" style="s2">integrate in the way I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.940" end="00:24:54.620" style="s2">describing psycho technology we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.850" end="00:24:58.070" style="s2">you know this meta psycho technology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.620" end="00:25:00.529" style="s2">I&#39;m very interested in what this might</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.070" end="00:25:02.210" style="s2">look like I think it&#39;s good it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.529" end="00:25:04.010" style="s2">need to be sort of something that we do</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.210" end="00:25:06.230" style="s2">collectively accessing a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.010" end="00:25:09.350" style="s2">cognition I think it being something</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.230" end="00:25:12.350" style="s2">very analogous to socratic and Linkous</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.350" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">and platonic dialectic and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.350" end="00:25:15.980" style="s2">things I&#39;m working on right now is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.850" end="00:25:17.630" style="s2">try and recover what that was as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.980" end="00:25:19.250" style="s2">practice there&#39;s some just excellent</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.630" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">work being done on that right now and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.250" end="00:25:24.169" style="s2">then to put that into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">current practices like circling</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.169" end="00:25:31.399" style="s2">authentic relating that are also trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2">to get back to a way of accessing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.399" end="00:25:35.899" style="s2">distributed cognition putting it into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.350" end="00:25:41.299" style="s2">collective flow state optimizing it so</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.899" end="00:25:44.090" style="s2">that we can get a place in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.299" end="00:25:46.039" style="s2">deeply discuss I sorry that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.090" end="00:25:47.000" style="s2">trivial I&#39;m really trying to emphasize I</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.039" end="00:25:49.159" style="s2">mean there&#39;s going to be much more about</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.000" end="00:25:52.039" style="s2">it say about this but we&#39;ve which we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.159" end="00:25:54.830" style="s2">deeply discuss both the theory and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.039" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">practice of psycho technologies and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.830" end="00:26:02.120" style="s2">this collective way create models and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:04.130" style="s2">templates for how various ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.120" end="00:26:05.419" style="s2">practices can be coordinated together so</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.130" end="00:26:08.289" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would answer the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.419" end="00:26:11.570" style="s2">questionable how the top-down strategy</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.289" end="00:26:13.880" style="s2">looks like something more than just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.570" end="00:26:16.580" style="s2">toolbox that top-down strategy has to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.880" end="00:26:17.899" style="s2">really informed by some good science and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.580" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">I think it also has to be really</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.899" end="00:26:22.220" style="s2">informed by a you know a general thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:25.659" style="s2">about you know understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.220" end="00:26:25.659" style="s2">responding to the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.010" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">so we have another I want to answer I</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.500" end="00:26:39.110" style="s2">want to answer Daniel starlings question</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:41.270" style="s2">first of all Daniel great great to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.110" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">a question from you it was such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.270" end="00:26:45.890" style="s2">pleasure meeting your wife and daughter</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:49.670" style="s2">in that on that beach in San Diego I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.890" end="00:26:52.130" style="s2">so sorry that I remembered and said she</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.670" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">was from that your sister all right that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.130" end="00:26:56.540" style="s2">was some sort of weird Freudian thing I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">might haven&#39;t been been projected on to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.540" end="00:27:02.180" style="s2">you and I I&#39;m sorry about that but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:04.190" style="s2">really appreciated your support and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.180" end="00:27:06.890" style="s2">was such a pleasure to to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.190" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">you my email and to talk to her to meet</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.890" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">your daughter I want to take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:16.820" style="s2">your question so Daniel who is also a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:18.650" style="s2">patreon supporter said how could your</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.820" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">theory of relevance realization be</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.650" end="00:27:23.060" style="s2">falsified such that it meets populist</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:24.950" style="s2">criteria of demarcation so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.060" end="00:27:27.250" style="s2">that&#39;s a very difficult question to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.950" end="00:27:31.940" style="s2">answer it&#39;s a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.250" end="00:27:34.400" style="s2">one of the problems I would have with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.940" end="00:27:37.550" style="s2">and I am and so I wanna go carefully</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.400" end="00:27:40.850" style="s2">here is I&#39;m sort of generally reject</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.550" end="00:27:42.680" style="s2">poppers notion of falsification I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.850" end="00:27:45.830" style="s2">of the work that was done by doing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.680" end="00:27:48.470" style="s2">Quine all kinds of issues about how you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.830" end="00:27:50.540" style="s2">contribute any proposition into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.470" end="00:27:52.040" style="s2">falsifiable proposition by just adding a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.540" end="00:27:54.650" style="s2">conjunction you know do it adding a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.040" end="00:27:57.740" style="s2">conjunction there&#39;s so I think in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.650" end="00:27:59.450" style="s2">concordance with many I think a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.740" end="00:28:03.340" style="s2">consensus in the philosophy of science a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.450" end="00:28:06.370" style="s2">falsification ISM the idea that science</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.340" end="00:28:10.270" style="s2">progresses by falsifying hypotheses I</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.370" end="00:28:14.390" style="s2">think is something I&#39;d want to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.270" end="00:28:18.910" style="s2">so we next move to another a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.390" end="00:28:22.910" style="s2">problem in that you know the argument</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.910" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">the argument for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.910" end="00:28:26.300" style="s2">is supposed to be an argument pointing</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:29.150" style="s2">towards sort of constitutive necessity</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.300" end="00:28:32.510" style="s2">things that the system would have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.150" end="00:28:35.399" style="s2">have and so in there&#39;s an aspect in</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.510" end="00:28:37.619" style="s2">which the prob the the situation the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.399" end="00:28:39.629" style="s2">the notion of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.619" end="00:28:41.759" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be disconfirmed that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.629" end="00:28:45.089" style="s2">couldn&#39;t sort of pile up empirical</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.759" end="00:28:46.469" style="s2">evidence against it because because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.089" end="00:28:49.049" style="s2">some of the transcendental argument the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.469" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">very ability to pile up the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.049" end="00:28:52.349" style="s2">going to presuppose relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:54.179" style="s2">realization machinery you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.349" end="00:28:58.289" style="s2">get into a bit of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.179" end="00:29:00.539" style="s2">self-defeating position because if like</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.289" end="00:29:03.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which if cognition is</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:35.190" style="s2">got a question from Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.900" end="00:32:37.080" style="s2">Oh noir patreon the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.190" end="00:32:41.130" style="s2">would you describe your personal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.080" end="00:32:42.780" style="s2">purpose in one sentence so the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.130" end="00:32:44.370" style="s2">cheekiest thing I could do is my meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.780" end="00:32:45.510" style="s2">or purpose is to respond to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.370" end="00:32:48.840" style="s2">crisis and there we go that was done</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.510" end="00:32:51.060" style="s2">that was easy and that would make me</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.060" end="00:32:58.140" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a deeper truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:33:02.580" style="s2">in that for me trying to really</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.140" end="00:33:07.529" style="s2">understand what meaning cultivation is</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.049" end="00:33:13.529" style="s2">pretentious and I don&#39;t want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.429" end="00:33:15.470" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m trying to convey</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.470" end="00:33:21.059" style="s2">helpful contribution to the reduction in</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.169" end="00:33:37.860" style="s2">that&#39;s my meaning that&#39;s my meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.230" end="00:33:40.200" style="s2">another patreon supporter been BR asked</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.860" end="00:33:41.940" style="s2">do you have any relatively quick natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.200" end="00:33:44.220" style="s2">hacks to make entering the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.940" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">easier natural as opposed to</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:50.490" style="s2">pharmacologically and also something</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.899" end="00:34:08.220" style="s2">means I don&#39;t think there&#39;s sort of a</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.859" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">happen and for to maintain the flow</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.139" end="00:34:21.540" style="s2">state is right there has to be an</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:24.450" style="s2">ongoing increase in the challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.540" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">demands facing you or else your capacity</p>

<p begin="00:34:28.919" end="00:34:33.570" style="s2">then you will fall out of the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:35.129" style="s2">and begin to move into boredom one thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.570" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">I could recommend you could start taking</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.129" end="00:34:41.669" style="s2">up that will very quickly start to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:45.030" style="s2">you into the flow state is to take up a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.669" end="00:34:48.030" style="s2">a challenging movement practice for for</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.030" end="00:34:51.149" style="s2">example for me in Tai Chi Chuan does</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.030" end="00:34:53.970" style="s2">that precisely I mean a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.149" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">Taoist practices and you don&#39;t you I</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.970" end="00:34:58.290" style="s2">mean you can practice them for years and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">they they are inexhaustible in their</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.290" end="00:35:03.960" style="s2">capacity to teach you and transform you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:05.369" style="s2">but they also start to rapidly get you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.960" end="00:35:07.740" style="s2">into the flow state because these</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.369" end="00:35:10.080" style="s2">practices I mean Taoism is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.740" end="00:35:11.730" style="s2">religion of flow induction I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.080" end="00:35:14.490" style="s2">more than that but it&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.730" end="00:35:16.200" style="s2">the core of it so finding a movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.490" end="00:35:18.470" style="s2">practice and why do I emphasize move</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.200" end="00:35:20.849" style="s2">practices because they tend to give us</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.470" end="00:35:23.339" style="s2">they&#39;re much more likely to give us that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.849" end="00:35:25.800" style="s2">clear feedback then that we need we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.339" end="00:35:28.589" style="s2">tend to make them challenging just by</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.800" end="00:35:31.349" style="s2">rearranging the fireman or putting</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.589" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">demands on our balance and movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.349" end="00:35:36.570" style="s2">practices get the cerebellum to kick in</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.200" end="00:35:39.000" style="s2">and having the cerebellum kick in is</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.570" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">really important for helping to increase</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.000" end="00:35:43.829" style="s2">the chances that you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">into the flow state so I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.829" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">considering something like that as a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">of getting at least an initial practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:54.810" style="s2">that can initially get you into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">State what you&#39;ll find though is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.810" end="00:35:58.349" style="s2">the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:36:00.990" style="s2">it has this wonderful dialogue right as</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.349" end="00:36:03.210" style="s2">you&#39;re doing as the as the practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.990" end="00:36:05.490" style="s2">engenders the flow state the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.210" end="00:36:07.589" style="s2">starts to take you more deeply into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.490" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">practice you start to see things in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.589" end="00:36:11.700" style="s2">practice and then that takes you in</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.490" end="00:36:33.810" style="s2">question do you have any thoughts on how</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.380" end="00:36:35.730" style="s2">our transition from longer form linear</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.810" end="00:36:37.619" style="s2">narratives to more choppy and fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.730" end="00:36:39.690" style="s2">at mean culture impacts meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.619" end="00:36:42.569" style="s2">and a sense of personal identity</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.690" end="00:36:44.579" style="s2">continuity yeah I do and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.569" end="00:36:47.730" style="s2">that I&#39;m currently working with on Chris</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.730" end="00:36:54.930" style="s2">based on some really interesting work</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:57.710" style="s2">done by Han and he&#39;s got a whole series</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.930" end="00:37:01.290" style="s2">of books dealing with this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.710" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">especially I would recommend this but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.290" end="00:37:06.089" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s his work isn&#39;t that bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:07.589" style="s2">it&#39;s not like reading corn but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.089" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">a book you take to the beach but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.589" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">sense of time is a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">important book so he argues that our</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.760" end="00:37:18.060" style="s2">experience of time is is being</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:21.300" style="s2">fundamentally changed a time is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.060" end="00:37:23.819" style="s2">more sort of atomized and buzzing rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.300" end="00:37:25.859" style="s2">than you know flowing in a cascading</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.819" end="00:37:27.540" style="s2">manner for us and that goes back again</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.859" end="00:37:28.750" style="s2">to that phenomenological difference</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.540" end="00:37:31.869" style="s2">thing we were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.750" end="00:37:33.970" style="s2">right so let me give one really</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.869" end="00:37:37.420" style="s2">interesting way in which you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.970" end="00:37:38.890" style="s2">this let&#39;s let&#39;s take it as a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.420" end="00:37:43.420" style="s2">because we have evidence for this that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.890" end="00:37:45.580" style="s2">music was one of the was a central</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.420" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">psycho technology invented in the upper</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.580" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">paleolithic transition that music is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:52.630" style="s2">psycho technology that plays with your</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:55.320" style="s2">salience landscape and your insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.630" end="00:37:59.590" style="s2">machinery and your flow machinery right</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.320" end="00:38:01.540" style="s2">powerfully music is a universal so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.590" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">say that music is like really central</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.540" end="00:38:06.760" style="s2">like this notice one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">things and I want to apologize I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.760" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">remember the name of the person the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.990" style="s2">theorist is doing this right now I</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">apologize</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.990" end="00:38:19.180" style="s2">anyways the argument this this theorist</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:25.090" style="s2">is making is talking about the death of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:28.840" style="s2">melody that in our music because of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.090" end="00:38:32.260" style="s2">proliferation of streaming and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.840" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">and you know all of this and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.260" end="00:38:36.580" style="s2">therefore the increased competitiveness</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.140" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and think about how</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.580" end="00:38:41.020" style="s2">this is like a kind of bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.140" end="00:38:44.290" style="s2">right the salience of the music is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.020" end="00:38:48.339" style="s2">becoming right more and more prominent</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.290" end="00:38:50.440" style="s2">at the expense of any of any complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.339" end="00:38:52.869" style="s2">and cognitive and perceptual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:55.450" style="s2">processing of the music so we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.869" end="00:38:57.160" style="s2">music in which right we&#39;re getting more</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.450" end="00:39:00.130" style="s2">and more just hooks being linked</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.160" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">together more and more rhythm and melody</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.130" end="00:39:06.130" style="s2">which is often contributed contributes</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:09.220" style="s2">to a narrative sense to the music is</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:11.619" style="s2">being significantly undermined and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.220" end="00:39:13.900" style="s2">like if you listen to some current music</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.619" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">a lot of it a popular music of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.900" end="00:39:18.310" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about right it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">much hook there&#39;s very little melodic</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.310" end="00:39:23.770" style="s2">change right</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:26.290" style="s2">very rhythm heavy very repetitious this</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.770" end="00:39:28.540" style="s2">is often accompanied by a significant</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.290" end="00:39:31.060" style="s2">lyrical impoverishment so there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.540" end="00:39:33.640" style="s2">that much sense of a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.060" end="00:39:36.430" style="s2">development within the lyrics and so all</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.640" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">of this is I&#39;m trying to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.430" end="00:39:41.370" style="s2">concrete way in which our experience of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.580" style="s2">time as being atomized</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.370" end="00:39:47.220" style="s2">because when we engage in music we get</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:48.990" style="s2">into a participatory way of knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.220" end="00:39:51.420" style="s2">we are extended development in</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.990" end="00:39:53.490" style="s2">developing cells through time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.420" end="00:39:55.560" style="s2">what music is that&#39;s what it triggers</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.490" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of identity it involves</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.560" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2">and the way in which that is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:03.030" style="s2">connectedness to the environment and as</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.950" end="00:40:05.220" style="s2">we are removing the the melody and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.030" end="00:40:08.070" style="s2">complex cognitive processing and getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.220" end="00:40:11.640" style="s2">caught up in in the salience we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.070" end="00:40:14.580" style="s2">tending to a demise that time and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.640" end="00:40:16.950" style="s2">sense of identity in in in very</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.580" end="00:40:18.840" style="s2">important ways and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.950" end="00:40:22.190" style="s2">believe anybody&#39;s done an empirical work</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.840" end="00:40:24.540" style="s2">on this it&#39;d be very interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.190" end="00:40:26.190" style="s2">interesting in an epistemic sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.540" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">probable not interesting in a moral</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.190" end="00:40:32.570" style="s2">sense of course the impact that this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:34.890" style="s2">having on people&#39;s cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.570" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">there and there and there and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.890" end="00:40:38.370" style="s2">their sense of narrative identity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:40.650" style="s2">which is a mess of course with their</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.370" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">sense of modal identity the agent having</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.650" end="00:40:45.570" style="s2">a relationship I would predict that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:48.780" style="s2">would see a significant impact on people</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.570" end="00:40:51.450" style="s2">who had only been exposed to this kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.780" end="00:40:53.460" style="s2">of non melodic music but that of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.450" end="00:40:56.100" style="s2">is an open empirical question so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.460" end="00:41:00.780" style="s2">I have answered your question in an</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.100" end="00:41:03.030" style="s2">interesting fashion so one final</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.780" end="00:41:04.650" style="s2">question from a patreon supporter</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.030" end="00:41:06.450" style="s2">Anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.650" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">you mentioned that you struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.450" end="00:41:09.720" style="s2">social anxiety disorder this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2">something I&#39;ve also struggled with as</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.720" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2">well I just want to pause here and say</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:23.700" style="s2">like I just I get this I understand this</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.220" end="00:41:26.310" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you you don&#39;t know me but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.700" end="00:41:30.570" style="s2">think it&#39;s important just to say here</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.310" end="00:41:36.180" style="s2">how much of an impact on a person&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.570" end="00:41:38.780" style="s2">this has and so I I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.180" end="00:41:41.580" style="s2">something trivial but I I sympathize um</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.780" end="00:41:45.120" style="s2">very clearly about what you&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.580" end="00:41:46.950" style="s2">and I hope you are finding some</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.120" end="00:41:50.040" style="s2">successful interventions I&#39;ll return to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.950" end="00:41:52.710" style="s2">continue to the questions severely</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.040" end="00:41:55.460" style="s2">impacting my academic career yeah I get</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.710" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">that because academia is already</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.460" end="00:42:03.349" style="s2">a terrifically paradoxical place in</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:06.440" style="s2">which you are put into competition very</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.349" end="00:42:08.270" style="s2">competitive thing with strangers yet it</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.440" end="00:42:10.609" style="s2">often requires a kind of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.270" end="00:42:13.040" style="s2">intimacy you have to be engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.609" end="00:42:16.070" style="s2">discussion and debate yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.040" end="00:42:17.720" style="s2">challenging I totally get that okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.070" end="00:42:20.260" style="s2">was wondering how you suggest handling</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.720" end="00:42:23.180" style="s2">it outside of the usual Lutz CBT</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.260" end="00:42:26.660" style="s2">medication how this work could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.180" end="00:42:34.940" style="s2">relevant to those suffering from social</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.660" end="00:42:38.660" style="s2">anxiety disorder so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.940" end="00:42:41.510" style="s2">that helped me precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.660" end="00:42:43.070" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just CBT or medication and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.510" end="00:42:46.580" style="s2">are already saying you know you those</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.070" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">definitely need to be pursued and was</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.580" end="00:42:52.670" style="s2">was these movement practices that I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">talking about and I&#39;ve also seen how</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.670" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">this is helpful when you&#39;re going into</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:59.420" style="s2">things like the these collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.770" style="s2">dialogue practices so when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.420" end="00:43:03.230" style="s2">move when when you get good at a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.770" end="00:43:05.990" style="s2">movement practice and you get you get an</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.230" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">increased self-awareness and of being at</p>

<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:14.869" style="s2">least and I don&#39;t so please understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.490" end="00:43:17.030" style="s2">the kind of advice I&#39;m giving you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.869" end="00:43:19.220" style="s2">giving you personal advice I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:43:19.220" end="00:43:24.020" style="s2">but when you have this increased</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.310" end="00:43:27.230" style="s2">self-awareness that of course can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.020" end="00:43:29.869" style="s2">combined with meditative techniques CBT</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.589" end="00:43:48.710" style="s2">was not dependent on the social</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.770" end="00:43:51.830" style="s2">reinforcement I was gay I was getting in</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.520" end="00:44:26.900" style="s2">also as you get into your body and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:30.170" style="s2">activate that participatory knowing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.900" end="00:44:32.540" style="s2">tend to get access to other ways in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.170" end="00:44:33.830" style="s2">which least that&#39;s is what i found i</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.540" end="00:44:37.250" style="s2">want to keep qualifying it that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.830" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">other ways of connecting to people that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.250" end="00:44:42.890" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to be as quite as cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:45.560" style="s2">penetrable by the anxiety machinery and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.890" end="00:44:47.960" style="s2">so i am able to sort of sync up and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.560" end="00:44:50.840" style="s2">connect to people in a way that isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.960" end="00:44:55.580" style="s2">directly attacked by the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.840" end="00:44:57.290" style="s2">machinery so that for me has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.580" end="00:44:59.630" style="s2">particularly helpful for sort of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.290" end="00:45:01.130" style="s2">three reasons those practices the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.630" end="00:45:02.990" style="s2">movement minding breakfast has helped me</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.130" end="00:45:05.960" style="s2">carry mindfulness into moving around in</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.990" end="00:45:07.460" style="s2">the world and help to increase the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.960" end="00:45:10.100" style="s2">the effectiveness of the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.460" end="00:45:12.410" style="s2">interventions being grounded in and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.100" end="00:45:14.660" style="s2">being present through my body right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.410" end="00:45:19.130" style="s2">gives me a counterbalance that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.660" end="00:45:24.110" style="s2">sense of you know disconnect and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.130" end="00:45:25.610" style="s2">know being in no no not being properly</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.110" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">present to others or people being</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.610" end="00:45:30.140" style="s2">inappropriately present to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">as I said thirdly by accessing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.140" end="00:45:35.540" style="s2">participatory knowing I found that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:37.250" style="s2">gave me another way of communing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.540" end="00:45:39.560" style="s2">people and connecting to people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.250" end="00:45:42.980" style="s2">wasn&#39;t as cognitively penetrable by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.560" end="00:45:49.300" style="s2">anxiety and that also helps help has</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.980" end="00:45:53.000" style="s2">helped me as a counterbalance alright so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.300" end="00:45:55.310" style="s2">so we&#39;re switching to some live</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.000" end="00:45:58.360" style="s2">questions oh wait we have another</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.360" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">would it be possible for you to create</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.680" end="00:46:04.250" style="s2">some sort of resource or conglomeration</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:07.460" style="s2">of your etymological points that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.250" end="00:46:09.740" style="s2">think are important yes I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.460" end="00:46:12.710" style="s2">going to try and do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.740" end="00:46:14.930" style="s2">I&#39;ve also noted in episodes and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.710" end="00:46:16.550" style="s2">commentary where I have sometimes made</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.930" end="00:46:20.210" style="s2">an etymological error and I&#39;ve gone back</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.550" end="00:46:23.089" style="s2">and tried to correct it or so I yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.210" end="00:46:24.580" style="s2">very much like to do that and there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.089" end="00:46:28.130" style="s2">be some more of that going</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.580" end="00:46:30.020" style="s2">I&#39;ll try and figure out how we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.130" end="00:46:34.190" style="s2">make that work how we could make it</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.020" end="00:46:37.940" style="s2">available to people because I understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.190" end="00:46:40.550" style="s2">the interest because again and this will</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.940" end="00:46:43.220" style="s2">come up and and and I&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.550" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">filming one of these episodes soon but</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.220" end="00:46:49.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be coming out till much</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:52.369" style="s2">later I guess maybe January of 2020 well</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.580" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">good I&#39;m filming an episode on Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.369" end="00:46:56.930" style="s2">and that sort of ideological argument</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:46:59.300" style="s2">and how it overlaps with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.930" end="00:47:01.010" style="s2">work done from you know the lake off and</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.300" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">Johnson framer I&#39;m gonna be talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.010" end="00:47:05.930" style="s2">about that so yeah I think it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.369" style="s2">and of course Heidegger who&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.930" end="00:47:09.770" style="s2">brings this up and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.369" end="00:47:12.020" style="s2">etymological arguments so I&#39;m that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.770" end="00:47:14.089" style="s2">very good request I&#39;m gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.020" end="00:47:17.060" style="s2">figure out in conjunction with that how</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.089" end="00:47:18.380" style="s2">to put together so some of the animal</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.060" end="00:47:21.230" style="s2">article resources although there you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.380" end="00:47:23.560" style="s2">should know that there are some very</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.230" end="00:47:27.560" style="s2">good etymological dictionaries out there</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.560" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">and online and you might want to begin</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.560" end="00:47:32.869" style="s2">by consulting them but I if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:34.609" style="s2">interpreting you correctly you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.869" end="00:47:36.200" style="s2">more than just this sort of etymological</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.609" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">dictionary you&#39;d like me to perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.200" end="00:47:42.740" style="s2">comment on that Edda model how that on</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:45.020" style="s2">how that etymology is relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.740" end="00:47:47.690" style="s2">particular issues in the series how it</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.020" end="00:47:49.339" style="s2">pertains and so you want something more</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.690" end="00:47:50.810" style="s2">than just the etymological dictionary at</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.339" end="00:47:53.990" style="s2">least that&#39;s what I&#39;m presuming so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.810" end="00:47:58.700" style="s2">will try and figure out how to make that</p>

<p begin="00:49:16.550" end="00:49:24.310" style="s2">of time to that probably towards the end</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.640" end="00:49:24.310" style="s2">where I&#39;d sort of do a bit of wrap-up</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.960" end="00:49:32.270" style="s2">hmm there&#39;s many ways in which I think</p>

<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:55.630" style="s2">cyborgs we will cyborg with this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.160" end="00:50:58.210" style="s2">right and the computer you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.630" end="00:51:00.339" style="s2">computer-human interaction research is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.210" end="00:51:03.400" style="s2">growing dramatically because it turns</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.339" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">out as I&#39;ve mentioned right when you try</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.400" end="00:51:08.080" style="s2">and do computer brain interaction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:09.339" style="s2">not as hard as we thought it was going</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.080" end="00:51:10.839" style="s2">to be because the brain does this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.339" end="00:51:13.270" style="s2">wonderful thing because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.839" end="00:51:16.540" style="s2">natural-born cyborgs it redesigns itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.270" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">to try and optimize its integration into</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.540" end="00:51:20.890" style="s2">the interface with these technologies</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:24.490" style="s2">which is kind of science-fiction scary</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.890" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">right and but is that going to happen I</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.490" end="00:51:33.550" style="s2">see that happening and so the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:36.220" style="s2">what we are and our identity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.550" end="00:51:40.750" style="s2">like think about how we identify with</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.220" end="00:51:42.970" style="s2">this technology our clothing right right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.750" end="00:51:45.369" style="s2">and so our identity is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.970" end="00:51:46.930" style="s2">shifted and altered in a fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.369" end="00:51:49.480" style="s2">room and think about you how your</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.930" end="00:51:52.300" style="s2">identity is altered by this thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.480" end="00:51:54.220" style="s2">gonna be dramatically transformed in</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.300" end="00:51:56.619" style="s2">ways that are kind of unforeseeable as</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.220" end="00:51:59.349" style="s2">we more and more directly side work with</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.619" end="00:52:01.930" style="s2">this stuff what and what&#39;s that going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.349" end="00:52:04.119" style="s2">mean so I think that&#39;s gonna have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.930" end="00:52:06.339" style="s2">impact on the immune crisis then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.119" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">another one and I want to tread very</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.339" end="00:52:15.270" style="s2">lightly here and very respectfully but</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:20.109" style="s2">the advent of general AR like you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.270" end="00:52:22.839" style="s2">Darwin had an impact on our religious</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.650" end="00:52:37.330" style="s2">believe it&#39;s much more when we get</p>

<p begin="00:52:37.330" end="00:52:44.380" style="s2">gonna impact on ours our religious and</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.380" end="00:52:52.410" style="s2">going to make the Darwinian impact and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.589" end="00:52:57.609" style="s2">the copernica can the impact look small</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.410" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">what what if you what if you may meet a</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.220" end="00:53:56.560" style="s2">asking you to consider is that this will</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.099" end="00:53:59.820" style="s2">have an impact on our sense of who and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.560" end="00:54:04.300" style="s2">what we are that will be more profound</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.820" end="00:54:06.820" style="s2">than the Darwinian and the Copernican</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.300" end="00:54:09.220" style="s2">revolution and I think it will be</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.820" end="00:54:12.760" style="s2">exacerbated by the point I previously</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.220" end="00:54:15.339" style="s2">made that as that kind of autonomous AI</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.760" end="00:54:18.010" style="s2">emerges in a way that challenges our</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.339" end="00:54:21.970" style="s2">sense of uniqueness as spiritual beings</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.010" end="00:54:29.650" style="s2">we will already be deeply cyborgs with</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.970" end="00:54:31.349" style="s2">this AI so we have one or tweat like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.650" end="00:54:33.700" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in any sort of simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.349" end="00:54:36.030" style="s2">transhumanist utopia and which will get</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.700" end="00:54:40.390" style="s2">the rapture of the cyborgs or some</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.030" end="00:54:42.339" style="s2"> like that nor do I think the</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.770" end="00:55:04.630" style="s2">please look up let&#39;s talk about why the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.170" end="00:55:06.790" style="s2">creation of AI requires the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.630" end="00:55:08.859" style="s2">of wisdom on our part I think we have an</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.500" end="00:55:16.839" style="s2">such that as we cyborgs and make these</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.260" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">machines they do not just have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.839" end="00:55:22.060" style="s2">intelligence but they have rationality</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:31.290" style="s2">and wisdom and a capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.190" end="00:56:05.470" style="s2">relations one of the things I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:07.300" style="s2">to argue and this is why this difficult</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.470" end="00:56:10.780" style="s2">abstract material right now and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.300" end="00:56:12.940" style="s2">relevance realization is so important</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.780" end="00:56:16.119" style="s2">because I&#39;m going to use that to try and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.940" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">argue for a sense of spirituality that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.119" end="00:56:27.329" style="s2">will not be put at risk by the advent of</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.250" end="00:57:03.700" style="s2">maybe take one or two more questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.760" end="00:57:08.740" style="s2">that people might have and so a question</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.700" end="00:57:13.420" style="s2">is just coming up now I&#39;m really really</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.740" end="00:57:15.430" style="s2">pleased I can&#39;t follow all the chatting</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.420" end="00:57:20.010" style="s2">that&#39;s going on because it&#39;s so dense</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.430" end="00:57:24.610" style="s2">but I want to assure people that I do</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.010" end="00:57:28.930" style="s2">look at these the the chat later</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.610" end="00:57:29.950" style="s2">and and I find it very helpful so thank</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:41.350" style="s2">to me so one final question you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.980" end="00:57:43.290" style="s2">spoken about sport and movement</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.350" end="00:57:46.030" style="s2">practices do you see traditional sport</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.290" end="00:57:47.950" style="s2">Western team sport specifically as</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.030" end="00:57:50.530" style="s2">opposed to Eastern practices having</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.950" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">potential in the ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.530" end="00:57:54.520" style="s2">that get the harnessed in the future</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:56.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a really interesting question I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.520" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;m competent to answer it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.260" end="00:58:02.110" style="s2">because I have looked at sports</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:06.310" style="s2">psychology I&#39;m not completely ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.110" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">about it but the area I know about has</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.310" end="00:58:09.040" style="s2">to do on the coaching side and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:11.850" style="s2">relationship between the coach and the</p>

<p begin="00:58:11.850" end="00:58:18.850" style="s2">internalizing this age and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.380" end="00:58:20.680" style="s2">can I I don&#39;t like to comment where I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.850" end="00:58:26.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have any knowledge so I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.680" end="00:58:26.100" style="s2">comment on that aspect insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.550" end="00:58:35.530" style="s2">athletics western athletics depends on</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:40.060" style="s2">the coach athlete relationship I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.530" end="00:58:41.740" style="s2">that is a powerful way of training and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.060" end="00:58:44.590" style="s2">training in a way that you can put into</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.740" end="00:58:47.290" style="s2">action how to internalize a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.590" end="00:58:49.540" style="s2">perspective you know at least in this</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.210" end="00:59:34.120" style="s2">adult the adult is this age so I could</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.220" end="00:59:38.030" style="s2">see via that important relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.120" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">modern athletics a potential way</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.030" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">in which Western sports could contribute</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:47.210" style="s2">to responding to the meeting crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:50.050" style="s2">the way it gives people real engaged</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.210" end="00:59:51.650" style="s2">embodied in active practice in</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.050" end="00:59:53.900" style="s2">internalizing something at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.650" end="00:59:56.600" style="s2">analogous to the stage and that could</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.190" end="01:00:04.340" style="s2">exert that in cultivating the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.330" end="01:00:06.940" style="s2">genuinely or perhaps that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.340" end="01:00:10.010" style="s2">adjectives running ever more</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.940" end="01:00:13.340" style="s2">comprehensively and deeply internalize a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.010" end="01:00:15.260" style="s2">more profound sage figure and thereby I</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.340" end="01:00:18.920" style="s2">mean you know contribute again to that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.260" end="01:00:21.110" style="s2">sort of top-down capacity to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.920" end="01:00:26.870" style="s2">an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.110" end="01:00:30.020" style="s2">oh that that question came from the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.870" end="01:00:32.420" style="s2">patreon supporter Andre stringer so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.020" end="01:00:34.370" style="s2">thank you very much for that Andre now</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.420" end="01:00:36.860" style="s2">as you know I think there&#39;s also wet</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.370" end="01:00:39.320" style="s2">some Western movement practices in</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.860" end="01:00:42.560" style="s2">general outside sports that I think are</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.320" end="01:00:45.380" style="s2">very important so in October I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.560" end="01:00:47.660" style="s2">to go down to one of the retreats</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.380" end="01:00:49.610" style="s2">offered by Rafe Kelly you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.660" end="01:00:52.070" style="s2">evolved move play and some of you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.610" end="01:00:54.230" style="s2">have seen some of the two of the really</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.070" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">I think interesting I found them very</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.230" end="01:00:57.590" style="s2">interesting interviews that I had with</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">rape</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.590" end="01:01:02.090" style="s2">so Rafe has basically created an ecology</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">of practices in which the movement</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.090" end="01:01:09.710" style="s2">practice of parkour parkour out in</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:11.330" style="s2">nature it plays a central role in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.710" end="01:01:12.650" style="s2">ecology of practices that he&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.330" end="01:01:14.540" style="s2">together for his community it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.650" end="01:01:16.070" style="s2">interesting at you do you do the parkour</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.540" end="01:01:17.690" style="s2">out of nature then there&#39;s comeback and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.070" end="01:01:21.500" style="s2">there&#39;s something like a circulating</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.690" end="01:01:24.080" style="s2">practice around the campfire so I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.500" end="01:01:26.450" style="s2">that is also very important and I hope</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.080" end="01:01:29.150" style="s2">to have more insight about how that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.450" end="01:01:30.500" style="s2">might operate after I&#39;ve been there on</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.150" end="01:01:34.490" style="s2">October and I&#39;m really looking forward</p>
