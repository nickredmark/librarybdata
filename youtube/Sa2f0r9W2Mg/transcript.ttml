<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">certainly when we campaign I mean now we</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">draw crowds of other hundreds or</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">thousands depending upon where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing now let&#39;s just dig into it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">we&#39;re in this totally bizarre situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">faced up to just how dire our situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">is when I go outside for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">the physical world is still humming</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">along but everywhere else you can see</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.069" style="s2">the signs that some have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:15.189" style="s2">superstructure that undergirds</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.069" end="00:02:17.019" style="s2">the simple physical reality thing am I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.189" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">wrong about that no I I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.019" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">you know and and in in many ways if</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">you&#39;re just living life not plugged into</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:26.170" style="s2">all of the institutional decay then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:29.110" style="s2">just go out in the sun shining and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">birds are chirping and you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.110" end="00:02:33.700" style="s2">said the physical world is still more or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:37.329" style="s2">less sound barring the occasional heat</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.700" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">wave and an unseasonal weather pattern</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.329" end="00:02:44.500" style="s2">so the way I see it effectively what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.040" end="00:02:45.970" style="s2">have is a world of institutions and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:47.829" style="s2">have the wrong people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.970" end="00:02:50.139" style="s2">institutions in fact what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.829" end="00:02:51.579" style="s2">somehow that the institutions were built</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.139" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">in an era where things were growing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.579" end="00:02:56.889" style="s2">rapidly the growth pattern changed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">heck of a long time ago almost 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.889" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">ago and so for what they&#39;ve done is they</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:03.970" style="s2">these institutions have selected for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:07.079" style="s2">people who can continue to tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.970" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">about growth and to kind of play games</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.079" end="00:03:12.489" style="s2">to keep the illusion that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:15.159" style="s2">still humming along as if it was the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.489" end="00:03:18.069" style="s2">and 60s but that hasn&#39;t been true for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.159" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">long time how far off am i well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.069" end="00:03:21.699" style="s2">what the numbers saying and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:23.879" style="s2">numbers guy where if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.699" end="00:03:26.139" style="s2">economy of the 70s you had a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.879" end="00:03:28.870" style="s2">level of buying power among the middle</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.139" end="00:03:31.329" style="s2">class and certain split in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.870" end="00:03:33.669" style="s2">gains from the economy among different</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.329" end="00:03:35.739" style="s2">parts of society and then the lines</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.669" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">start to diverge starting in the 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.739" end="00:03:40.389" style="s2">now they&#39;re incredibly divergent where</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">you have middle-class incomes</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.389" end="00:03:44.590" style="s2">essentially unchanged during that time</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">and then people at the very top level</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.590" end="00:03:49.090" style="s2">absorbing more more and more of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">gains in the winner-take-all economy but</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.090" end="00:03:55.750" style="s2">we all pretend like it&#39;s still the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">and you can see the disconnect in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.750" end="00:03:59.709" style="s2">the lived experience of most Americans</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">in mostly country where they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.709" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">to catch on that things have changed and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:06.190" style="s2">it&#39;s dark it&#39;s it&#39;s dark it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:07.569" style="s2">incredibly dark and it&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.190" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">laughing about I think for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.569" end="00:04:11.079" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.310" end="00:04:12.970" style="s2">humor about it we&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.079" end="00:04:14.949" style="s2">able to easily do the work so I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.970" end="00:04:16.840" style="s2">whistling past the graveyard and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.949" end="00:04:18.430" style="s2">gallows humor definitely there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.840" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">a place for that well I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.430" end="00:04:25.810" style="s2">naturally I suppose people have said to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:27.610" style="s2">me that I have a very dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:30.280" style="s2">point of view but I tend to present it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.610" end="00:04:31.510" style="s2">in a positive upbeat manner I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.280" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get us through a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.510" end="00:04:37.150" style="s2">bottleneck that you and I both know is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">coming and that in essence I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.150" end="00:04:41.080" style="s2">the things I&#39;m very concerned about with</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:43.180" style="s2">you is that I don&#39;t want you to promise</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.080" end="00:04:44.770" style="s2">the world that you know how to do this I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.180" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">want you just to say that I&#39;m the best</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.770" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">person data but whatever is coming next</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:50.740" style="s2">because nobody knows what to do well</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:52.450" style="s2">certainly I would never claim I&#39;m nishan</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.740" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">sore that I&#39;m gonna get everything right</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.450" end="00:04:56.169" style="s2">I mean I make mistakes all the time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:05:00.669" style="s2">ask my wife she&#39;d be like yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.169" end="00:05:02.229" style="s2">screwed up the other day but we you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.669" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">I were talking before the camera started</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.229" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">rolling that I think it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">very dark time and the goal has to be to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">try and survive the darkness and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:17.080" style="s2">have it produce existential level harm</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">and I believe that I can assist in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.080" end="00:05:20.889" style="s2">regard but I certainly would never say</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:22.570" style="s2">that like I have all the answers or that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.889" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">if I&#39;m president everything&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.570" end="00:05:27.580" style="s2">right because the fact is there there</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:29.139" style="s2">are two things I&#39;ve thought about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:31.630" style="s2">like there&#39;s the way the president makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.139" end="00:05:34.300" style="s2">you feel right and then there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.630" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">actually solving problems on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">and right now our experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:43.270" style="s2">presidency tends to be around a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:46.030" style="s2">like if Donald Trump does something</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.270" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">irrational it really does not affect my</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.030" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">day-to-day existence except for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:51.910" style="s2">that I see all the news reports and oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:53.470" style="s2">my god that guy what&#39;s he doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.910" end="00:05:55.539" style="s2">and the same is true in Reverse like if</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.470" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">Barack Obama did something decent and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.539" end="00:06:01.510" style="s2">human it made me feel good didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">necessarily you know like change my</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.510" end="00:06:08.110" style="s2">commute sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s the way it makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.110" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">us feel which I believe I can assist</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">with just about immediately for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:18.220" style="s2">who you know wants someone who seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:20.620" style="s2">solutions-oriented right positive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.220" end="00:06:22.690" style="s2">positive they did data friendly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.620" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">they&#39;re friendly and genuinely wants to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.690" end="00:06:25.030" style="s2">just try and make people&#39;s lives better</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:26.289" style="s2">I think that would make people feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.030" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">better but then there&#39;s the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.289" end="00:06:30.910" style="s2">trying to solve the problems from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:34.090" style="s2">perch at the top of the government yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.910" end="00:06:37.659" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very different process</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.090" end="00:06:39.400" style="s2">you know I&#39;m locked in on this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.659" end="00:06:40.419" style="s2">freedom dividend in part</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.400" end="00:06:42.280" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.419" end="00:06:44.290" style="s2">dramatically positive thing we could do</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.280" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">that we could actually effectuate in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.290" end="00:06:48.639" style="s2">real life that would improve people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:51.639" style="s2">lives that we can actually get done now</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:54.520" style="s2">I am both positive and negative about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.639" end="00:06:56.290" style="s2">as you probably remember what my belief</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.520" end="00:06:58.380" style="s2">is is that we have two claims as</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.290" end="00:07:00.520" style="s2">Americans we have a claim as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.380" end="00:07:02.949" style="s2">contributor to the economy and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:06.340" style="s2">claim as a sole because we happen to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.949" end="00:07:09.040" style="s2">live here and as a soul we have certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.340" end="00:07:12.010" style="s2">rights as a human being just as a member</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.040" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">of society the weaker of the two is as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.010" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">soul but that claim still exists and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">some sense what you&#39;re calling the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">freedom dividend or universal basic</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">income speaks to the idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:27.639" style="s2">these two competing claims and you you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:30.699" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get rid of the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.639" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">structure that allows people to you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.699" end="00:07:35.020" style="s2">take a dream and turn it into something</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:37.660" style="s2">I love the dream I love work I love</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.020" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">entrepreneurship yeah and this is people</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.660" end="00:07:42.310" style="s2">doing great stuff so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a theory that there&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.310" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">series of economic theories that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.680" end="00:07:48.669" style="s2">actually been developed and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.669" end="00:07:53.500" style="s2">me is that we retake the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:56.020" style="s2">because what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:07:58.330" style="s2">selected for people who have used very</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.020" end="00:08:00.760" style="s2">simplistic models that have had a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.330" end="00:08:03.430" style="s2">effect on transferring wealth but have</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.760" end="00:08:05.620" style="s2">not actually mirrored our our problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.430" end="00:08:08.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve selected for the people who really</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.620" end="00:08:11.139" style="s2">don&#39;t tell the truth and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.470" end="00:08:13.389" style="s2">worried how let&#39;s talk about your your</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.139" end="00:08:17.080" style="s2">your first term in office which is gonna</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.080" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a blast you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.930" end="00:08:23.500" style="s2">there P is gonna be there yang Yang is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.060" end="00:08:25.210" style="s2">gonna be there and have a giant party</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.500" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">wait wait wait wait a second get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.210" end="00:08:29.889" style="s2">of us who are you gonna staff your</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:31.990" style="s2">government with if you&#39;re gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.889" end="00:08:34.180" style="s2">same problem that everybody has which</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.990" end="00:08:37.209" style="s2">once you&#39;ve caught once the dog catches</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.180" end="00:08:38.979" style="s2">the car then what you&#39;ve got all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.209" end="00:08:40.690" style="s2">these institutions which have selected</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.979" end="00:08:43.870" style="s2">four economists who don&#39;t tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.690" end="00:08:46.089" style="s2">who who&#39;ve selected four sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.870" end="00:08:48.790" style="s2">who are friendly to the institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.089" end="00:08:50.890" style="s2">hostile to our people what do we do my</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.790" end="00:08:53.110" style="s2">team is going to be a blend of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.890" end="00:08:55.060" style="s2">people with different experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.110" end="00:08:58.570" style="s2">that&#39;s from different industries even</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.060" end="00:09:01.870" style="s2">different ideologies and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.570" end="00:09:04.360" style="s2">need some people who are DC insiders who</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.870" end="00:09:05.470" style="s2">have relationships on Capitol Hill if</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.360" end="00:09:07.329" style="s2">you really want to get things done</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.470" end="00:09:10.390" style="s2">because you&#39;re talking about possibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.329" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">the most institutionalized town in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.390" end="00:09:14.230" style="s2">society and so if you get there and just</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:17.110" style="s2">like I&#39;m gonna staff it with outsiders</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.230" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">then nobody does Trump&#39;s problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.110" end="00:09:20.529" style="s2">like you&#39;re not gonna get anything done</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:22.269" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re just going to be fighting</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.529" end="00:09:23.829" style="s2">with the system all the time that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.269" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be like these antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.829" end="00:09:29.589" style="s2">that treat you like this hostile agent</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">and then they&#39;re going to just make your</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.589" end="00:09:33.100" style="s2">life miserable at every turn I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way organizations work</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:37.810" style="s2">its way cultures work and so you need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">have a blend of people that are like</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.810" end="00:09:43.320" style="s2">look hey I get it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:47.320" style="s2">I&#39;m a new figure and you&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.320" end="00:09:49.810" style="s2">and one of my principles is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.320" end="00:09:52.180" style="s2">fault people for the incentives that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.810" end="00:09:53.709" style="s2">have formed them mmm-hmm and but by this</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.180" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">what I mean is like if you show up in DC</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.709" end="00:09:58.269" style="s2">and there&#39;s someone who&#39;s been part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:10:04.089" style="s2">the fabric of DC for twenty plus years</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.269" end="00:10:05.769" style="s2">and they are someone who been through</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.089" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">administrations right and left is sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.769" end="00:10:10.029" style="s2">of survived the whole thing and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">goal is to just keep that function going</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.029" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">and make sure they get to retirement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">whatnot like you can&#39;t blame that person</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">for being part of that system because</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what their events items have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">for years and years and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.550" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do is you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:25.209" style="s2">get there and be like I&#39;m gonna like</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">turn everything upside down I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.209" end="00:10:28.420" style="s2">attack everyone with the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.860" end="00:10:30.940" style="s2">we&#39;ll just actually you know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.420" end="00:10:32.110" style="s2">macrophages will descend on you and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.940" end="00:10:34.029" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll never get anything done</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.110" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">ever anything that so that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.029" end="00:10:38.290" style="s2">the answers that I was dying to hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">which is I&#39;m gonna have to work with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.290" end="00:10:42.100" style="s2">infrastructure that&#39;s already there but</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:44.019" style="s2">then there&#39;s the second part of it which</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.100" end="00:10:47.199" style="s2">is that I actually need to see some</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.019" end="00:10:49.899" style="s2">people permanently ejected called out</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.199" end="00:10:51.790" style="s2">chastise who have been this class of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.899" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">people miss advising our government</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.790" end="00:10:57.490" style="s2">throughout the 80s 90s early part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">century well and that&#39;s a dark part for</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.490" end="00:11:01.420" style="s2">all of us that we sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.770" style="s2">really limited accountability in DC like</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.420" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">you can give bad advice and screw</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.770" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">something up and you keep your job</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:10.450" style="s2">Tagg still there like it like no one</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.890" style="s2">goes back and says hey your white paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.450" end="00:11:17.320" style="s2">turns out it was completely mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.890" end="00:11:21.090" style="s2">like that hey that&#39;s not the way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.320" end="00:11:24.250" style="s2">town works or that you know many</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.090" end="00:11:27.160" style="s2">government institutions work so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.250" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">the challenge is that you have to try</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.160" end="00:11:34.330" style="s2">and make changes within this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:36.490" style="s2">institutionalized environment and so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.330" end="00:11:38.680" style="s2">need a combination of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.490" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">well intended you bring them in and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.680" end="00:11:43.420" style="s2">look there&#39;s gonna feel like brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:44.470" style="s2">damage you&#39;re gonna come in right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.420" end="00:11:46.090" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be like especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.470" end="00:11:49.810" style="s2">can&#39;t come in with the background like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.090" end="00:11:51.070" style="s2">you and I might have from technology or</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.810" end="00:11:52.600" style="s2">entrepreneurship where you look up and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.070" end="00:11:54.070" style="s2">you&#39;d be like wait you have how many</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.600" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">people doing what and you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.070" end="00:11:57.970" style="s2">to do what you know it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">story of like healthcare.gov where like</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.970" end="00:12:01.330" style="s2">the website didn&#39;t work in part because</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">they hired a giant consulting firm and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.330" end="00:12:04.330" style="s2">they had all these bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:05.530" style="s2">processes and then when the website</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.330" end="00:12:08.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t work you know what they did they</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.530" end="00:12:10.330" style="s2">hired a bunch of maverick Valley types</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.330" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">or that did a repair job so the the goal</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.740" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">has to be to bring in Patriots who</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:22.510" style="s2">understand that they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:24.520" style="s2">have like an enjoyable time trying to</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.380" end="00:12:35.560" style="s2">turned it you know like Andrew I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.910" end="00:12:37.780" style="s2">we&#39;re in a much more revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">situation and in part to energize people</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.780" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">I mean what we&#39;re talking about is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:47.500" style="s2">Revenge of competency a revenge of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:50.760" style="s2">genius a revenge of people who actually</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.760" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">who are ready and want to be mobilized</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.220" end="00:13:02.620" style="s2">skills and did the minors or worse and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">the fact is is that what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.620" end="00:13:07.240" style="s2">institutions have done have inverted the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:09.100" style="s2">competency hierarchy I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.240" end="00:13:11.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy that I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.100" end="00:13:13.990" style="s2">named Brad DeLong who was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.620" end="00:13:15.910" style="s2">group that brought in NAFTA and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.990" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">they helped to sell this idea that free</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.910" end="00:13:20.020" style="s2">trade was good for everybody and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">years later I hear oh you know what free</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.020" end="00:13:22.330" style="s2">trade actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:24.940" style="s2">there was an esoteric version an</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.330" end="00:13:26.830" style="s2">exoteric version the exoteric version we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.940" end="00:13:28.540" style="s2">put on display for everybody we always</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.830" end="00:13:30.339" style="s2">knew that the in the esoteric version</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">that was shared in the seminar rooms</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.339" end="00:13:34.870" style="s2">that it was a social Darwinist welfare</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:37.060" style="s2">function that rewarded you by the cube</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.870" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">of your wealth and I just sit there with</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.060" end="00:13:42.010" style="s2">my jaw on the floor thinking what did</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">you just say and then he says like I</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.010" end="00:13:45.310" style="s2">don&#39;t understand maybe we hurt people in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:47.709" style="s2">Ohio but we helped a lot of Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.310" end="00:13:49.690" style="s2">peasants and I&#39;m thinking so you think</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.709" end="00:13:52.769" style="s2">that the American voters who you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.690" end="00:13:55.480" style="s2">called jingoistic and you know alt</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.769" end="00:13:57.459" style="s2">ultra-nationalists are going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.480" end="00:13:59.589" style="s2">happy that you&#39;ve denigrated their</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.459" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">patriotism and now what they have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.589" end="00:14:02.980" style="s2">show for it is is that there are Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:04.899" style="s2">peasants who are significantly better at</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.980" end="00:14:09.459" style="s2">which I mean who doesn&#39;t want Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.899" end="00:14:11.589" style="s2">peasants to be better off but for sake I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.459" end="00:14:15.430" style="s2">mean this is this is a class of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.589" end="00:14:17.260" style="s2">that needs to lose yeah and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.430" end="00:14:19.720" style="s2">them are gonna lose or my administration</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.260" end="00:14:22.540" style="s2">like I&#39;m not a generally vindictive</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.720" end="00:14:24.700" style="s2">person no it&#39;s that I look you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.540" end="00:14:26.290" style="s2">hope he has a happy wonderful life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.700" end="00:14:28.690" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s a kind of thing where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.290" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">like hey guess what you had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:34.770" style="s2">influence and authority in one ERA it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.520" style="s2">over now like you know not going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.770" end="00:14:38.140" style="s2">unduly but trying to make your life</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.520" end="00:14:40.029" style="s2">miserable or anything but you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.140" end="00:14:43.420" style="s2">exactly where there&#39;s nothing vindictive</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.029" end="00:14:45.670" style="s2">it&#39;s just I don&#39;t want to watch the Alan</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.420" end="00:14:48.279" style="s2">Greenspan show or the Larry Summers show</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.670" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">or the Paul Krugman I don&#39;t really need</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.279" end="00:14:52.690" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason that these people get</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:55.690" style="s2">to be in every scene in every decade ad</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.690" end="00:14:57.640" style="s2">infinitum yeah again like I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.690" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">really no accountability for being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.640" end="00:15:02.680" style="s2">and so if someone presided over an era</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:05.649" style="s2">where you know there was epic</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.680" end="00:15:08.709" style="s2">mismanagement um you know we still are</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.649" end="00:15:09.940" style="s2">asking them what the heck they think can</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.709" end="00:15:13.990" style="s2">I hit you with another one that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.940" end="00:15:17.709" style="s2">comical for me sure I watch the graphics</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.990" end="00:15:19.390" style="s2">that have your name in in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.709" end="00:15:21.100" style="s2">to the other competitors and I know who</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.390" end="00:15:23.230" style="s2">the network&#39;s are afraid of and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.100" end="00:15:25.029" style="s2">afraid of you they&#39;ll do a linear</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.230" end="00:15:26.470" style="s2">perspective graphic and you&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.029" end="00:15:28.089" style="s2">guy on the very far end and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.470" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">presenter will stand to notice that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.089" end="00:15:31.240" style="s2">does seem to be something about well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">don&#39;t think you should be bringing it up</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.240" end="00:15:33.939" style="s2">I think the job is for people like me to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:35.169" style="s2">be bringing</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.939" end="00:15:37.689" style="s2">this up because they&#39;ve been playing</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.169" end="00:15:40.209" style="s2">this game with like Ron Paul with Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.689" end="00:15:42.489" style="s2">Sanders and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.209" end="00:15:46.209" style="s2">familiar in magic with the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.489" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">magician&#39;s choice no I&#39;m not so a</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.209" end="00:15:48.579" style="s2">magician</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:50.439" style="s2">it engages in a trick with magicians</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.579" end="00:15:55.929" style="s2">choice let&#39;s say that I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.439" end="00:15:59.049" style="s2">choose C out of a B and C so I give you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.929" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">the option pick two you pick a and B and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.049" end="00:16:04.029" style="s2">I say okay I&#39;ll take those away so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.639" end="00:16:05.529" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at C or if you pick a and C</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.029" end="00:16:07.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll say okay we&#39;ll take one of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.529" end="00:16:09.729" style="s2">two will throw B away now which one do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.720" end="00:16:12.069" style="s2">you so eventually you think you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.729" end="00:16:14.169" style="s2">a decision but in fact the whole game</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.069" end="00:16:15.909" style="s2">was is that the magician was pushing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.169" end="00:16:17.679" style="s2">without your knowledge and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.909" end="00:16:19.539" style="s2">what idea companies choice this is what</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.679" end="00:16:22.659" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a media companies choice</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.539" end="00:16:25.329" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got a situation where my</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.659" end="00:16:27.970" style="s2">feeling is that the more the yang gang</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.329" end="00:16:30.579" style="s2">can find and this goes for tulsi gabbard</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.970" end="00:16:33.039" style="s2">or whoever else might be sidelined by</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.579" end="00:16:34.869" style="s2">this game my feeling is is that what</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.039" end="00:16:37.059" style="s2">you&#39;re on right now is the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.869" end="00:16:38.949" style="s2">pirate radio this is some is dot for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.059" end="00:16:40.599" style="s2">American people and we sure you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.949" end="00:16:42.069" style="s2">it&#39;s one reason I&#39;m here man when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.599" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">one of the reasons that we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.069" end="00:16:48.159" style="s2">sure that these channels are opened to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:50.139" style="s2">the very people that the DNC doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.159" end="00:16:52.359" style="s2">want running or the network&#39;s don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.139" end="00:16:53.679" style="s2">running and the thing that I hate is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.359" end="00:16:56.049" style="s2">that we&#39;re in this William Tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.679" end="00:16:59.529" style="s2">situation where we&#39;ve got to run against</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.529" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">and you may not want to say that and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:06.939" style="s2">understand why but I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.639" end="00:17:31.899" style="s2">institutions with certain incentives and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.379" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">certain relationships and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.899" end="00:17:37.059" style="s2">to be naturally protective of the folks</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.059" end="00:17:42.460" style="s2">naturally very leery of the people that</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.460" end="00:17:47.139" style="s2">the themes of this era is that there are</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.530" end="00:18:26.220" style="s2">true and everything you say that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.120" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">isn&#39;t new so it&#39;s like remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.220" end="00:18:34.140" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing I can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:36.930" style="s2">contribute to the conversation it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.140" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">said Eric yeah Ben the only stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.930" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">hasn&#39;t is wrong so what I&#39;d love to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:46.470" style="s2">is to talk about some some sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">ideas to undergird some of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.470" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">things that you and I have traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">talked about more before your meteoric</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:55.110" style="s2">rise so let&#39;s dig into it now please</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.330" style="s2">okay so one of the things that pieces I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.110" end="00:18:59.010" style="s2">want to say that I quote this man all</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.330" end="00:19:03.180" style="s2">the time I&#39;ve learned a great deal from</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.010" end="00:19:06.090" style="s2">him and his wife and that he&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.180" end="00:19:07.470" style="s2">the most profound economic thinkers that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.090" end="00:19:10.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve encountered and I met a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.470" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">fucking people you&#39;re very kind sir and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.410" end="00:19:14.220" style="s2">one of the things that I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:16.680" style="s2">that even when I disagree with you even</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.220" end="00:19:18.390" style="s2">on your signature stuff that the way I</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.680" end="00:19:20.790" style="s2">really view you is is that you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.390" end="00:19:22.950" style="s2">candidate who is most open to new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.790" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re always up for a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.950" end="00:19:26.670" style="s2">discussion a good argument and you&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:29.610" style="s2">with whatever&#39;s best and I find that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.670" end="00:19:31.470" style="s2">are as close to non egoic as anyone I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.610" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">met Renny I mean you really seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.470" end="00:19:37.880" style="s2">running out of compulsion yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:40.050" style="s2">I don&#39;t have any native desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.880" end="00:19:41.580" style="s2">President I didn&#39;t feel that you ever</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.050" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">did was one of the reasons I love the</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.580" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">fact that you&#39;re running yeah I I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.830" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">about one of my main qualifications to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:51.030" style="s2">be President yeah is that I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:53.700" style="s2">socialize that much in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.030" end="00:19:56.130" style="s2">if you have me around a bunch of fancy</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.700" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">stuff like it really doesn&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.130" end="00:19:59.640" style="s2">for me like you know as president I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:00.909" style="s2">would love to do away with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.640" end="00:20:04.869" style="s2">you do like Kiki</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.909" end="00:20:09.279" style="s2">the ceremony like it seems like like</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.869" end="00:20:10.929" style="s2">it&#39;s counterproductive and no III have I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.279" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t I think that might help me do a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.929" end="00:20:15.460" style="s2">better job so let&#39;s try to geek out on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:16.570" style="s2">couple of ideas that P and I have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.460" end="00:20:18.519" style="s2">playing with see what you think yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.570" end="00:20:20.649" style="s2">love it okay so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.519" end="00:20:22.659" style="s2">we&#39;ve been thinking about is some people</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.649" end="00:20:24.879" style="s2">start talking about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.659" end="00:20:26.739" style="s2">between the shareholder economy of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.879" end="00:20:29.559" style="s2">past and the stakeholder economy of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.739" end="00:20:34.090" style="s2">future yeah there are other issues about</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.559" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">the dignity of work and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:38.139" style="s2">when machines replace you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:40.269" style="s2">necessarily defend yourself economically</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.139" end="00:20:41.950" style="s2">but you still have a reason to get up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.269" end="00:20:43.029" style="s2">the morning and do something oh we hope</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.950" end="00:20:44.169" style="s2">you have a reason there you get up and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.029" end="00:20:48.399" style="s2">do something amen</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.169" end="00:20:50.289" style="s2">now the thing is we&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.399" end="00:20:52.269" style="s2">about this paradigm from object-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.289" end="00:20:56.679" style="s2">programming which is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.269" end="00:21:00.149" style="s2">between is ax versus has ax so if a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.679" end="00:21:02.619" style="s2">Lamborghini can play a an FM broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.149" end="00:21:05.710" style="s2">through its speaker you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.619" end="00:21:07.809" style="s2">technically find out that by some</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.710" end="00:21:10.179" style="s2">definition the labrum borghini is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.809" end="00:21:12.669" style="s2">radio but that seems absurd it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.179" end="00:21:15.629" style="s2">it&#39;s more sane to say that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.669" end="00:21:18.789" style="s2">radio just the way it has a transmission</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.629" end="00:21:21.340" style="s2">we make this error I think when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.789" end="00:21:24.789" style="s2">about workers we say that person is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.340" end="00:21:27.849" style="s2">worker they are a bricklayer or or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.789" end="00:21:30.340" style="s2">teamster you know completely and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.849" end="00:21:33.009" style="s2">what we need to do is to readjust our</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.340" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">model of an economic agent to a has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.009" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">model and so the idea is that you may</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">have a breadwinner and you also have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">contributor and you also have a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:46.419" style="s2">and therefore what it is that we do all</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:48.309" style="s2">day long in the face of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.419" end="00:21:50.200" style="s2">automation that may or may not get here</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.309" end="00:21:53.769" style="s2">in dribs and drabs or come as a wave we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.200" end="00:21:57.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we need to have a model</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.769" end="00:22:00.129" style="s2">of humans that recognizes a need to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.970" end="00:22:01.570" style="s2">active in the economy whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.129" end="00:22:03.879" style="s2">marginal product of our labor is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.570" end="00:22:06.429" style="s2">sufficient to take care of our family</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.879" end="00:22:07.119" style="s2">yeah I I love it so much and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.429" end="00:22:09.339" style="s2">agree more</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.119" end="00:22:12.279" style="s2">ok so that that would be the kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.339" end="00:22:14.740" style="s2">research program that we would love to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.279" end="00:22:17.559" style="s2">try to see under girding a new week</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.740" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">economy that recognizes a much richer</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.559" end="00:22:23.860" style="s2">concept of an agent but without it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:25.960" style="s2">worried that you know the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.860" end="00:22:28.500" style="s2">power of that chicago-style thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.960" end="00:22:31.179" style="s2">pushes us back into humans as widgets</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.500" end="00:22:34.300" style="s2">well humans as widgets is predominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.179" end="00:22:35.800" style="s2">and you can see it at every turn or even</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.300" end="00:22:37.210" style="s2">if you ask a kid what do you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.800" end="00:22:40.420" style="s2">when you grow up it&#39;s you know they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.210" end="00:22:42.910" style="s2">say I want to be a fireman astronaut</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.420" end="00:22:46.090" style="s2">baker scientist whatever it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.910" end="00:22:48.760" style="s2">be and by the numbers we are more work</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.090" end="00:22:52.660" style="s2">obsessed now than we perhaps have ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:57.130" style="s2">been and trying to break up our</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.660" end="00:22:59.410" style="s2">identities sure into several aspects</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.130" end="00:23:01.330" style="s2">where you take a trucker who&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.410" end="00:23:03.790" style="s2">road away from his family four days a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.330" end="00:23:10.150" style="s2">week and say you know you&#39;re a dad</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.790" end="00:23:13.390" style="s2">you&#39;re like a consumer of of hunting</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.150" end="00:23:15.850" style="s2">gear or you know like you there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.390" end="00:23:18.730" style="s2">to you than being a trucker when they</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.850" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">have shaped their life around being a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.730" end="00:23:23.800" style="s2">trucker because you know it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">you&#39;re behind the wheel for 14 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.800" end="00:23:29.910" style="s2">day you get out you sleep at a rest stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">I mean these are all consuming types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.910" end="00:23:36.429" style="s2">existences that are filled by hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.809" style="s2">of thousands of American men and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.429" end="00:23:39.640" style="s2">know ninety-four percent of them are men</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.809" end="00:23:43.450" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s not like oh just things</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.640" end="00:23:45.309" style="s2">are all men it&#39;s like come on 94% and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.450" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">if you were to go to that person and try</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.309" end="00:23:49.570" style="s2">and have them adopt a more holistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">identity when they have essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.570" end="00:23:59.140" style="s2">shaped their entire existence around</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:24:01.480" style="s2">their role in this real life like almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.140" end="00:24:03.070" style="s2">circulatory system where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.480" end="00:24:06.309" style="s2">they&#39;re piloting this blood vessel that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.070" end="00:24:07.210" style="s2">has a bunch of Home Depot crap in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.309" end="00:24:12.580" style="s2">batter or whatever the heck they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.210" end="00:24:15.640" style="s2">transporting like a daily basis having</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.429" end="00:24:21.700" style="s2">where you could remove the work</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:24.559" style="s2">component and they would you know be</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.700" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">cool with going home and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.559" end="00:24:31.460" style="s2">spending time with their their families</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.220" end="00:24:33.230" style="s2">is pretty much the opposite of the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.460" end="00:24:35.379" style="s2">our civilization functions right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:39.619" style="s2">what we saw these deaths of despair</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.379" end="00:24:41.720" style="s2">discussed by economists and in you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.619" end="00:24:46.009" style="s2">the heartland of America we saw this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.720" end="00:24:49.850" style="s2">demographic crisis that happened when</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.009" end="00:24:53.090" style="s2">this Soviet Union fell apart with you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.850" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">know the mortality crisis all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.090" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">people were dying of alcoholism heart</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:59.509" style="s2">attacks and stress so this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">serious thing we had figure about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.509" end="00:25:05.330" style="s2">restoration of human meaning and dignity</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.869" style="s2">as different from employment you had</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.330" end="00:25:10.340" style="s2">something like a dozen disenfranchised</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.869" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">taxi cab drivers and limo drivers kill</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">of whom two killed himself in front of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.389" end="00:25:20.210" style="s2">City Hall I mean like did his self</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.600" end="00:25:22.369" style="s2">destruction cause meaningful ripples in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.210" end="00:25:23.749" style="s2">our society no most people watching this</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.369" end="00:25:25.669" style="s2">listening is right now it&#39;s like oh that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.749" end="00:25:27.470" style="s2">should happen like you know that like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.669" end="00:25:30.499" style="s2">but this sort of self-destruction is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.470" end="00:25:33.169" style="s2">happening all the time and most of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.499" end="00:25:34.700" style="s2">are just men quietly drinking themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.169" end="00:25:38.869" style="s2">to death in their homes Ryan you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.700" end="00:25:40.489" style="s2">they&#39;re dead but well I love the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.869" end="00:25:42.019" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about compassion for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.489" end="00:25:45.109" style="s2">men because one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.019" end="00:25:47.059" style="s2">finding is that it&#39;s very tough to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.109" end="00:25:50.239" style="s2">in a know in a world that is currently</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.059" end="00:25:52.070" style="s2">exploring this idea of toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.239" end="00:25:53.749" style="s2">from someplace that it might have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.070" end="00:25:57.470" style="s2">reasonably defined and blowing it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.749" end="00:26:00.470" style="s2">past past that point it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.470" end="00:26:02.379" style="s2">dangerous thing to see a world that sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.470" end="00:26:04.820" style="s2">of thinks that you know like all</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.379" end="00:26:06.350" style="s2">straight white guys are okay when in</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.820" end="00:26:08.809" style="s2">fact many of them are very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.350" end="00:26:12.529" style="s2">and and by the numbers you by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.809" end="00:26:14.509" style="s2">numbers right you know yeah it&#39;s so and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.529" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">this is one of the themes that when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.509" end="00:26:20.269" style="s2">talk about trying to define people by</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:23.179" style="s2">different aspects of their life that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.269" end="00:26:25.639" style="s2">might have work as one of them but</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.179" end="00:26:28.700" style="s2">rather like others the fact is I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.639" end="00:26:31.970" style="s2">men struggle more with breaking up our</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.700" end="00:26:33.049" style="s2">identities than women do because if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.970" end="00:26:35.690" style="s2">were to say to a woman</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.049" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">hey you&#39;re a parent you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.690" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">sister your</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">right a nurse you&#39;re like all of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:44.780" style="s2">things I think they would be more ready</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">to embrace some of the non work aspects</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.780" end="00:26:49.430" style="s2">of their identity in part because of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:51.290" style="s2">cultural load that is placed on</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.430" end="00:26:53.540" style="s2">different types of yeah but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.290" end="00:26:55.670" style="s2">think they&#39;re facing a big one coming up</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.540" end="00:26:59.540" style="s2">which is that you&#39;re gonna have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.670" end="00:27:02.120" style="s2">cohort of millennial females who pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.540" end="00:27:04.190" style="s2">much would would love to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.120" end="00:27:06.260" style="s2">situation with meaningful work but also</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.190" end="00:27:09.230" style="s2">with a family raising children of their</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:12.520" style="s2">own and there&#39;s first of all it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.230" end="00:27:15.170" style="s2">necessarily a supply of guys who can</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.520" end="00:27:16.910" style="s2">rise to that I mean you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.170" end="00:27:18.670" style="s2">have to be traditional households but a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.910" end="00:27:20.900" style="s2">lot of it is gonna be male female</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.670" end="00:27:21.890" style="s2">breadwinner somebody stays at home it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.900" end="00:27:23.330" style="s2">might be the woman who&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.890" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">workforce might be the guy staying home</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.330" end="00:27:28.550" style="s2">whatever the fact is a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:32.030" style="s2">families aren&#39;t going to form because</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.550" end="00:27:33.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not in a position to say I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.030" end="00:27:36.650" style="s2">afford a 30-year mortgage I can see</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.860" end="00:27:38.180" style="s2">enough stability in my future I can and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.650" end="00:27:39.830" style="s2">and that that&#39;s part of the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.180" end="00:27:42.910" style="s2">that these challenges face us all in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.830" end="00:27:45.410" style="s2">different ways and it&#39;s really to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.910" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">counterproductive to disastrous to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.410" end="00:27:49.190" style="s2">single out a particular subset ups and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:53.060" style="s2">be like hey you&#39;ve got it wrong you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.190" end="00:27:55.250" style="s2">okay you know that&#39;s a legitimate you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.060" end="00:27:59.900" style="s2">know like thing to be upset about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.250" end="00:28:02.780" style="s2">is not I mean like if if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.900" end="00:28:05.510" style="s2">struggling like it ends up reaching</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.780" end="00:28:07.070" style="s2">different groups in different ways right</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.510" end="00:28:11.630" style="s2">and and you can&#39;t say it&#39;s like oh your</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.070" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">struggles are somehow more valid than</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.630" end="00:28:17.960" style="s2">others so just to wrap around this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:19.910" style="s2">thought so I think that the division of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.960" end="00:28:24.590" style="s2">our identities into like work and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.910" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">non-work right it&#39;s one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.590" end="00:28:31.940" style="s2">things we have to overcome and by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">numbers if you lose your job and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.940" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">a man you tend to have relatively</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.990" end="00:28:43.610" style="s2">self-destructive patterns of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.890" end="00:28:46.580" style="s2">manifest relatively consistently and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.610" end="00:28:48.260" style="s2">quickly we&#39;re unemployed men volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.580" end="00:28:49.789" style="s2">less than employed men despite having</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.260" end="00:28:52.779" style="s2">much more free time as</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.789" end="00:28:55.580" style="s2">example substance abuse tends to go up</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.779" end="00:28:57.889" style="s2">in very self-destructive behaviors a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.580" end="00:29:01.549" style="s2">of time spent on the computer goes up</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.889" end="00:29:05.419" style="s2">which so that&#39;s a combination of gaming</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.549" end="00:29:06.830" style="s2">and some other things and worn and porn</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.419" end="00:29:08.509" style="s2">I&#39;m sure is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.830" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">you know I admit didn&#39;t I mean I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.509" end="00:29:13.999" style="s2">implied it but was thinking you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:15.259" style="s2">this is a free radio station effectively</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.999" end="00:29:16.549" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna be able to say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.259" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.549" end="00:29:23.349" style="s2">deranging us we don&#39;t know what its</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:26.509" style="s2">effects are ya know so and that women</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.349" end="00:29:29.299" style="s2">have struggles obviously but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.509" end="00:29:32.389" style="s2">struggles take a different form in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.299" end="00:29:36.229" style="s2">of and the numbers show that women are</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.389" end="00:29:38.210" style="s2">more adaptable to non work idleness</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.229" end="00:29:39.889" style="s2">right that they will not show the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.210" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">patterns of self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.889" end="00:29:43.669" style="s2">that men do now of course women</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:46.429" style="s2">obviously you know hate to be unemployed</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.669" end="00:29:48.169" style="s2">but the thing that I joke about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.429" end="00:29:50.389" style="s2">sort of true is that women however are</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.169" end="00:29:53.539" style="s2">never truly idle in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.389" end="00:29:56.869" style="s2">always find like well this is a treat</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.539" end="00:29:58.639" style="s2">like ways to be productive contributors</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.869" end="00:30:00.590" style="s2">in a way that so many were struggle</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.639" end="00:30:03.080" style="s2">examine where you&#39;re working for your</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.590" end="00:30:06.200" style="s2">family taking care of elderly parents</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.080" end="00:30:09.139" style="s2">your kids somebody else&#39;s kids these</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.200" end="00:30:10.909" style="s2">things are part of the fabric of civil</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.139" end="00:30:13.340" style="s2">society one of the questions I have is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.909" end="00:30:15.259" style="s2">should we talk about coming up with some</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.340" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">new financial products that get women</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.259" end="00:30:18.529" style="s2">the money they need during the period of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:20.359" style="s2">their life</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.529" end="00:30:23.299" style="s2">when they might need extra help in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.359" end="00:30:25.700" style="s2">house when they when the the binds that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.299" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">come from caring for elderly parents or</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:29.960" style="s2">children are starting to knock them out</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:33.159" style="s2">of the workforce and trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.960" end="00:30:37.849" style="s2">out how to make some kind of creative</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.159" end="00:30:39.109" style="s2">structure to help shift the burdens to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.849" end="00:30:40.309" style="s2">times of their life when they can better</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.109" end="00:30:43.070" style="s2">afford it what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.309" end="00:30:45.229" style="s2">yeah so just to sort of show the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.070" end="00:30:47.090" style="s2">side of the coin so men volunteered less</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.229" end="00:30:48.229" style="s2">with their unemployed than employed even</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.090" end="00:30:51.739" style="s2">though that doesn&#39;t make any sense in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.229" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">terms of their free time women show</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.739" end="00:30:56.509" style="s2">higher rates of volunteers have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:59.299" style="s2">going back to school when they have more</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.509" end="00:31:01.249" style="s2">more time so it&#39;s just that the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.299" end="00:31:02.750" style="s2">show clear patterns of like different</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.249" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">responses to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.750" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">you non-work-related</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:12.230" style="s2">time or idleness but I&#39;m with you in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:16.070" style="s2">fact that right now trying to map</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.230" end="00:31:18.560" style="s2">everyone&#39;s economic prospects to the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.070" end="00:31:23.450" style="s2">market the markets valuation of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.560" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">wages right has all sorts of distorting</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.450" end="00:31:28.340" style="s2">effects and what you&#39;re suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.690" end="00:31:29.960" style="s2">we should just start putting with money</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.340" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">into people&#39;s hands at various points in</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.960" end="00:31:34.370" style="s2">their lives I mean that&#39;s really one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:36.920" style="s2">the underpinnings of the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.370" end="00:31:38.180" style="s2">dividend you know my part of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.920" end="00:31:41.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like you put a thousand bucks a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:44.030" style="s2">month into people&#39;s hands and then that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.630" end="00:31:46.520" style="s2">would allow us all to make different</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.030" end="00:31:50.180" style="s2">types of decisions really from almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.520" end="00:31:52.910" style="s2">day one of our adulthood yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.180" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">all right let&#39;s try a few other things</p>

<p begin="00:31:58.810" end="00:32:05.540" style="s2">demographers demographers are sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.580" end="00:32:07.670" style="s2">asked tell me some group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.540" end="00:32:09.860" style="s2">we don&#39;t know about as a voting bloc</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.670" end="00:32:12.140" style="s2">that nobody&#39;s figured out how to speak</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.860" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">to and I think I have a couple of these</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.160" end="00:32:28.790" style="s2">moms was one from years past or exurbs</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:29.390" style="s2">between rural and suburbs where people</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.790" end="00:32:31.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize that there were</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.390" end="00:32:33.110" style="s2">intermediate places so here&#39;s one that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.400" end="00:32:36.770" style="s2">think is huge that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.110" end="00:32:39.170" style="s2">identified parents of super smart kids</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.770" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">that have some kind of a learning</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.170" end="00:32:44.630" style="s2">difference that causes them to wildly</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:46.340" style="s2">underperform in school this is something</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.630" end="00:32:48.500" style="s2">that makes me crazy because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.340" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">all over once you start seeing it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.500" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">see it everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:53.780" style="s2">parents are tearing their hair out you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">know teachers can&#39;t handle the kid nope</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.780" end="00:33:00.050" style="s2">and there&#39;s just this maddening loss of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.740" end="00:33:01.820" style="s2">human brilliance that is flushed down</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.050" end="00:33:03.350" style="s2">the toilet have you come up with a name</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.820" end="00:33:07.790" style="s2">for this group</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.350" end="00:33:11.060" style="s2">well I often refer to these as kids with</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.790" end="00:33:12.800" style="s2">learning superpowers and I like I talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.060" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">about teaching disabilities which is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.800" end="00:33:18.130" style="s2">more dangerous version of this that be</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2">people don&#39;t fit into the notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.130" end="00:33:21.880" style="s2">can be educated by one teacher teaching</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.350" end="00:33:26.110" style="s2">a room of 30 people to make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.880" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">economics work my belief is that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.110" end="00:33:30.490" style="s2">I&#39;ll come up with a name for it for you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:32.920" style="s2">but I want to talk to all of the parents</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.610" end="00:33:43.180" style="s2">one speak to it</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.440" end="00:34:16.510" style="s2">facts show that it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.000" end="00:34:19.690" style="s2">commonplace and at this point I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.510" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">most American families have someone</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">certainly the case that a lot of us have</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.319" end="00:35:53.140" style="s2">the idea that we almost don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.990" end="00:36:33.460" style="s2">think is really important now I know</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.280" end="00:36:35.829" style="s2">that you are the child of immigrants and</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.940" end="00:36:51.490" style="s2">jingoistic and I think that that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:53.559" style="s2">but I also think that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.490" end="00:36:56.170" style="s2">recognize that there is a story about</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.170" end="00:37:01.660" style="s2">ugly which is how Americans have used</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.490" end="00:38:33.950" style="s2">angry about the immigrants this is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:36.200" style="s2">thing because because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.950" end="00:38:37.610" style="s2">like you said it&#39;s like you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.200" end="00:38:39.770" style="s2">ways someone can have a very legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.610" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">grievance right the fact that there have</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.770" end="00:38:45.800" style="s2">been these instruments of a wealth</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:48.890" style="s2">transfer that have been imported into</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.800" end="00:38:52.810" style="s2">our midst so I call these the Americans</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.890" end="00:38:56.030" style="s2">who redistribute our wealth immigrant</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.810" end="00:38:57.980" style="s2">reproduce puppy dogs to redistribute our</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.030" end="00:39:00.140" style="s2">wealth they&#39;d use puppy dogs because</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.980" end="00:39:02.270" style="s2">nobody can be against puppies right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.140" end="00:39:04.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very cynical use of the Statue</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.270" end="00:39:05.960" style="s2">of Liberty but something is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.040" end="00:39:07.010" style="s2">difficult to talk about but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.960" end="00:39:09.500" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.010" end="00:39:12.410" style="s2">for a while because I think that I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.500" end="00:39:14.390" style="s2">so far in the Zen affiliate category</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.410" end="00:39:16.190" style="s2">it would be comical if somebody decided</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.390" end="00:39:17.840" style="s2">I actually had a problem so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.190" end="00:39:20.360" style="s2">bold and I haven&#39;t really had the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.840" end="00:39:21.740" style="s2">problem but most Americans feel very</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.360" end="00:39:23.510" style="s2">uncomfortable talking about immigration</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.740" end="00:39:25.400" style="s2">because they have two different feelings</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.510" end="00:39:26.870" style="s2">they one have a really good feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:28.460" style="s2">about the person that they know who</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.870" end="00:39:30.680" style="s2">happened to come from Uganda or India</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.460" end="00:39:32.360" style="s2">and they have the sense that something</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.680" end="00:39:33.850" style="s2">is wrong with this story we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.360" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">have to disentangle it and restore</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.850" end="00:39:38.510" style="s2">something that makes us feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.930" end="00:39:39.590" style="s2">it rather than uncomfortable I agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.510" end="00:39:43.790" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.590" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">yeah and you know I think I may be able</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.790" end="00:39:47.660" style="s2">to help in this regard I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:49.070" style="s2">perfectly positioned for this but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.660" end="00:39:53.480" style="s2">know part I&#39;m the son of immigrants who</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.070" end="00:39:55.160" style="s2">loves this country loves that immigrants</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.480" end="00:39:56.600" style="s2">have been incredible source of dynamism</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.160" end="00:40:00.470" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.600" end="00:40:03.170" style="s2">I you know you can&#39;t have open borders</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.470" end="00:40:04.670" style="s2">and unrestricted immigration I</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.170" end="00:40:08.930" style="s2">understand the sentiment where people</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.670" end="00:40:11.390" style="s2">are struggling with the fact that our</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.930" end="00:40:12.940" style="s2">country has brought many people in</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.390" end="00:40:19.610" style="s2">either intentionally or unintentionally</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.940" end="00:40:22.250" style="s2">in ways that are changing our economy</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.610" end="00:40:27.560" style="s2">and society in ways that in like some</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.250" end="00:40:29.120" style="s2">people have in legitimate problems with</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.560" end="00:40:31.400" style="s2">I think we need to be able to have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.120" end="00:40:34.460" style="s2">open conversation about difficult topics</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.400" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2">around this and pull them apart and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.460" end="00:40:38.750" style="s2">fact is we need we need people to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:40.760" style="s2">comfortable that it&#39;s okay to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.750" end="00:40:42.710" style="s2">uncomfortable as long as you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.760" end="00:40:45.380" style="s2">to explore them at the current president</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.710" end="00:40:47.750" style="s2">from my money gets way too close to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.380" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">jingoistic sentiments yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.750" end="00:40:51.710" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the natural reactions is</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:53.480" style="s2">that if the current president says one</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.710" end="00:40:54.770" style="s2">thing then you know the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.480" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">do is say the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.770" end="00:40:58.940" style="s2">but then the nuance gets lost and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:01.010" style="s2">unfortunately we end up falling into</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.940" end="00:41:03.380" style="s2">that&#39;s why you see authorized camps we</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.010" end="00:41:05.270" style="s2">have it&#39;s so important not only to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.380" end="00:41:09.830" style="s2">defeat the current president but also to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.270" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">defeat the kleptocratic center of of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.830" end="00:41:15.650" style="s2">own party as well as the regressive left</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.430" end="00:41:18.320" style="s2">that proposes as the progressive rep</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.650" end="00:41:21.620" style="s2">left and then to take care of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.320" end="00:41:24.170" style="s2">constituents that are currently all over</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.620" end="00:41:25.340" style="s2">the spectrum in a new world and one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.170" end="00:41:27.980" style="s2">the things I love about your slogan</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.340" end="00:41:30.170" style="s2">which is not left or right but forward</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.980" end="00:41:32.120" style="s2">right yes that&#39;s the slogan yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.170" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">that that thing is is that it is moot</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.120" end="00:41:35.870" style="s2">it&#39;s a question it also happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:37.610" style="s2">the truth it&#39;s not a static I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.870" end="00:41:40.970" style="s2">moving out of flatland like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.610" end="00:41:42.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve been given this smorgasbord of bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.970" end="00:41:44.090" style="s2">options and just say hey I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.740" end="00:41:46.190" style="s2">want to dine from there I think these</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.090" end="00:41:48.650" style="s2">things are available off menu do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.190" end="00:41:51.410" style="s2">mind if I if I you know like for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.650" end="00:41:52.970" style="s2">Starbucks I think will sell you a short</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.410" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">cup of coffee but they won&#39;t put it on</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.970" end="00:41:56.390" style="s2">the menu you have to know that to ask</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">for it so I like to think of you as the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.390" end="00:41:59.360" style="s2">guy who somehow knows that there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:02.030" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t on the menu I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.360" end="00:42:05.030" style="s2">animal-style it in and out</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.030" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">I&#39;m Andrew yeah his animal style</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.030" end="00:42:11.660" style="s2">let me get me man I I agree that I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:13.490" style="s2">change the political conversation in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.660" end="00:42:16.130" style="s2">way that many Americans find very</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.490" end="00:42:18.260" style="s2">exciting and productive because 25% of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.130" end="00:42:19.790" style="s2">Americans are politically disengaged</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.260" end="00:42:22.660" style="s2">including I&#39;m sure some people watching</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.790" end="00:42:24.860" style="s2">this and I believe it&#39;s up to 48%</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.660" end="00:42:27.140" style="s2">self-identify as independent which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.860" end="00:42:29.870" style="s2">almost twice what identify as other</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.870" end="00:42:34.670" style="s2">can&#39;t stand my own party but my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:38.180" style="s2">is I have to stay there and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.670" end="00:42:40.490" style="s2">we&#39;re out of control in order to save</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.180" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">the structure because I&#39;d like you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.490" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">well the two-party system I mean I agree</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:45.170" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m why I&#39;m running as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.120" style="s2">Democrat in part it&#39;s like well you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.170" end="00:42:49.820" style="s2">these two parties maybe you can turn one</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.120" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">of them into like a highly functioning</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.820" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">party with great ideas in the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:56.390" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s like an easier solution</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:58.490" style="s2">than what I really want to do is I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.390" end="00:43:00.320" style="s2">to reach I want the insurgency that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.490" end="00:43:03.020" style="s2">and I have been sort of a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.320" end="00:43:06.620" style="s2">loose collection of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.020" end="00:43:08.990" style="s2">thinking completely off the menu to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.620" end="00:43:11.930" style="s2">start retaking our institutions we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.990" end="00:43:15.170" style="s2">always had heterodox people of high</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.400" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">as soon as you get the institutional</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.870" end="00:44:44.540" style="s2">recognition that there should be space</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.900" end="00:44:48.110" style="s2">for remorse and redemption this is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.540" end="00:44:49.190" style="s2">makes so much of the intolerant left</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.110" end="00:44:51.530" style="s2">feel cult-like</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.190" end="00:44:53.600" style="s2">and I thought what you were doing was</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.530" end="00:44:55.670" style="s2">you were showing the best aspects of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.600" end="00:44:57.500" style="s2">truly compassionate left I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.670" end="00:44:59.870" style="s2">be a human being you know like you look</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.500" end="00:45:03.260" style="s2">at him being like well like the is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.870" end="00:45:06.320" style="s2">a job losing a fence but then the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.260" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">that NBC ended up firing him was</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.320" end="00:45:10.550" style="s2">entirely consistent with our corporate</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.230" style="s2">incentives because if you look at it say</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.550" end="00:45:13.970" style="s2">like well is this person that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.230" end="00:45:16.130" style="s2">invested a lot in that some revenue</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.970" end="00:45:17.330" style="s2">generator for us no because you hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.130" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">even worked for one day</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.330" end="00:45:22.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like our corporate incentives to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">can him and thus like you know put an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.340" end="00:45:27.800" style="s2">end to any controversy or advertisers or</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:29.510" style="s2">whatnot that we be troubled by it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.800" end="00:45:30.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s like so if you&#39;d asked me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:31.910" style="s2">like hey do you think he&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.530" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">fired I mean like yeah he&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.910" end="00:45:34.130" style="s2">certainly gonna be fired because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:35.450" style="s2">what the corporate incentives well I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.130" end="00:45:37.220" style="s2">understand that so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.450" end="00:45:39.020" style="s2">that I&#39;m really interested in doing but</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.220" end="00:45:43.580" style="s2">I still made me sad like I was like hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.020" end="00:45:45.320" style="s2">this would be unusually human and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.580" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">forgiving if they decided to well they</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.320" end="00:45:49.130" style="s2">lost a teachable moment because one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.600" end="00:45:52.730" style="s2">the things that&#39;s going on is that so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.130" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">much of the information economy is very</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.730" end="00:45:56.210" style="s2">very marginal in the sense that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.470" end="00:46:00.500" style="s2">almost producing a public good so for</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.210" end="00:46:02.180" style="s2">example I slap ads on my podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.500" end="00:46:03.560" style="s2">when I start my sponsors now what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.180" end="00:46:05.240" style="s2">trying well what I&#39;m trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.560" end="00:46:07.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried two new models one of which</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.240" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">I&#39;m calling reverse sponsorship where I</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.610" end="00:46:11.870" style="s2">shout out some great company which</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:13.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.870" end="00:46:15.710" style="s2">something positive and maybe they become</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.780" end="00:46:18.080" style="s2">sponsors maybe they don&#39;t but the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.710" end="00:46:20.060" style="s2">one is risk vertices where people get to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.080" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">know me over long periods of time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.060" end="00:46:24.740" style="s2">the hope is that you&#39;re gonna say look</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:26.870" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna catch me being horrible</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.740" end="00:46:28.490" style="s2">and bigoted in all of these things but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.870" end="00:46:29.180" style="s2">might say something dangerous like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.490" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.180" end="00:46:33.290" style="s2">just said about immigration and will you</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">make sure that you will not run away</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.290" end="00:46:36.829" style="s2">from me</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:38.420" style="s2">during the period where the mob descends</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.829" end="00:46:40.369" style="s2">and the frenzy is that it&#39;s worse now</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.420" end="00:46:42.950" style="s2">right because if we don&#39;t fix the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.369" end="00:46:44.660" style="s2">economic models we can&#39;t have deeper</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.950" end="00:46:46.369" style="s2">discussions because everybody&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.660" end="00:46:48.290" style="s2">run away at the first sight of trouble</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.369" end="00:46:50.690" style="s2">and so part of what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.290" end="00:46:53.150" style="s2">ultimately with the advertising is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.690" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">pirate radio pre advertising what do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.150" end="00:46:57.650" style="s2">think I mean I love it&#39;s like leave it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:59.210" style="s2">to you to try and solve that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.650" end="00:47:01.130" style="s2">problem or I got some other things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.210" end="00:47:03.380" style="s2">I want to talk about is demographics</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.130" end="00:47:06.680" style="s2">oh yeah please okay so so so let me</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.380" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">first say I am a parent of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.680" end="00:47:12.349" style="s2">neurologically atypical young person I</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">agree with you that I think that many of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.349" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">people have a different perspective are</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">going to end up being contributors and</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:21.109" style="s2">in highly distinctive ways I will say</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">that even kids who are not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.109" end="00:47:26.150" style="s2">contributors in a highly distinctive way</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:30.680" style="s2">still deserve schools that can support</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.150" end="00:47:32.510" style="s2">and accommodate them and that to me</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.680" end="00:47:34.940" style="s2">these kids are like the shorthand I use</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.510" end="00:47:38.059" style="s2">is that their spiky you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.940" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">you have very high capacities in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.059" end="00:47:41.540" style="s2">respects or a different point of view</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:44.119" style="s2">and then real challenges in other</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.540" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">respect and so if I send you into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.119" end="00:47:48.950" style="s2">social environment where there are 30</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">kids for one teacher you&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.950" end="00:47:54.260" style="s2">terrible terrible time you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:56.150" style="s2">that&#39;s 100% predictable and so if then</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.260" end="00:47:59.210" style="s2">you have like a critical mass of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.150" end="00:48:00.890" style="s2">that resemble this then you should try</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.210" end="00:48:04.430" style="s2">and design an institution that takes</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.890" end="00:48:06.140" style="s2">that into account and I feel so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.430" end="00:48:07.670" style="s2">for families that struggle with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.140" end="00:48:09.770" style="s2">like you struggle with it sounds like oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.670" end="00:48:12.109" style="s2">absolutely experiencing it I am strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.770" end="00:48:14.390" style="s2">with it and and you and Pia you know me</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.109" end="00:48:17.450" style="s2">and Evelyn like we have an unusual level</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.390" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">of ability to try and you know manage</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.450" end="00:48:23.869" style="s2">situation and I meet single moms around</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">the country who have you know autistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.869" end="00:48:28.309" style="s2">or neurologically typical kids and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">don&#39;t have the means and they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.309" end="00:48:32.450" style="s2">live in a part of the country that does</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:35.690" style="s2">not have like a lot of resources in</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.450" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">place for kids that are different and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.690" end="00:48:39.260" style="s2">breaks my heart like it the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:40.760" style="s2">there are all of these kids that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:41.930" style="s2">heading into these schools that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.760" end="00:48:44.300" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.930" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">you know more than low-grade psychic</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.300" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">beatings oh my god this is why I leave</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:51.020" style="s2">my my DM is open on Twitter and this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">one of the number one things I do it for</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.020" end="00:48:53.690" style="s2">is people write to me and they say I</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.150" style="s2">know you&#39;re really busy but I just want</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.690" end="00:48:58.040" style="s2">to tell you nobody had ever spoken to my</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.150" end="00:49:00.530" style="s2">situation you&#39;re proud of something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.040" end="00:49:01.970" style="s2">always ashamed of and I guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.530" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">I&#39;m not the first presidential candidate</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.970" end="00:49:05.000" style="s2">with autism in the family yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:09.410" style="s2">fact that on the first talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.000" end="00:49:11.840" style="s2">is to me long overdue and ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.410" end="00:49:13.190" style="s2">a man and you know and I get I get some</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.840" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">of the same messages that you get but</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.190" end="00:49:17.930" style="s2">you know like I want to actually try and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:19.430" style="s2">solve the problem for those families I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.930" end="00:49:21.320" style="s2">mean it makes me feel glad that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.430" end="00:49:22.610" style="s2">feel spoken to and that they realize not</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.320" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">the only ones going through I want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.610" end="00:49:26.780" style="s2">see I want to see more money going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:29.780" style="s2">figure out how do we diversify the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.780" end="00:49:32.660" style="s2">classroom of the future yeah so that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.780" end="00:49:34.760" style="s2">load isn&#39;t borne by people who don&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.660" end="00:49:37.310" style="s2">the economics of the teaching model yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.760" end="00:49:39.290" style="s2">and part of it is that that we regard</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.310" end="00:49:41.600" style="s2">the education of our kids is a cost and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.290" end="00:49:43.940" style="s2">so then the city then is like well I</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.600" end="00:49:47.600" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to have like a teacher for</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.940" end="00:49:49.250" style="s2">you&#39;re not a typical kid and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.600" end="00:49:51.580" style="s2">have to do is talk about inverting the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.250" end="00:49:54.020" style="s2">model is you have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.580" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">education of our children as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.020" end="00:49:59.480" style="s2">investment and then you say what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:02.020" style="s2">like these kids require you know like</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.480" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">X&amp;Y then we should make that investment</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.020" end="00:50:06.950" style="s2">with the certainty and I share your</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.460" style="s2">confidence in this that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.950" end="00:50:13.220" style="s2">couple of those kids do something highly</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.460" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">atypical and remarkable then that pays</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.220" end="00:50:24.410" style="s2">for whatever support or German I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:26.900" style="s2">had a very well-known professor revealed</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.410" end="00:50:29.540" style="s2">to me that he couldn&#39;t read papers in</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.900" end="00:50:31.340" style="s2">his field I just can&#39;t read you know any</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.540" end="00:50:34.550" style="s2">and he has to figure out what the paper</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.340" end="00:50:38.830" style="s2">is likely to be saying there is such a</p>

<p begin="00:50:38.830" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">and this is the demon this is the demon</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.630" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">that we have to slay yes anyways is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:51.560" style="s2">the negative externalities are not being</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:53.450" style="s2">encompassed within the budgets of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.560" end="00:50:55.500" style="s2">various institutions very well so but</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.450" end="00:50:58.170" style="s2">but then also where for</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.500" end="00:51:02.130" style="s2">going all of the potential positive</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.170" end="00:51:05.400" style="s2">value creation or generation from proper</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.130" end="00:51:06.750" style="s2">investment in our human capital and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.400" end="00:51:08.100" style="s2">another dimension too and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.750" end="00:51:09.630" style="s2">another here nor there but I was just</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.100" end="00:51:11.970" style="s2">with Dean came in and in New Hampshire</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.630" end="00:51:13.410" style="s2">and he was talking about how the FDA is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.970" end="00:51:15.210" style="s2">like all their incentives are just to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.410" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">like regulate the shit out of anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.210" end="00:51:18.810" style="s2">and then I said to him I was like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:21.360" style="s2">know what they should start measuring is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.810" end="00:51:24.450" style="s2">the foregone utility of keeping</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.360" end="00:51:25.530" style="s2">something away from from people like if</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.450" end="00:51:27.450" style="s2">you had something and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.530" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">African like cost of the regulation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.450" end="00:51:30.300" style="s2">he had like so he had like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:32.520" style="s2">prosthetic limb that he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.300" end="00:51:33.840" style="s2">give to vets and the FDA was making it</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.520" end="00:51:36.080" style="s2">really hard for him to do so he was like</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.840" end="00:51:40.350" style="s2">are you kidding me I&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.080" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">limbs Tibet save it amputated and so by</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.350" end="00:51:44.490" style="s2">you&#39;re making it hard for me to do so</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:47.190" style="s2">like you multiply like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.490" end="00:51:48.900" style="s2">limbless vets who aren&#39;t getting a limb</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.190" end="00:51:51.300" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like so if you had</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.900" end="00:51:53.610" style="s2">that as like an actual measurement for</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.300" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">the FDA it&#39;s like you need to have these</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.610" end="00:51:57.240" style="s2">companies internalize the negative</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">externalities of things like pollution</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.240" end="00:52:01.290" style="s2">and the rest of it but you almost need</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:03.900" style="s2">like our institutions like our schools</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.290" end="00:52:06.570" style="s2">and our regulatory agencies to start</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.900" end="00:52:10.430" style="s2">trying to somehow capture the potential</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.570" end="00:52:12.810" style="s2">gains from investing in our kids or</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.430" end="00:52:15.360" style="s2">allowing a certain innovation into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.810" end="00:52:16.770" style="s2">market like that the the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.360" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">are that our measurements are really</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.770" end="00:52:26.040" style="s2">primitive and it ends up and you end up</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:28.410" style="s2">with binary incentives where you lose a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.040" end="00:52:29.610" style="s2">lot of the value and so you end up being</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.410" end="00:52:31.980" style="s2">like hey don&#39;t have a teacher for your</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.610" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">kid so your kids gonna you know just end</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.980" end="00:52:37.830" style="s2">up sidelined what well you know in</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:40.530" style="s2">sidelined is like a euphemistic way for</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.830" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">saying destroyed I know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.530" end="00:52:44.280" style="s2">things I wanted to do at some point I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:45.840" style="s2">actually ended up talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.280" end="00:52:49.650" style="s2">Heritage Foundation of all people about</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.840" end="00:52:50.970" style="s2">this was the idea of national interest</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.650" end="00:52:53.790" style="s2">waivers so that we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.970" end="00:52:56.100" style="s2">skunkworks with very light regulation</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.790" end="00:52:59.850" style="s2">hanging off the side of every large</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.100" end="00:53:01.710" style="s2">company and the idea that you would put</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.850" end="00:53:03.600" style="s2">some portion of a company you could put</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.710" end="00:53:05.610" style="s2">some portion of a company outside where</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.600" end="00:53:07.350" style="s2">the rules were effectively different</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.610" end="00:53:09.000" style="s2">because you needed people to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.350" end="00:53:11.360" style="s2">massive risks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.000" end="00:53:13.950" style="s2">to be able to move super fast to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.360" end="00:53:15.570" style="s2">dealing with highly non neurotypical</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.950" end="00:53:16.980" style="s2">people and this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.570" end="00:53:19.110" style="s2">that drives me nuts about the political</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.980" end="00:53:21.270" style="s2">conversation is like you get like they</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.110" end="00:53:22.830" style="s2">get like yelled at for a particular it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.270" end="00:53:24.480" style="s2">like oh you made a mistake but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.830" end="00:53:26.250" style="s2">you kind of need to have an environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.480" end="00:53:27.870" style="s2">where you&#39;re going to accept a certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.250" end="00:53:29.940" style="s2">level of mistakes particularly when</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.870" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.940" end="00:53:33.690" style="s2">society-wide investments where like of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:36.210" style="s2">course you can&#39;t get that stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.690" end="00:53:37.800" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s like and that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.210" end="00:53:40.050" style="s2">problem is that the political incentives</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.800" end="00:53:42.900" style="s2">are for everyone to try and avoid like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.050" end="00:53:44.370" style="s2">negative headline or something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.900" end="00:53:46.470" style="s2">that&#39;s look a lot of us are very</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.370" end="00:53:49.250" style="s2">disagreeable very difficult to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.470" end="00:53:52.470" style="s2">and you know I saw you pick up</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.250" end="00:53:55.620" style="s2">endorsements from people like Elon Musk</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.470" end="00:53:58.110" style="s2">you know which is is then I hear his</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.620" end="00:53:59.670" style="s2">personal life being criticized like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.110" end="00:54:02.190" style="s2">don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.670" end="00:54:04.590" style="s2">this guy is responsible for everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.190" end="00:54:07.500" style="s2">this specie how much it V right how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.590" end="00:54:09.570" style="s2">innovation if he&#39;s got a few four balls</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.500" end="00:54:11.970" style="s2">let&#39;s give him some privacy let him be</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.570" end="00:54:14.250" style="s2">in peace and just recognize that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.970" end="00:54:17.160" style="s2">getting an unbelievable deal and yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.250" end="00:54:18.150" style="s2">this desire to somehow stamp out</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.160" end="00:54:21.210" style="s2">outliers</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.150" end="00:54:24.210" style="s2">I mean outliers are essential to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.210" end="00:54:26.250" style="s2">American project yes I could not agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.210" end="00:54:28.980" style="s2">more and and you know I I&#39;d consider</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.250" end="00:54:34.230" style="s2">myself it&#39;s pretty funny Eric cuz I you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.980" end="00:54:40.350" style="s2">know I think I had in many ways like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.230" end="00:54:41.990" style="s2">highly conventional upbringing that help</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.350" end="00:54:46.080" style="s2">like I feel like I&#39;m sort of a hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.990" end="00:54:49.310" style="s2">where to the extent that I was highly</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.080" end="00:54:53.090" style="s2">contrarian or dissimilar that&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.310" end="00:54:56.790" style="s2">you know I came up through a series of</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.090" end="00:54:59.400" style="s2">institutions in an era where you know I</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.790" end="00:55:01.730" style="s2">think I learned to adapt but then I look</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.400" end="00:55:06.510" style="s2">at my boys and I think to myself that</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.730" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">you know that that their way of life is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.510" end="00:55:09.480" style="s2">going to be very very different than</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:11.010" style="s2">mine I&#39;m sure yours too because we came</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.480" end="00:55:12.120" style="s2">of age in a different era well this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.010" end="00:55:13.860" style="s2">true I mean I was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.120" end="00:55:16.830" style="s2">this actually with Bret Easton Ellis</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.860" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">sitting in that chair that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.830" end="00:55:22.410" style="s2">grew up as part of this free-range world</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:24.210" style="s2">largely before Etan Patz got kidnapped</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.410" end="00:55:27.960" style="s2">the milk carton kids changed everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.210" end="00:55:29.549" style="s2">I worry about the sort of we were too</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.960" end="00:55:31.140" style="s2">free-range and these kids are too</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.549" end="00:55:32.910" style="s2">sheltered that we have to find some new</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.140" end="00:55:35.250" style="s2">it makes but I want to get to another</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.910" end="00:55:36.150" style="s2">give me one more demographic okay yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.250" end="00:55:39.150" style="s2">let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.150" end="00:55:42.510" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll close it out I want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.150" end="00:55:45.240" style="s2">talk about something which really makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.510" end="00:55:48.599" style="s2">me angry and excited I think that</p>

<p begin="00:58:30.770" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">and this is something that the</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:40.799" style="s2">leader in where that said you know what</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.859" end="00:58:43.500" style="s2">we can lay the foundation and create</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.799" end="00:58:46.500" style="s2">paths for people to be able to do basic</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.500" end="00:58:48.599" style="s2">research the benefits of which will be</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.599" end="00:58:52.700" style="s2">materialize for decades but it&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.789" end="00:58:54.869" style="s2">to what we&#39;re talking about with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.700" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">neurologically atypical kids is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.869" end="00:59:00.630" style="s2">like a few of them pay off and then the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">payoff can be unfathomably significant</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.630" end="00:59:06.210" style="s2">what we call this long vol investing in</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:08.039" style="s2">hedge fund land where most things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.210" end="00:59:11.010" style="s2">work out but a few that do pay for all</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.039" end="00:59:14.010" style="s2">of the losers yep yeah and and right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.010" end="00:59:16.500" style="s2">the the yeah that to me this is a role</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.010" end="00:59:19.109" style="s2">where historically the government has</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.500" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">led and you need a government willing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.109" end="00:59:26.849" style="s2">make long-term sustained investments</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:28.470" style="s2">that may only pay off way down the road</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.849" end="00:59:30.119" style="s2">and may not pay off but you still need</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.470" end="00:59:32.190" style="s2">to be able to make them well so you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.119" end="00:59:35.609" style="s2">the the other weird part of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.190" end="00:59:38.579" style="s2">by using our own people and letting in</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.609" end="00:59:41.339" style="s2">particular China know that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.579" end="00:59:43.470" style="s2">operate a relatively totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.339" end="00:59:45.690" style="s2">government over there and have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.470" end="00:59:47.910" style="s2">benefit of freedom over here with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.690" end="00:59:49.290" style="s2">pipeline for all of our innovations to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.910" end="00:59:52.440" style="s2">immediately go back</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.290" end="00:59:55.560" style="s2">over there China needs to be induced in</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.440" end="00:59:57.600" style="s2">some sense to understand that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.560" end="00:59:59.250" style="s2">get by without giving their people</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.600" end="01:00:01.320" style="s2">freedom and what they&#39;re right now doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.250" end="01:00:03.210" style="s2">is is that they&#39;re using our freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.320" end="01:00:05.640" style="s2">a periscope by which they can see</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.210" end="01:00:07.620" style="s2">everything that we&#39;re doing and if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.640" end="01:00:09.210" style="s2">actually cut that off I know that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.620" end="01:00:11.430" style="s2">universities are gonna scream bloody</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.210" end="01:00:13.860" style="s2">murder but what&#39;s gonna happen is China</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.430" end="01:00:16.500" style="s2">is gonna have to start investing in its</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.860" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">the right of its own people to give the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.500" end="01:00:22.260" style="s2">middle finger because irreverence is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:24.060" style="s2">secret of American ingenuity yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.260" end="01:00:26.580" style="s2">you know that this reminds me of a joke</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.060" end="01:00:29.910" style="s2">that they told artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.580" end="01:00:32.750" style="s2">which is how far behind is China than</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.910" end="01:00:35.340" style="s2">the US and AI and the answer is 12 hours</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.750" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">means they you know obviously they wake</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.340" end="01:00:39.990" style="s2">up and then they see what we did I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">tell you how fantastic it is they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.990" end="01:00:44.070" style="s2">you come into the studio you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.260" style="s2">off of this big rally in MacArthur Park</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.070" end="01:00:48.270" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome anytime to come back I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.260" end="01:00:51.180" style="s2">love to continue the conversation is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.270" end="01:00:52.560" style="s2">ban this this feels to me like half a</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.180" end="01:00:54.690" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re gonna have to have</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.560" end="01:00:57.210" style="s2">the second half at some other time so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.690" end="01:00:59.460" style="s2">you enjoyed this convo let Eric know and</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.210" end="01:01:00.810" style="s2">then hopefully I&#39;ll have me back and if</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.460" end="01:01:02.790" style="s2">you&#39;d like to join the yangyang you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.810" end="01:01:05.460" style="s2">should know we are a very very cheap</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.790" end="01:01:08.760" style="s2">gang to join right well our average</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.460" end="01:01:10.170" style="s2">donation is only $25 so our fans are</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.760" end="01:01:11.610" style="s2">even cheaper than Bernie&#39;s which no one</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.170" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">even knew could be a thing in politics</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.610" end="01:01:16.670" style="s2">but here it is but you get $25 times</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:19.080" style="s2">enough people and you end up putting up</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.670" end="01:01:20.940" style="s2">very very big numbers and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.080" end="01:01:24.120" style="s2">like we&#39;re already into the eight digits</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.940" end="01:01:26.550" style="s2">as a campaign and we can take this whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.120" end="01:01:28.110" style="s2">thing we can contend because a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.550" end="01:01:30.990" style="s2">people watching this right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.110" end="01:01:32.430" style="s2">you&#39;re ignoring politics as usual we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.990" end="01:01:34.500" style="s2">actually have a different sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.430" end="01:01:37.350" style="s2">politics that takes real thinking real</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.500" end="01:01:38.700" style="s2">ideas real solutions and brings them to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.350" end="01:01:41.970" style="s2">the highest levels of our government</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.700" end="01:01:45.270" style="s2">it just needs enough Eric&#39;s and PS and</p>
