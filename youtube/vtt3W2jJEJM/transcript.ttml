<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">taking place the question is of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">can we accomplish this transformation</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">about change we have to start reaching</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">out it&#39;s all very well sitting</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.260" style="s2">volunteered something ourselves already</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:05.940" style="s2">what mine we are already here right</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.260" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">already on what we&#39;ve already woken up</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.940" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">so really if we are to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">peaceful lasting change in this world</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">we have to reach out for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">not here today millions and millions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">millions of people out there that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">little no idea of what a truly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.190" style="s2">precarious which is precarious forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.890" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">situation our society is in and so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.190" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">they are on board looking for solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">to the same problems more Minds working</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">on the same problem is better obviously</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">now this is not easy but I take heart</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:38.460" style="s2">from the fact that it has been done</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">before many of you will be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.460" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">its quote this is a very very famous</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:45.300" style="s2">quote there that a small group of active</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">citizens can envy bring about global</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.300" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">change and that is what we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.900" style="s2">do so I&#39;m going to start with a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.180" style="s2">basic principles of communication which</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.900" end="00:02:56.580" style="s2">applies to anything conversation writing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.180" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">rating videos whatever they may be I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.580" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">give you a couple of examples and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:01.740" style="s2">for the last part I&#39;m going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">look at giving presentations such as</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.740" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">this you know in schools in workplaces</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:09.870" style="s2">in community halls whatever it might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">so first principle is keep educating</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.870" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">yourself the more you know the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:16.110" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do that the more the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">more fully the more capability going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.110" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">be able to explain things to people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">conversations have a tendency to take on</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">a life of their own inherently</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">unpredictable and so the more you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.190" style="s2">the more tools you will have at your</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">disposal to be able to adapt and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.190" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">explain to adapt to the changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">circumstances of a conversation jargon</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:34.110" style="s2">masks ignorance do not try and bribe</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">people with lots of long flashy words</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.110" end="00:03:37.800" style="s2">that you&#39;ve learned all this does is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">highlight your own ignorance your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.800" end="00:03:42.320" style="s2">lack of profound understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">cannot explain things in simple everyday</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.320" end="00:03:45.810" style="s2">accessible language then you need</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">certain need to learn it more thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.810" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.349" end="00:03:58.760" style="s2">thank you thank you very video second</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:04:00.440" style="s2">principle is to go one step at a time if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.760" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">you just jump in and start saying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.440" end="00:04:04.940" style="s2">people you know our entire system is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:06.739" style="s2">scam you&#39;ve been enslaved by sitting and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.940" end="00:04:09.500" style="s2">don&#39;t give a about who your labor</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.739" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">is stolen you&#39;re forced to obey rules by</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.500" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">coercive system there has a monopoly on</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">force you&#39;re brainwashed by propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.310" style="s2">and advertising and media wars are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.419" end="00:04:20.930" style="s2">started for profit our educational</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.310" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">system deliberately dumbs us down</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.930" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">hundreds of minutes of tens of millions</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:26.450" style="s2">of people every year are killed through</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.340" style="s2">various forms of structural bond with</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.450" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">decisions are made you know securely</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.340" end="00:04:32.090" style="s2">based on the needs of the 1% and with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:34.100" style="s2">the needs of everyday people on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.090" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">planet itself until you stop doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.100" end="00:04:37.870" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get one or two results</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">or so you&#39;ve got to start from a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.570" style="s2">of common experience a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">can agree on and then going small</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.570" end="00:04:56.570" style="s2">manageable sets from there for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:59.750" style="s2">principle number three is the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.570" end="00:05:02.060" style="s2">important one because that is the truly</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.750" end="00:05:04.669" style="s2">important question is why do these</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.060" end="00:05:06.979" style="s2">things go on people have to fill these</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.669" end="00:05:08.660" style="s2">understandings on their own economy you</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.979" end="00:05:10.250" style="s2">can get them started on the road but</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.660" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">ultimately you have to get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.250" end="00:05:13.610" style="s2">where they are asking their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">questions they&#39;re trying to try to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.610" end="00:05:18.050" style="s2">to these conclusions on their own at</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">that other people simply don&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.050" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">themselves the right kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">they&#39;re not equipped to do so it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">and they are not given right information</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:26.870" style="s2">by our information sources in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">ask themselves the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.870" end="00:05:30.979" style="s2">question so it up to us to build those</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">bridges from their common ground and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.979" end="00:05:34.280" style="s2">things that we can all agree on from</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">everyday common experience every day is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.280" end="00:05:38.600" style="s2">common common knowledge of things which</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:40.430" style="s2">are wrong with the world both from there</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.600" end="00:05:42.289" style="s2">and then lead them to some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.430" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">extreme things some of the more radical</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.289" end="00:05:45.530" style="s2">ideas that we need them to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:47.510" style="s2">that we need to talk about we need them</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:49.880" style="s2">to understand you can use various forms</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.510" end="00:05:51.870" style="s2">of media to start this up and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.880" end="00:05:52.680" style="s2">what I like to do when I&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.870" end="00:05:53.940" style="s2">you know with a friend or an</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.680" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">acquaintance I&#39;m really putting people</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:05:57.930" style="s2">that maybe don&#39;t know fix me well I like</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.860" end="00:21:15.240" style="s2">it is connecting and so the best way is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.380" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">to go round of really make individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.240" end="00:21:19.290" style="s2">icons with our five concept with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.010" end="00:21:20.610" style="s2">somebody move on to somebody else and so</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.610" end="00:21:22.680" style="s2">sentence of one person and then move on</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.680" end="00:21:26.310" style="s2">let&#39;s create intimacy between you and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:28.380" style="s2">your audience and you&#39;ll talk will have</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.310" end="00:21:30.210" style="s2">a more conversational feel rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.380" end="00:21:32.190" style="s2">lecture it will feel a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.210" end="00:21:35.060" style="s2">like a conversation albeit at somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.190" end="00:21:35.060" style="s2">one-sided one</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.740" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">tip number four I am I&#39;m somewhat I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.020" end="00:21:45.059" style="s2">somewhat guilty of not doing is I talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:47.399" style="s2">very quickly in my natural state anyway</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.059" end="00:21:50.010" style="s2">and so I deliberately slow myself down</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.399" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">this is me talking slowly believe it or</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.010" end="00:21:54.299" style="s2">not and if you&#39;re nervous you will tend</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.980" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">to rush and so you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.299" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">deliberate efforts to pause at the end</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:01.289" style="s2">of each sentence even in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:04.260" style="s2">sentence you really can&#39;t go through</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.289" end="00:22:05.970" style="s2">slowly remember your audience wants you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.260" end="00:22:07.380" style="s2">to succeed they don&#39;t want to sit there</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.970" end="00:22:09.899" style="s2">feeling awkward that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.380" end="00:22:15.289" style="s2">succeeding they want you to see and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.899" end="00:22:15.289" style="s2">they will hang on your every</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.990" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">another one that I tend to be guilty of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.760" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">are use phrases like rating the planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:43.210" style="s2">and enslaving mankind as mass murder and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:46.120" style="s2">stuff like that and you know it is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:47.529" style="s2">dramatic and writing it&#39;s fine you can</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.529" end="00:22:51.279" style="s2">and it can be quite relaxing quite fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.179" end="00:22:54.309" style="s2">to read but if you knew this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.279" end="00:22:56.049" style="s2">language in conversation with people it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.309" end="00:22:58.299" style="s2">kind of constitutes a form of verbal</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.299" end="00:23:02.679" style="s2">to protect themselves right and so now</p>
