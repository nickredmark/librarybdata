<p begin="00:01:12.849" end="00:01:18.250" style="s2">normally wouldn&#39;t have stumbled across</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.380" end="00:01:20.530" style="s2">but somehow I did and as I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.250" end="00:01:22.569" style="s2">it I was going wow this book even though</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.530" end="00:01:23.830" style="s2">it comes from a lens that is so</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.569" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">different from anything I&#39;ve ever been</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.830" end="00:01:28.750" style="s2">exposed to before comes up with some</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.489" style="s2">conclusions and perspectives on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.750" end="00:01:33.310" style="s2">nature of reality and the nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.489" end="00:01:35.590" style="s2">civilization then I found just uncannily</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.310" end="00:01:37.630" style="s2">similar to some of the things myself and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.590" end="00:01:39.429" style="s2">other people are working on and I hope</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.130" end="00:01:53.739" style="s2">this podcast at Jim rutt show dot-com so</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:55.330" style="s2">so often we read about peoples and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.739" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">cultures around the world from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.330" end="00:01:59.319" style="s2">Western reductionist scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.660" style="s2">perspective you know here are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.319" end="00:02:03.310" style="s2">kinship rules here&#39;s you know how they</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.660" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">you know extracted energy from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.310" end="00:02:07.929" style="s2">system etc sort of classic cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">anthropology Jason makes what to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.929" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">is an amazing and audacious move and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:16.299" style="s2">essentially while we&#39;ll be learning a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:18.670" style="s2">fair amount about indigenous culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.299" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">what he&#39;s really doing is looking back</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.670" end="00:02:22.040" style="s2">out at the wider world using an</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:24.739" style="s2">indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.040" end="00:02:26.030" style="s2">lenz is that fair you think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.739" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">good way to describe what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.030" end="00:02:31.609" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s fair that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:34.010" style="s2">good way of saying um yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.609" end="00:02:36.379" style="s2">it&#39;s a complexity lens you know um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.010" end="00:02:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s I think complexity theory is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.379" end="00:02:40.549" style="s2">really good metaphor that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.840" end="00:02:41.650" style="s2">aligns quite well with the lens that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.549" end="00:02:44.810" style="s2">we&#39;re looking through here</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.650" end="00:02:46.730" style="s2">indeed that I was so taken by you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.810" end="00:02:49.879" style="s2">people listen the show no I&#39;m I complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.730" end="00:02:52.329" style="s2">at Orion if there is such a thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.879" end="00:02:54.590" style="s2">was very taken with the way you wove</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.329" end="00:02:56.659" style="s2">complexity into the story in a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.590" end="00:02:58.370" style="s2">natural way and I got curious so I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.659" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">to do this search I&#39;m a bit of a numbers</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:04.430" style="s2">nerd how you to know is exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">though in this case was more like 12 the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.430" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">word complex or complexity appeared</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">seventy-seven times in your book you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:15.019" style="s2">probably didn&#39;t even know that I did not</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:16.280" style="s2">know that before we hop in let&#39;s talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.019" end="00:03:18.829" style="s2">little bit about you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.280" end="00:03:19.879" style="s2">definitions and and a tool that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.829" end="00:03:22.310" style="s2">describe it I thought was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.879" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">interesting you basically had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.310" end="00:03:28.190" style="s2">concept of two hands one fingers held</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">together horizontally and the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.190" end="00:03:31.819" style="s2">held up vertically with the fingers</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:33.530" style="s2">apart could you maybe frame that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.819" end="00:03:34.489" style="s2">little bit as sort of a framework which</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.530" end="00:03:37.159" style="s2">I found to be useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.489" end="00:03:39.829" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.159" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">described already it&#39;s um I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.829" end="00:03:45.229" style="s2">often when when you know any knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:48.530" style="s2">of indigenous cultures is always viewed</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.229" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">through that Western lens so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.530" end="00:03:52.760" style="s2">had sort of worked it into a hand</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:56.599" style="s2">gesture because as with most of the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.760" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">I tried to well I I mean I did express</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.599" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">all of the knowledge first in nonverbal</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">forms you know through traditional</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">carvings and you know lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:07.250" style="s2">practices and one of those ideas was</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:09.769" style="s2">just in a hand gesture which also came</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.250" end="00:04:11.329" style="s2">out as a symbol a visual symbol but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.769" end="00:04:13.159" style="s2">so it&#39;s got a closed hand that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.329" end="00:04:15.949" style="s2">reading a book and then it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.159" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">spread open hand like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.949" end="00:04:21.109" style="s2">rock hand stencil paintings you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:23.090" style="s2">have seen in caves around the world you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.109" end="00:04:25.430" style="s2">know so usually we&#39;re kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.090" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">view that open hand you know through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.430" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">closed hand of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">book you know and you don&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">it you just see the edges of it just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:34.550" style="s2">tips of the fingers but if you turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.170" style="s2">around the other way and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.550" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">closed hand through the open hand at</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.170" end="00:04:41.480" style="s2">some you get a lot more clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">interesting perspective so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.480" end="00:04:45.890" style="s2">like to do that a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:48.650" style="s2">reversal a lot of my work is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.890" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">reverse anthropology I guess you might</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.650" end="00:04:53.900" style="s2">call it and and it&#39;s really cheeky yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">I I mean I think I mean it really just</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.900" end="00:04:57.410" style="s2">skates along the edge of pop science in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:04:59.990" style="s2">fact I think you could probably call it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.410" end="00:05:01.910" style="s2">pop science the book more than serious</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.990" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">scholarship you know and a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.910" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">work is like that just because I just</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">like having a laugh most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:10.310" style="s2">yeah I found that that&#39;s a good term</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:12.950" style="s2">reverse anthropology I also found it</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.310" end="00:05:15.140" style="s2">kind of this beautiful riff and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.950" end="00:05:17.140" style="s2">like weaving right it goes here it goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.140" end="00:05:19.820" style="s2">there it comes back but it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.140" end="00:05:21.770" style="s2">holistically truthfully I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:24.220" style="s2">the book is a work of art and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.770" end="00:05:27.380" style="s2">kidding I really did find it unusual</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.220" end="00:05:28.970" style="s2">richness and yet not necessarily linear</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.380" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">you know the same ideas would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.970" end="00:05:32.810" style="s2">examined in three different ways at</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:34.490" style="s2">three different places in the book and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.810" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2">they all made sense within the context</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.490" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">we&#39;re in not the kind of thing that a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.680" end="00:05:42.200" style="s2">typical academic monograph would do</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">before we jump into the book I usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.200" end="00:05:46.700" style="s2">don&#39;t do a lot of bio but your biography</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:47.930" style="s2">is is intimately woven through the book</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.700" end="00:05:49.250" style="s2">and you know I don&#39;t want the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.930" end="00:05:51.200" style="s2">story but just maybe there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.250" end="00:05:53.150" style="s2">short version so it&#39;s just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.200" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">about the epaulettes clan who they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.150" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">where do they live today and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">the teeny bit about your own remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:06:02.990" style="s2">life journey</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:04.610" style="s2">ah my remarkable life journey yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.990" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">always have to do the burger if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.610" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">don&#39;t me but look the yes an upper-class</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:12.710" style="s2">or some Western Cape York the homeland</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:14.689" style="s2">there is a few different places would</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.710" end="00:06:20.389" style="s2">includes a place called Cape Kilauea</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.689" end="00:06:22.729" style="s2">which is Dutch for turn back this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.389" end="00:06:24.590" style="s2">five hundred years ago we had a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.729" end="00:06:27.349" style="s2">bit of an incursion there from from</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.590" end="00:06:30.919" style="s2">Dutch traders yeah most of them ended up</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.349" end="00:06:32.569" style="s2">getting speared and he went back because</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.919" end="00:06:36.020" style="s2">they were trading things like soap and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.569" end="00:06:38.270" style="s2">rice and and they unfortunately Europe</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.020" end="00:06:40.939" style="s2">at the time regarded women as chattel as</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.270" end="00:06:43.099" style="s2">well and they figured that the women</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.939" end="00:06:47.719" style="s2">were a resource as well to be traded and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.099" end="00:06:49.610" style="s2">they got a bit of a rude shock here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.719" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">the women were not we&#39;re not having that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:56.539" style="s2">so um yeah how most of them got speared</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:06:58.219" style="s2">and they lived back to Holland and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.539" end="00:07:01.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s interestingly enough that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.219" end="00:07:04.819" style="s2">little encounter with the wick people</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.210" end="00:07:08.150" style="s2">particularly uplet&#39;s clan Western Cape</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.819" end="00:07:11.479" style="s2">you up there that spawned the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.150" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">first corporation because you know they</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.479" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">made such heavy losses on that trip the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:17.810" style="s2">people that were funding the trip were</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">quite upset about it and I guess they</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.810" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">had to find a way to shift</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">accountability around so they they</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.110" end="00:07:25.669" style="s2">invented that corporate entity in there</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:27.469" style="s2">so the Dutch East India Company was born</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.669" end="00:07:28.969" style="s2">and then that kind of spread British</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.469" end="00:07:31.339" style="s2">East India Company and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.969" end="00:07:33.650" style="s2">thing and corporations became the norm</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.339" end="00:07:38.419" style="s2">and yeah and then out of that came the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.650" end="00:07:40.819" style="s2">whole land as capital situation which</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.419" end="00:07:43.339" style="s2">pretty much created the pyramid scheme</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.819" end="00:07:46.189" style="s2">that we have for a global economic</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.339" end="00:07:48.680" style="s2">system today so you know there was our</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.189" end="00:07:52.189" style="s2">fault really oh yeah that play all your</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.680" end="00:07:55.099" style="s2">fault right so you can blame you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.189" end="00:07:57.889" style="s2">blame my extended family for for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.099" end="00:07:59.990" style="s2">entire global financial crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.889" end="00:08:02.719" style="s2">everything else we we caused that about</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.990" end="00:08:05.089" style="s2">500 years ago and you know my my</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.719" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">personally my life is like I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.089" end="00:08:09.830" style="s2">divided into three parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:11.419" style="s2">you know so the first and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.830" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">there&#39;ll be four parts in another ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.419" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">years or so but yeah I&#39;m just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.270" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">starting on the fourth part but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:23.270" style="s2">first part was um you know I I kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:26.509" style="s2">was defined as a part</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.270" end="00:08:29.270" style="s2">Aboriginal and so my identity was very</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.509" end="00:08:33.020" style="s2">much tied up with these weird racist</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.270" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">ideas of a genetic inheritance that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.020" end="00:08:37.789" style="s2">would mean that I&#39;d drink and fight more</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:40.969" style="s2">than everyone else and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.789" end="00:08:43.490" style="s2">pretty much the first for my life so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.969" end="00:08:45.170" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing really useful or</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.490" end="00:08:47.300" style="s2">interesting to come out of my youth just</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.170" end="00:08:49.459" style="s2">a whole heap of bloodshed and whoa and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.300" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">then I guess the second part of my life</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.459" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">I was I sort of saw my identity as being</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:57.589" style="s2">cultural and tied to material culture so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.430" end="00:09:01.670" style="s2">I was you know playing the didgeridoo</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.589" end="00:09:05.060" style="s2">and making boomerangs and clap sticks</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.670" end="00:09:08.779" style="s2">and always you know dancing robberies</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.060" end="00:09:11.959" style="s2">and you know hunting and then but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.779" end="00:09:15.140" style="s2">know in a really performative way do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.959" end="00:09:17.570" style="s2">know what I mean like oh look at me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.140" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">the real deal I&#39;m really authentic so</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.570" end="00:09:24.440" style="s2">that was the that second third there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:26.329" style="s2">I guess this last bit the last decade</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.440" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2">and a half or so two decades has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.329" end="00:09:32.829" style="s2">more you know understanding my identity</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:37.520" style="s2">and my cotton war as a knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.829" end="00:09:40.190" style="s2">you know as a system of of knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.520" end="00:09:42.589" style="s2">not just know how about I here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:44.089" style="s2">you get this medicine plantain you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.589" end="00:09:46.100" style="s2">here&#39;s how you catch a fish or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.089" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not that kind of thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.100" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">actually though the ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:52.760" style="s2">patterns of thinking and that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:55.339" style="s2">systems of logic that have really um</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.760" end="00:09:57.620" style="s2">have really taken me and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.339" end="00:09:59.690" style="s2">know that just made me into a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.620" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2">better person who&#39;s sometimes worth</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.690" end="00:10:04.430" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:07.070" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s good in fact I know you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.430" end="00:10:08.360" style="s2">reference it in various ways but I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.070" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">one of the one of the things I took away</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.360" end="00:10:13.610" style="s2">from the book is that you treat your</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:16.610" style="s2">culture as alive rather than as a museum</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.610" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">artifact right yeah you know this or</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.610" end="00:10:20.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t this lovely stick from 800 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:23.090" style="s2">ago and it&#39;s meaning whatever okay well</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.960" end="00:10:24.980" style="s2">there is some use to that but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.090" end="00:10:27.170" style="s2">took away you know the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.980" end="00:10:30.080" style="s2">interpreting the Aboriginal way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.170" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">seeing this lens as live and adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.080" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">and interacting with the world I love</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:36.830" style="s2">the little riff you had with the elder</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:38.840" style="s2">about the cell phone right yeah those of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.830" end="00:10:40.820" style="s2">you who listen to the show know I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.840" end="00:10:42.770" style="s2">my struggles with cell phone addiction I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.820" end="00:10:44.390" style="s2">wrote an essay called was it something</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.770" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">like recapturing our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.390" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">sovereignty or something about how I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:51.080" style="s2">ditched the cell phone for a flip phone</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">right but yet cell phones have found</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.080" end="00:10:55.220" style="s2">their way deeply into contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:59.000" style="s2">Aboriginal culture with god-knows-what</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.220" end="00:11:02.510" style="s2">implications right so I like that well I</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.000" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">mean the adult literacies improved you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.510" end="00:11:06.440" style="s2">know in communities where all the adults</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">were illiterate everybody learned to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.440" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">read and write in in about three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.590" style="s2">after getting their mobile phones cuz</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:13.880" style="s2">everyone was aromas texting so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.590" end="00:11:15.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good thing but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.880" end="00:11:18.860" style="s2">also a lot of really negative</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.320" end="00:11:21.020" style="s2">consequences as well yeah I did do a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.860" end="00:11:22.280" style="s2">podcast about that we did one season</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.020" end="00:11:24.650" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to be doing another one</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.280" end="00:11:26.450" style="s2">but you know covert yeah looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.650" end="00:11:30.080" style="s2">impacts of those see I got my first</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.450" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">mobile phone in 2016 there was the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.080" end="00:11:34.660" style="s2">time I had one and it&#39;s just it has</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:37.250" style="s2">messed with my cognition horrendously</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.660" end="00:11:39.500" style="s2">it&#39;s messed with the way I connect to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.250" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">the world and to other people and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.500" end="00:11:42.530" style="s2">of went oh now I understand why</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:45.650" style="s2">everybody got so weird over the last</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.530" end="00:11:47.660" style="s2">decade yeah that was it but I actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.650" end="00:11:49.550" style="s2">have to have one because you I can&#39;t log</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.660" end="00:11:53.570" style="s2">on to my work computer without having</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.550" end="00:11:55.790" style="s2">this app for security on my phone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.570" end="00:11:57.560" style="s2">that goddamn second token it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.790" end="00:12:00.470" style="s2">almost impossible to be rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.560" end="00:12:02.600" style="s2">things you know I try hard not to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.470" end="00:12:04.850" style="s2">enslaved I think I bought my well you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.600" end="00:12:08.690" style="s2">like you like this story when I was a my</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.850" end="00:12:10.580" style="s2">last work gig I was a CEO of a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.690" end="00:12:12.230" style="s2">high intensity company and we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.580" end="00:12:13.970" style="s2">had to have a cell phone and I was out</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.230" end="00:12:16.100" style="s2">of the office so paid instructed my</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.970" end="00:12:17.840" style="s2">assistant to keep three cell phones in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">her drawer and when I went out of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.840" end="00:12:21.710" style="s2">office for you know a business meeting</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:23.660" style="s2">or a trip downtown to argue with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.710" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">government or something she&#39;d give me a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.660" end="00:12:29.090" style="s2">phone and in those days in the DC area</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.300" end="00:12:30.830" style="s2">mostly I&#39;m think because of the CIA we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.090" end="00:12:32.960" style="s2">were in outer fringes of the DC area</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.830" end="00:12:34.579" style="s2">there were a lot of black spots where</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.960" end="00:12:36.860" style="s2">the reception just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.579" end="00:12:39.259" style="s2">and famously whenever I was on a call</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.259" end="00:12:42.259" style="s2">would just roll the window down in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.579" end="00:12:44.540" style="s2">pickup truck and throw the cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.259" end="00:12:46.519" style="s2">out the window I&#39;d get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.540" end="00:12:49.129" style="s2">office and I say Jana you better order</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.519" end="00:12:51.139" style="s2">another cell phone cuz the damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.129" end="00:12:52.670" style="s2">pissed me off but you know later when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.139" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">retired I had a cell phone but I always</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.670" end="00:12:56.509" style="s2">warn people don&#39;t ever call it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:59.689" style="s2">probably in my sock drawer and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.509" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">probably was until 2010 god dammit when</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.689" end="00:13:03.980" style="s2">they got good enough that they became so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:06.649" style="s2">seductive that even you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.980" end="00:13:08.869" style="s2">forced I was forced yeah yeah just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.649" end="00:13:11.509" style="s2">the fat boy with the bag of macaroons</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.869" end="00:13:15.379" style="s2">I&#39;ll confess to say I am a person of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.509" end="00:13:17.629" style="s2">girth so I can say this it&#39;s like a fat</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.379" end="00:13:20.089" style="s2">boy with a bag of macaroons the goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.629" end="00:13:22.819" style="s2">things became so useful and so seductive</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.089" end="00:13:25.549" style="s2">they&#39;re really really hard to put down</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.819" end="00:13:27.860" style="s2">but they have anything maybe the CIA was</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.549" end="00:13:32.239" style="s2">up to you then anyway because you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.860" end="00:13:34.009" style="s2">what&#39;s this game be stuff you know keeps</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.239" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">ditching his burner phones he&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.009" end="00:13:36.829" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:39.350" style="s2">well that was back the day when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.829" end="00:13:40.790" style="s2">classic game a so hey if</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.350" end="00:13:42.739" style="s2">they at least weren&#39;t worried about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.790" end="00:13:44.569" style="s2">right there you go I did a word search</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.739" end="00:13:49.699" style="s2">on your show as well and the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.569" end="00:13:54.350" style="s2"> comes up 127 times I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.699" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">really I just made that up only 127 my</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.350" end="00:14:03.019" style="s2">side of the bag that&#39;s only about two</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:14:04.879" style="s2">per episode let&#39;s get down to it a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.019" end="00:14:06.319" style="s2">little bit further one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.879" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">things that you talk about in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.319" end="00:14:12.259" style="s2">upfront part of the book is the concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:14.689" style="s2">of civilization and guess what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.259" end="00:14:18.589" style="s2">use it in the usual positive valence</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.689" end="00:14:20.689" style="s2">right in fact quite the contrary what</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.589" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">does the word civilization mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.689" end="00:14:26.149" style="s2">what are its implications well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:27.919" style="s2">exactly I mean you know the way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.149" end="00:14:30.879" style="s2">not a really good definition for it they</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.919" end="00:14:35.089" style="s2">talk vaguely about rule of law and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.879" end="00:14:38.449" style="s2">you know systems of laws and arts and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.089" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">culture and you know surpluses of food</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.449" end="00:14:42.679" style="s2">or whatever like I don&#39;t know and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:45.350" style="s2">talk about and bread for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.679" end="00:14:46.940" style="s2">like grinding flour for bread is a sign</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.350" end="00:14:49.430" style="s2">of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.940" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">why that is yeah but they&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.430" end="00:14:54.740" style="s2">they&#39;re found grinding stones now that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.650" end="00:14:56.750" style="s2">predate lack Egyptians grinding flour so</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">in Australia we&#39;ve got the whole disturb</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.750" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">flour grinding history of anybody when</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:05.030" style="s2">they recently actually destroyed that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.140" style="s2">site a mining company destroyed the site</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.030" end="00:15:08.150" style="s2">I think they want to get rid of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.140" end="00:15:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s unpleasant for them but for me as</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.150" end="00:15:13.850" style="s2">civilization is um it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.960" end="00:15:16.100" style="s2">community that must be constantly</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.850" end="00:15:17.900" style="s2">growing or it will collapse and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:21.110" style="s2">therefore it relies on the importation</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.900" end="00:15:23.150" style="s2">of resources that&#39;s it that&#39;s all I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.110" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">find in common across all these places</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.150" end="00:15:26.690" style="s2">that call themselves civilizations and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:28.570" style="s2">they all behave the same way and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.690" end="00:15:31.520" style="s2">have that growth based imperative that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.570" end="00:15:34.460" style="s2">growth based paradigm and its are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.520" end="00:15:36.650" style="s2">impossible it&#39;s a denial of reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.460" end="00:15:39.770" style="s2">a denial of physics it&#39;s a denial of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.650" end="00:15:42.500" style="s2">everything and it&#39;s some I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.770" end="00:15:44.420" style="s2">if you want a definition of evil I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.500" end="00:15:47.870" style="s2">um it&#39;s probably a good one</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.420" end="00:15:49.910" style="s2">it&#39;s just denial of reality yep and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.870" end="00:15:52.580" style="s2">know just frankly plain old math right I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.910" end="00:15:53.540" style="s2">mean the math of exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.580" end="00:15:55.460" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.540" end="00:15:58.250" style="s2">guess what it doesn&#39;t work right</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.460" end="00:15:59.930" style="s2">eventually you hit the limit one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.250" end="00:16:01.790" style="s2">good thinkers I forget who was it</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.930" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">Herbert Simon somebody said you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.790" end="00:16:06.230" style="s2">something can&#39;t grow forever it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.690" style="s2">right yeah this may not be a warning to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.230" end="00:16:11.030" style="s2">you right well I mean we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.690" end="00:16:13.730" style="s2">different in Aboriginal Australia here</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.030" end="00:16:16.550" style="s2">we have a different paradigm and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.730" end="00:16:18.890" style="s2">sounds similar it&#39;s some it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.550" end="00:16:20.780" style="s2">very subtle difference instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.890" end="00:16:24.140" style="s2">growth based paradigm we have an</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.780" end="00:16:26.780" style="s2">increase paradigm so we have actually we</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.140" end="00:16:30.440" style="s2">actually have annual increase ceremonies</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.780" end="00:16:32.420" style="s2">that we do to organize all those</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.440" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">behaviors and get everybody on on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.420" end="00:16:38.630" style="s2">right page with that and also to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:42.140" style="s2">know to to be able to sort of model</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.630" end="00:16:43.580" style="s2">create a model I guess a simulation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.140" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">trying to translate this into your</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.580" end="00:16:49.760" style="s2">language a simulation in a ritual space</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:52.940" style="s2">of of what needs to occur in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.760" end="00:16:55.430" style="s2">ecosystem for increase to occur so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.940" end="00:16:57.140" style="s2">increase is different from growth you</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.430" end="00:16:59.150" style="s2">know because you don&#39;t want the size of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.140" end="00:17:00.410" style="s2">the system to grow but you want the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.150" end="00:17:02.180" style="s2">relationships within</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.410" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">system the exchange within the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.180" end="00:17:06.589" style="s2">that needs to increase and you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:08.750" style="s2">increase that quite infinitely so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.589" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">guess it would be like gum if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.750" end="00:17:12.829" style="s2">to get smarter you wouldn&#39;t need to grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">a big brain you just have to make more</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.829" end="00:17:17.449" style="s2">neural connections so it&#39;s kind of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.459" style="s2">kind of like that so it&#39;s an increased</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.449" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">fat if it was aniconic like like we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.459" end="00:17:23.569" style="s2">we&#39;re not really interested in you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">quantitative easing this kind of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.569" end="00:17:27.740" style="s2">not interested in the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:29.720" style="s2">economy but we are very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.740" end="00:17:31.929" style="s2">the velocity of the dollar you know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.720" end="00:17:35.240" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.929" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">puts that lens on it yeah I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.240" end="00:17:40.940" style="s2">that sometimes when we talk about D grow</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:44.179" style="s2">thing I am careful to make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.940" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">we certainly need to do with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.179" end="00:17:48.500" style="s2">what I call gross growth or macro growth</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:50.690" style="s2">you know that couldn&#39;t you know tearing</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.500" end="00:17:54.200" style="s2">the earth up pulling stuff out of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.690" end="00:17:56.870" style="s2">burning fossil fuels destroying intact</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.200" end="00:17:59.059" style="s2">forests and grasslands for industrial</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">agriculture etc but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.059" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">growth into the microcosm doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:06.140" style="s2">disrupt the way the world operates</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:08.900" style="s2">there&#39;s no real limit to for instance</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.140" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">you know how rich our poetry could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.900" end="00:18:12.830" style="s2">for instance write poetry may get richer</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:15.650" style="s2">over time I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.830" end="00:18:18.620" style="s2">much about poetry but art certainly has</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.650" end="00:18:20.179" style="s2">gotten in some ways rich or at least new</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.620" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">techniques have been added probably some</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.179" end="00:18:24.460" style="s2">of that circular but I like your</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">perspective also that if we make our</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.460" end="00:18:30.740" style="s2">relationship map better and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:32.750" style="s2">fulfilling that&#39;s a form of micro growth</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.740" end="00:18:34.520" style="s2">right growth into the microcosm and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.750" end="00:18:35.929" style="s2">making that distinction is important</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.520" end="00:18:37.970" style="s2">because you know saying that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.929" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">de Groote mean that life can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.970" end="00:18:44.120" style="s2">getting richer it can&#39;t write it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:45.260" style="s2">as-tested respect the outer envelope you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.120" end="00:18:47.299" style="s2">know the other thing you know gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.260" end="00:18:49.940" style="s2">in your perspective of that thing which</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.299" end="00:18:52.490" style="s2">has to grow you also are pretty specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.940" end="00:18:54.669" style="s2">about the manifestation which is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.490" end="00:18:57.740" style="s2">city that everything that you call a</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.669" end="00:19:01.159" style="s2">civilization build cities did the</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.159" end="00:19:06.890" style="s2">particularly they were so you would sort</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:16.460" style="s2">of a bioregion really and so your</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.970" end="00:19:19.220" style="s2">language would would be perfectly suited</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.460" end="00:19:22.130" style="s2">to that bio region and those borders</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.220" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">were or maintained as such and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.130" end="00:19:25.610" style="s2">that&#39;s how if you look at an Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.830" style="s2">map of Australia there&#39;s about 500</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.610" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">different countries and different</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.830" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">languages dialects etc there was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:37.220" style="s2">one&#39;s situation referred to in the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:41.420" style="s2">of the Barker G mob who experimented</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.220" end="00:19:43.250" style="s2">with a sedentary lifestyle and they had</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.420" end="00:19:43.820" style="s2">all lots of different people coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.250" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.820" end="00:19:47.630" style="s2">select the Tower of Babel story in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:48.950" style="s2">Bible you know and they will came</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.630" end="00:19:50.390" style="s2">together and they forgot all their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.950" end="00:19:52.850" style="s2">languages and started speaking their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.390" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">language but then when the earth moved</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.850" end="00:19:57.470" style="s2">as the earth inevitably does they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">forgotten how to move with it and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.470" end="00:20:01.460" style="s2">they were nearly wiped out you know so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:03.110" style="s2">they kept that story you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.460" end="00:20:06.679" style="s2">painted that story down we&#39;ve had lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.110" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">of apocalypsis to remind us of that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.679" end="00:20:10.730" style="s2">you have these sort of seasonal estates</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:13.190" style="s2">like you move around those estates</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.730" end="00:20:14.540" style="s2">seasonally and care for the different</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.190" end="00:20:16.550" style="s2">parts of that country in the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.540" end="00:20:18.110" style="s2">season you know I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.550" end="00:20:20.809" style="s2">kind of how you operate and you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.110" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">several different camps there sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.809" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">the camps are a lot more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got something down in Victoria</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:28.670" style="s2">where we&#39;re living now people were</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">building their houses out of stone and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.670" end="00:20:34.130" style="s2">some quite large ones that sleep up to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:35.960" style="s2">20 people or something and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.130" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">of early settler accounts of that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.960" end="00:20:40.790" style="s2">was so sturdy that the settlers are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:42.290" style="s2">riding their horses up on the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.790" end="00:20:44.210" style="s2">stone house and getting their picture</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.290" end="00:20:47.210" style="s2">taken or but he painted or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.210" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">is that they do you know so there were</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.210" end="00:20:51.950" style="s2">there was a there was a aquaculture</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:54.740" style="s2">system here where there was Mason</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.950" end="00:20:57.650" style="s2">reliant canals and things like that but</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.740" end="00:21:00.290" style="s2">people still move seasonally around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.650" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">big estates so it wasn&#39;t really you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.290" end="00:21:04.610" style="s2">this permanent sedentary thing some</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:07.850" style="s2">places though that the food was so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.610" end="00:21:10.370" style="s2">abundant particularly on the coast the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.850" end="00:21:12.440" style="s2">north northeast coast there of Australia</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.370" end="00:21:15.020" style="s2">there were some places where just some</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.440" end="00:21:17.780" style="s2">people just stayed put yeah so there</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.020" end="00:21:20.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard reports of some permanent</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.780" end="00:21:22.010" style="s2">settlements are happening big just</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.060" end="00:21:22.669" style="s2">because the coastal area was so abundant</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.010" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">with fur</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.669" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">that nobody needed to move but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:30.049" style="s2">coastlines move yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.669" style="s2">very true especially in something with</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.049" end="00:21:34.220" style="s2">the time depth of Australia I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.669" end="00:21:36.289" style="s2">Australia was settled when the Ice Ages</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.220" end="00:21:38.600" style="s2">were still high all right and the water</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.289" end="00:21:40.220" style="s2">level was low and you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.600" end="00:21:42.710" style="s2">mentioned in the book there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.220" end="00:21:44.779" style="s2">traditions about the inundations that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.710" end="00:21:47.210" style="s2">came you know starting maybe 11,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.779" end="00:21:49.669" style="s2">years ago as the ice melted lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.210" end="00:21:52.909" style="s2">areas that had been settled or now 300</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.669" end="00:21:55.549" style="s2">feet underwater yeah we still have maps</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.909" end="00:21:58.009" style="s2">in our oral histories of the land that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.549" end="00:22:00.590" style="s2">under the sea there along the coast so</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.009" end="00:22:03.379" style="s2">it&#39;s still land that we familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.590" end="00:22:05.210" style="s2">through the stories which you kind of I</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.379" end="00:22:08.239" style="s2">don&#39;t know you visualize them stories</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.210" end="00:22:10.129" style="s2">songs these things are maps so you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.239" end="00:22:11.659" style="s2">map that territory and you you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.129" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">caring for that place even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.659" end="00:22:16.580" style="s2">under the sea you know so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:18.859" style="s2">old people they had this this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.580" end="00:22:22.249" style="s2">relationship with whales and dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.859" end="00:22:23.629" style="s2">you know ritually whereby that care for</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.249" end="00:22:25.269" style="s2">that country under the sea and with</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.629" end="00:22:28.460" style="s2">their relationship with those things</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.269" end="00:22:30.739" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of documented incidences of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.460" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">the old fellas calling the dolphins in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.739" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">and that still actually happens today</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.710" style="s2">there&#39;s still lots of people who do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:38.629" style="s2">so they call the dolphins or they make a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.710" end="00:22:40.639" style="s2">sell like bank to rocks together under</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.629" end="00:22:42.499" style="s2">the water and the dolphins know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.639" end="00:22:44.570" style="s2">there and they actually will chase fish</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.499" end="00:22:46.429" style="s2">up towards the beach and into the nets</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.570" end="00:22:49.519" style="s2">and then everyone shares shares the fish</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.429" end="00:22:52.639" style="s2">with the dolphins like that the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.519" end="00:22:56.090" style="s2">when whales are beating the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.639" end="00:22:58.580" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing the spirit you know out</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.090" end="00:23:00.259" style="s2">of the land under the sea there that got</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.580" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">flooded they&#39;re bringing a spirit child</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.259" end="00:23:05.570" style="s2">apart to be born you know so that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:08.659" style="s2">whale brings it up and beaches itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.570" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">there so the old people do do a ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.659" end="00:23:14.059" style="s2">to take that you know that that spirit</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.649" style="s2">that child spirit and don&#39;t put it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.059" end="00:23:18.019" style="s2">the fresh water so that it can travel up</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.649" end="00:23:19.549" style="s2">and get born into the baby they quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.019" end="00:23:21.470" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s amazing amazing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.549" end="00:23:25.549" style="s2">depth of the stories you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.470" end="00:23:27.019" style="s2">recent learnings of European science is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.549" end="00:23:30.679" style="s2">that one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.019" end="00:23:33.409" style="s2">settlements in the British Netherlands</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.679" end="00:23:35.730" style="s2">region is actually now underwater in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.409" end="00:23:38.220" style="s2">North Sea apparently it was probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.730" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">the biggest such settlement maybe eight</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:42.780" style="s2">or nine thousand years ago but within</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.550" style="s2">the traditions of in a Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.780" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">civilization all that&#39;s been swept away</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.550" end="00:23:50.190" style="s2">and nobody remembered it it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:52.920" style="s2">quite impressive yeah well I mean you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.190" end="00:23:54.900" style="s2">got a you&#39;ve got a just I mean you look</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.920" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">at the things that get triggered you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.900" end="00:23:59.700" style="s2">know by these these these shifts so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:02.520" style="s2">mean you got to kind of wish that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.700" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">the land of the angles hadn&#39;t ended up</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.520" end="00:24:07.050" style="s2">start and get it flood and getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:08.610" style="s2">getting flooded you know because if they</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.050" end="00:24:11.670" style="s2">hadn&#39;t had that inundation coming up</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.610" end="00:24:13.680" style="s2">then they they might have ended up</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.670" end="00:24:16.410" style="s2">looking for greener pastures in England</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.680" end="00:24:18.110" style="s2">what became England anyway and now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.410" end="00:24:20.760" style="s2">think things might have been different</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.110" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">yeah but of course we know if we both of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.760" end="00:24:24.510" style="s2">us are interested in the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">the world you know the ability predict</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.510" end="00:24:30.180" style="s2">the future is very slim because so many</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.570" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">things are contingent right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.180" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">it yeah they climate or you know frankly</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:38.520" style="s2">a family feud so you know Charles the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:40.920" style="s2">bald gets thrown out of the family for</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.520" end="00:24:43.260" style="s2">being an asshole and he and his cousins</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.920" end="00:24:45.510" style="s2">get in a boat you know a leaky boat and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.260" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">go across the English Channel and go</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.510" end="00:24:48.630" style="s2">over there and attack the people there</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:50.310" style="s2">and maybe they&#39;re successful maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.630" end="00:24:52.310" style="s2">they&#39;re not but the time that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.310" end="00:24:54.630" style="s2">is successful then they end up slowly</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.310" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">colonizing a new country and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.630" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">happened again and again you made the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:00.210" style="s2">good point that the Brits who were the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:02.370" style="s2">uber colonists themselves had their ass</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.210" end="00:25:04.230" style="s2">kicked at least three times right they</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.370" end="00:25:06.390" style="s2">weren&#39;t an incident they were had their</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.230" end="00:25:08.160" style="s2">ass kicked by the Romans by the Celts</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.390" end="00:25:10.620" style="s2">and then by the Vikings so then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.160" end="00:25:12.990" style="s2">let&#39;s not mention the Normans in 1066</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.620" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">right so everybody gets their ass kicked</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.750" end="00:31:37.850" style="s2">Europeans will look at the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.130" end="00:31:42.360" style="s2">and go oh that&#39;s a guy walking his dog</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.850" end="00:31:43.950" style="s2">in the forest you know yeah so you kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:46.950" style="s2">of sequence things differently and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.950" end="00:31:48.750" style="s2">you attend to different things and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.950" end="00:31:52.710" style="s2">that is mediated by language and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.750" end="00:31:55.460" style="s2">mediated by culture that cognition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.710" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the so called sapir-whorf</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.460" end="00:32:00.600" style="s2">hypothesis right that our language</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:02.520" style="s2">actually conditions are thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.600" end="00:32:04.890" style="s2">pretty substantive ways and it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.520" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">been proven it&#39;s still a conjecture but</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.890" end="00:32:09.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve always thought it&#39;s likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:11.910" style="s2">true right and you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.390" end="00:32:13.110" style="s2">examples you give you know yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.910" end="00:32:14.520" style="s2">there&#39;s some good ones this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.110" end="00:32:16.170" style="s2">little more you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.520" end="00:32:18.900" style="s2">studies so studies of language whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.170" end="00:32:22.710" style="s2">they&#39;ve shown that so Turkish Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.900" end="00:32:25.290" style="s2">and Japanese people will sequence so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.710" end="00:32:26.430" style="s2">cat rolled down the roof in English you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:28.380" style="s2">know if you speak those other three</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.430" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">languages you actually process that in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.380" end="00:32:33.450" style="s2">different order because the cat</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.860" style="s2">descended the roof rolling you know so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.450" end="00:32:37.620" style="s2">that they&#39;ve kind of they&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.860" end="00:32:39.150" style="s2">a lot better studies in the meantime you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.620" end="00:32:42.810" style="s2">know and they&#39;re arranging objects on</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.150" end="00:32:44.550" style="s2">the table you know and then removing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.810" end="00:32:47.400" style="s2">objects and moving the table on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.550" end="00:32:49.770" style="s2">different angle in a different place and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.400" end="00:32:52.100" style="s2">then saying okay place the objects back</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.770" end="00:32:54.360" style="s2">on the table as you remember them so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.100" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">non-indigenous people will tend to put</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.360" end="00:32:59.160" style="s2">the objects align them with the corners</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">of the table you know whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.160" end="00:33:03.570" style="s2">indigenous people will align the objects</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:07.350" style="s2">with the original position you know in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:10.560" style="s2">regard to north south east west you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.350" end="00:33:13.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s that kind of more contextual</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.560" end="00:33:16.290" style="s2">place based cognition rather than that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.890" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">kind of more what they call that field</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.290" end="00:33:24.180" style="s2">independent cognition yeah would make</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:25.800" style="s2">sense that you know the cognitive models</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.180" end="00:33:27.810" style="s2">that were developing from a very young</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.800" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">age much of it mediated by language in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.810" end="00:33:33.090" style="s2">the case of humans are going to impact</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:35.370" style="s2">you know the way we work that&#39;s it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.090" end="00:33:36.900" style="s2">you kind of generalize and say Europeans</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.370" end="00:33:40.950" style="s2">either because Scottish people do the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.900" end="00:33:42.390" style="s2">same thing apparently and you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.950" end="00:33:45.000" style="s2">of other different communities and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.390" end="00:33:47.040" style="s2">you know in some places it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.000" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">they found that the cognition starts to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.040" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">change the more contact you have with</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.520" style="s2">the global economic system yeah you gave</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:55.620" style="s2">a great example in your book actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.520" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">which I have later in my notes but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.620" end="00:34:00.180" style="s2">think we&#39;ll hop to it because I think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2">makes a distinction that you pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.180" end="00:34:07.080" style="s2">which is European white those are just</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:09.149" style="s2">labels we slap on these phenomenon right</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.080" end="00:34:11.580" style="s2">and you keep the very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.149" end="00:34:14.250" style="s2">example of the Sami people used to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.580" end="00:34:16.590" style="s2">known as the Laplanders who are about as</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.250" end="00:34:19.110" style="s2">white as you can possibly be from you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.590" end="00:34:21.270" style="s2">know bright yellow hair and nice pink</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.110" end="00:34:23.700" style="s2">cheeks and all this stuff and they live</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.270" end="00:34:25.560" style="s2">in the far far north of Sweden and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.700" end="00:34:25.700" style="s2">Norway I think maybe a little bit over</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.560" end="00:34:27.889" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.700" end="00:34:31.070" style="s2">border into Russia and yet they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.889" end="00:34:32.329" style="s2">live in a way and maybe they do a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.070" end="00:34:34.250" style="s2">bit more now but until very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.329" end="00:34:36.290" style="s2">recently they live much more like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.250" end="00:34:39.169" style="s2">indigenous people and still to this day</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.290" end="00:34:42.200" style="s2">have a lot of indigenous style ways of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.169" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">seeing the world yeah will they maintain</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.200" end="00:34:46.310" style="s2">their languages and cultures and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:48.530" style="s2">also maintain their herds their reindeer</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.310" end="00:34:50.629" style="s2">herds and all that sort of thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.530" end="00:34:52.280" style="s2">but when I met those two old ladies I</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.629" end="00:34:54.409" style="s2">was just learning they&#39;re like yes and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.280" end="00:34:58.550" style="s2">we are indigenous people from and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.409" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">like ah and but then listen to them for</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.550" end="00:35:01.700" style="s2">a while it&#39;s like this is just like</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:05.869" style="s2">talking to my auntie this is insane you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.700" end="00:35:07.670" style="s2">know this is I feel yeah it was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.869" end="00:35:10.250" style="s2">exactly the same way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.670" end="00:35:11.660" style="s2">relating and being together and and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.250" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">know they just were doing all the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.660" end="00:35:17.750" style="s2">protocols you know that I was doing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:19.609" style="s2">yeah it just blew me away but then it</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.750" end="00:35:20.810" style="s2">made me quite troubled because I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.609" end="00:35:23.300" style="s2">still using that black and white</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.810" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">language before even though I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.300" end="00:35:28.460" style="s2">personally I&#39;m more beige than anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:31.069" style="s2">you know we&#39;re like we still use that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.460" end="00:35:33.050" style="s2">word black a lot like we call us all as</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.069" end="00:35:35.210" style="s2">black fellows you know even though most</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.050" end="00:35:37.160" style="s2">of us as I said in the book we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.210" end="00:35:40.339" style="s2">scrape together enough melanin to scare</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.160" end="00:35:42.619" style="s2">off or taxi anymore um we still use that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.339" end="00:35:44.270" style="s2">language it&#39;s there all and and and some</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.619" end="00:35:45.829" style="s2">of the young people started taking the C</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.270" end="00:35:50.150" style="s2">out of it to make the distinction they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.829" end="00:35:53.089" style="s2">just be Lak kind of thing just try and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.150" end="00:35:55.250" style="s2">make sense it try to have you know why</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.089" end="00:35:57.290" style="s2">we&#39;re saying that because actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.250" end="00:36:01.250" style="s2">offends a lot of like you know African</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.290" end="00:36:02.599" style="s2">people come yeah and those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.250" end="00:36:07.550" style="s2">heaps more pale we&#39;re calling ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.599" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">black and they get really what yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.550" end="00:36:13.700" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s problematic there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">p-word but yeah I just I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.700" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">comfortable with those those terms after</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:20.359" style="s2">that and and I guess one so once I</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">smashed that binary then I started</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.359" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">smashing a lot of other binaries too you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:29.540" style="s2">know ah all of them yeah I must say you</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.550" style="s2">know it resonates with me very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.540" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.550" end="00:36:37.339" style="s2">thought I call it the race swindle right</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:38.980" style="s2">this idea that these alleged races are</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.339" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.980" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">hugely significant in who we are when if</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.990" end="00:36:45.040" style="s2">you actually look much more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:47.260" style="s2">who we really are is what our cultures</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.040" end="00:36:48.970" style="s2">are right and the cultures are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.260" end="00:36:50.650" style="s2">variable you know even in Europe you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.970" end="00:36:52.510" style="s2">know you have your Sami people who you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.650" end="00:36:54.760" style="s2">found as another group which is much</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.510" end="00:36:57.100" style="s2">less well known which are the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.760" end="00:37:00.190" style="s2">Serbs that live on top of a tall</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.100" end="00:37:02.590" style="s2">mountain in Montenegro and they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.190" end="00:37:05.950" style="s2">still tribal people until 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.590" end="00:37:08.200" style="s2">and they still have very strong tribal</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.950" end="00:37:10.900" style="s2">styles of being allowed to know one and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.200" end="00:37:12.760" style="s2">she is you would not want to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.900" end="00:37:16.930" style="s2">fight with her as all I can tell you she</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.760" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">would kick your ass in our he is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.930" end="00:37:21.250" style="s2">still a mountain Serb to the bone even</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:24.100" style="s2">though she lives here in the United</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.250" end="00:37:25.900" style="s2">States and so it&#39;s about our culture I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.100" end="00:37:28.450" style="s2">mean I truthfully over the years have</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.900" end="00:37:30.550" style="s2">come to the conclusion that the actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.450" end="00:37:32.920" style="s2">differences amongst the races are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.550" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">immaterial as not to be even we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.920" end="00:37:38.170" style="s2">thinking about in terms of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:41.230" style="s2">people right but it&#39;s the culture well</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.170" end="00:37:43.600" style="s2">it was an economic classification a real</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.230" end="00:37:45.100" style="s2">I mean originally the race theory is</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.600" end="00:37:46.900" style="s2">just whoever they wanted to make into</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.100" end="00:37:50.230" style="s2">slaves like remember that they had done</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.900" end="00:37:52.060" style="s2">the cottony race and the Irish race and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.230" end="00:37:55.390" style="s2">the Scottish race they had all these</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.060" end="00:37:57.460" style="s2">different races and charts showing the</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.460" end="00:38:01.660" style="s2">more stupid they were you know yeah by</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.650" end="00:38:03.490" style="s2">the Irish that&#39;s Irish were you know we</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.660" end="00:38:05.890" style="s2">were considered the black men of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.490" end="00:38:08.590" style="s2">until quite recently right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.890" end="00:38:10.540" style="s2">well you look at you even Polish people</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.590" end="00:38:14.170" style="s2">in the United States until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.540" end="00:38:16.420" style="s2">were that they were only just included</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.170" end="00:38:18.940" style="s2">in the last few decades as white people</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.420" end="00:38:20.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so weird it just I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.940" end="00:38:24.070" style="s2">just shifts and shifts it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.770" end="00:38:25.630" style="s2">whatever it needs to be to suit the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.070" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">interests of the powerful I think at any</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.630" end="00:38:28.810" style="s2">time and I don&#39;t think we have to buy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.510" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.810" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">yeah I think we should I think we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.510" end="00:38:34.780" style="s2">hundred percent in the same page another</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">interesting historic example is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.780" end="00:38:38.890" style="s2">caste system in India if you dig into</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:41.980" style="s2">the history of it you basically find saw</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.890" end="00:38:43.630" style="s2">prized surprise that each new invader of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.980" end="00:38:45.820" style="s2">North India and that&#39;s really where the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.630" end="00:38:47.770" style="s2">caste system the strongest essentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.820" end="00:38:49.480" style="s2">invented a new caste to sit on top of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.770" end="00:38:51.430" style="s2">the previous castes and North India has</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.480" end="00:38:53.349" style="s2">been conquered again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.430" end="00:38:54.759" style="s2">and essentially the caste</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.349" end="00:38:56.769" style="s2">system is just an institutionalization</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.759" end="00:38:58.509" style="s2">of you know the fact that the new</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.769" end="00:39:00.579" style="s2">invaders are ranked higher than the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.509" end="00:39:02.529" style="s2">previous track of invaders frankly not</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.579" end="00:39:04.930" style="s2">very different than the way the norman</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.529" end="00:39:07.809" style="s2">french invented the idea of the nobility</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.930" end="00:39:09.369" style="s2">to sit on top of the english right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.809" end="00:39:11.289" style="s2">this is a pattern we see over and over</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.369" end="00:39:12.999" style="s2">and over again so this is all very</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.289" end="00:39:14.559" style="s2">interesting let&#39;s move back towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.999" end="00:39:17.109" style="s2">maybe what I would think of as the main</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.559" end="00:39:19.269" style="s2">theme here and that is you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.109" end="00:39:22.839" style="s2">the fact that growth is the engine of</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.269" end="00:39:26.170" style="s2">the city if the growth stops the city</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.839" end="00:39:27.609" style="s2">Falls and as we talked about has</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.170" end="00:39:29.140" style="s2">happened again and again and again you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.609" end="00:39:32.289" style="s2">know the so called Fertile Crescent</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.140" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">ain&#39;t so fertile anymore right and North</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.289" end="00:39:38.440" style="s2">Africa used to be the grain basket of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:40.089" style="s2">the Mediterranean region in our game be</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.440" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">talk we talk about the fact that our</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.089" end="00:39:44.229" style="s2">current system and all systems that have</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:45.849" style="s2">been operating on essentially the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.229" end="00:39:48.579" style="s2">template are essentially self</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.849" end="00:39:50.710" style="s2">terminating and this time you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.579" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">stakes are really high in the past</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.710" end="00:39:54.849" style="s2">because we hadn&#39;t built our stack of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">infrastructure so high</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.849" end="00:39:59.380" style="s2">okay Rome Falls right and fair number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.640" end="00:40:02.469" style="s2">people die but human race doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.380" end="00:40:04.569" style="s2">disappear new German tribes come in and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.469" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2">intermarry with the Romans and life goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.569" end="00:40:09.400" style="s2">on the level of culture Falls quite a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.700" end="00:40:13.180" style="s2">bit literacy the example like to use and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.400" end="00:40:16.299" style="s2">you know 400 AD 60% of the people in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">French city French town were literate by</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.299" end="00:40:22.359" style="s2">600 AD the King of France was illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">so we did lose a lot of culture but most</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.359" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">people survived but in our world with</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.789" style="s2">eight billion soon to be 10 billion</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:30.700" style="s2">people depending on artificial</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.789" end="00:40:32.680" style="s2">fertilizer electricity all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.700" end="00:40:35.650" style="s2">stuff people bad habits need fancy</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.680" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">health care this time the fall is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.650" end="00:40:40.509" style="s2">be ugly you know I might guesstimate is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:42.069" style="s2">the world can only support one to two</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.509" end="00:40:44.440" style="s2">billion people without advanced</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.069" end="00:40:45.759" style="s2">technology so if we&#39;re at ten billion</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.440" end="00:40:49.299" style="s2">when the hits the fan</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.759" end="00:40:51.309" style="s2">do the math not pretty and we got to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.299" end="00:40:54.849" style="s2">find her way out of this self</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.309" end="00:40:56.979" style="s2">terminating trap yeah well I went to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.849" end="00:40:57.999" style="s2">modern monetary theory conference I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.979" end="00:41:01.259" style="s2">to do a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.999" end="00:41:04.269" style="s2">a speech there a few months back and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.259" end="00:41:07.629" style="s2">they&#39;re really they had Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.269" end="00:41:10.689" style="s2">financial advisor there I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.629" end="00:41:12.819" style="s2">her name now yeah and but they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.689" end="00:41:15.399" style="s2">convinced that they can do a soft</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.819" end="00:41:17.619" style="s2">landing using modern modern monetary</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.399" end="00:41:20.739" style="s2">theory they can kick the can down the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.619" end="00:41:22.419" style="s2">road is my guess yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.739" end="00:41:27.399" style="s2">eventually the can goes over the cliff</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.419" end="00:41:30.459" style="s2">you&#39;re surpluses is is my deficit they</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.399" end="00:41:32.379" style="s2">say and that you know you just expand</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.459" end="00:41:33.819" style="s2">the deficit and as long as you know peg</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.379" end="00:41:35.669" style="s2">to another currency you&#39;re right you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.819" end="00:41:37.659" style="s2">just print as much money as you want and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.669" end="00:41:40.629" style="s2">somehow you&#39;ll have all the resources</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.659" end="00:41:42.309" style="s2">you need I don&#39;t know but talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.629" end="00:41:45.339" style="s2">that to fund a green new deal and I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.309" end="00:41:47.619" style="s2">like ah that sounds lovely but it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.339" end="00:41:48.879" style="s2">a bit magical to me as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.619" end="00:41:51.489" style="s2">people are dreaming of a soft landing</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.879" end="00:41:54.569" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think this landings gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.489" end="00:41:55.869" style="s2">too soft this next decade is gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.569" end="00:41:58.089" style="s2">interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.869" end="00:41:59.529" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky you&#39;re in the mountains you</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.459" end="00:42:07.239" style="s2">global warming will actually make our</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.049" end="00:42:09.609" style="s2">land more productive although if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.239" end="00:42:12.339" style="s2">talk to people who went through you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.609" end="00:42:14.619" style="s2">a little a civilization apocalypses in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.339" end="00:42:17.889" style="s2">place like Serbia and Argentina the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.619" end="00:42:19.419" style="s2">people who were really prepped and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.889" end="00:42:21.249" style="s2">sitting on a land out in the countryside</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.419" end="00:42:23.079" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones who were least likely</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.249" end="00:42:25.569" style="s2">to survive because there&#39;s efz of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.079" end="00:42:31.239" style="s2">bandits so I I hope you got a big bunch</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.889" style="s2">story we first bought the farm this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.419" end="00:42:49.449" style="s2">actually interesting and ties in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.889" end="00:42:51.519" style="s2">little bit to some of your other themes</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.449" end="00:42:53.259" style="s2">we&#39;ve done the title search as we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.519" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">typically do under the English common</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.259" end="00:42:57.429" style="s2">law to see the history of the land and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:43:00.099" style="s2">we found quite interesting and extremely</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.429" end="00:43:01.989" style="s2">rare in the United States that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.099" end="00:43:04.919" style="s2">parcel had been settled by one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.989" end="00:43:08.709" style="s2">five original settlers in this area in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.919" end="00:43:10.980" style="s2">1746 and our parcel had been handed down</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.709" end="00:43:12.780" style="s2">father to son</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.980" end="00:43:14.910" style="s2">unbroken for two hundred and twenty</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.780" end="00:43:16.650" style="s2">years that&#39;s a lot that&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.910" end="00:43:18.930" style="s2">generations approximately maybe was</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.650" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">eight generations father-son no break</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.930" end="00:43:23.070" style="s2">and then one of them got a mobile phone</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:26.940" style="s2">and he was finished well a little bit it</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.070" end="00:43:29.609" style="s2">was a different temptation in 1973 the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.940" end="00:43:31.500" style="s2">last one of the family decided like</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.609" end="00:43:34.170" style="s2">drinking more than he liked farming and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.500" end="00:43:35.730" style="s2">so he sold our farm to a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.170" end="00:43:38.460" style="s2">back-to-the-land hippies and it turned</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.730" end="00:43:40.830" style="s2">into a hippie commune and they tried</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.460" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">growing sheep they tried growing corn</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.830" end="00:43:44.850" style="s2">they tried even garlic which is terribly</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:46.980" style="s2">bad idea where we are for various</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.850" end="00:43:49.020" style="s2">reasons and they finally found the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.980" end="00:43:51.330" style="s2">product that they can always sell guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.020" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">what that was reefer right that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.330" end="00:43:55.650" style="s2">place had sort of a dodgy reputation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">so when we bought the place you know a</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.700" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">favorite topics and listen to the show a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.740" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">lot you know we talked about a fair off</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:59.609" style="s2">and it&#39;s the Fermi paradox hey yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:02.130" style="s2">why if there&#39;s aliens why don&#39;t we see</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.660" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">thought that&#39;s one of the 99 arguments</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.109" end="00:45:22.890" style="s2">about the Fermi paradox maybe yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:24.590" style="s2">thought I thought it was my original</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.890" end="00:45:26.630" style="s2">idea that one and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.590" end="00:45:30.080" style="s2">listening to your show and yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.630" end="00:45:32.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s one of the there&#39;s a lot</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.210" end="00:45:36.140" style="s2">yeah the great filter it&#39;s actually one</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.730" end="00:45:38.780" style="s2">version of it&#39;s called the great filter</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.140" end="00:45:40.820" style="s2">argument that was focused and formulated</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.780" end="00:45:44.120" style="s2">by Robin Hanson who we&#39;ve had on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.820" end="00:45:46.700" style="s2">show and this is our argument and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.120" end="00:45:48.830" style="s2">he&#39;s very subtle guy says well you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.700" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">the great filter is either behind us or</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.830" end="00:45:53.000" style="s2">ahead of us right and maybe the great</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:55.190" style="s2">filter is something behind us like the</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.980" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">believe that the great filter is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.570" end="00:46:14.030" style="s2">probably in front of us and that should</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.820" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">and artificial order imposed on</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.160" end="00:47:30.110" style="s2">complexity and then one I had never seen</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.110" end="00:47:36.320" style="s2">narcissism is a very important aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:37.630" style="s2">what&#39;s going on maybe talk about those</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.320" end="00:47:40.030" style="s2">two things</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.630" end="00:47:44.110" style="s2">yeah well you know I mean first of all</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.030" end="00:47:45.960" style="s2">you know I know entropy my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.110" end="00:47:48.370" style="s2">of it as it happens in a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.960" end="00:47:50.620" style="s2">not that such a thing that it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.370" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">to have a closed system but you know so</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.620" end="00:47:55.390" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like this this um</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:58.510" style="s2">there&#39;s this desire in these</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.390" end="00:48:00.370" style="s2">civilizations to to create this order</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.510" end="00:48:02.920" style="s2">this unity this simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.370" end="00:48:06.340" style="s2">you know citizens who think alike on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.920" end="00:48:08.230" style="s2">most issues and you know uniformity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.340" end="00:48:10.180" style="s2">thought word and deed I think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.230" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">the original public school syllabuses</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.180" end="00:48:17.800" style="s2">you know it&#39;s this idea they&#39;re these</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:20.440" style="s2">monocultures you know and just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.800" end="00:48:21.970" style="s2">just their arrogance of that it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.440" end="00:48:22.750" style="s2">is what leads to that I deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.970" end="00:48:26.140" style="s2">narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.750" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">so I AB original cultures basically the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.140" end="00:48:30.460" style="s2">entire culture is a response to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:31.900" style="s2">narcissism it&#39;s a way of holding</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.460" end="00:48:36.370" style="s2">narcissism in check</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.900" end="00:48:38.500" style="s2">it&#39;s of basically stopping these I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.370" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">know what you&#39;d call them assholes or</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.500" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">whatever from running amok and making a</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:45.700" style="s2">mess everywhere but also acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:46.110" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s an asshole from time to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.700" end="00:48:48.280" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.110" end="00:48:51.430" style="s2">everyone&#39;s a narcissist from time to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.280" end="00:48:54.700" style="s2">time it&#39;s a seed in us you know and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.430" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s um it&#39;s basically you know our</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.700" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">social systems our cultures are designed</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.900" style="s2">mostly to hold that in check because</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:05.470" style="s2">when that gets out of balance you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.900" end="00:49:07.300" style="s2">things go wrong you know your society</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.470" end="00:49:11.140" style="s2">breaks down your systems break down your</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.140" end="00:49:15.670" style="s2">you know I guess in game theory terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.210" end="00:49:18.660" style="s2">it&#39;s you know that&#39;s see you get a rise</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.670" end="00:49:21.880" style="s2">in your defectors and your your</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.660" end="00:49:23.770" style="s2">freeloaders and and sociopaths and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.880" end="00:49:26.470" style="s2">predators you know they all come out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.770" end="00:49:28.840" style="s2">this narcissistic idea and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.470" end="00:49:31.930" style="s2">that original sin of that thought I am</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.840" end="00:49:33.250" style="s2">greater than yeah but I really like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.930" end="00:49:35.560" style="s2">I really like that cuz you know what the</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.869" end="00:50:50.130" style="s2">all the time it&#39;s beautiful as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:51.690" style="s2">know I coined that expression I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.130" end="00:50:54.180" style="s2">heard before and it&#39;s now being used</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.690" end="00:50:58.890" style="s2">fair amount as you say I should have</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.180" end="00:51:01.410" style="s2">known it it&#39;s so rutti and hid indeed</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.890" end="00:51:04.349" style="s2">indeed but and I think it is true that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.410" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">we do have a sociopathy problem but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.349" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">think that&#39;s is particular to game a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:11.640" style="s2">hierarchical position based power as</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:12.570" style="s2">opposed to role based leadership which</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.640" end="00:51:14.849" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.570" end="00:51:17.250" style="s2">but I think your idea of narcissism is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.849" end="00:51:20.190" style="s2">actually broader and maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.250" end="00:51:21.839" style="s2">important it truthfully opened my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.190" end="00:51:24.089" style="s2">in an important way and something that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.839" end="00:51:27.089" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try to add into the working</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.089" end="00:51:31.170" style="s2">kit of game be you know not just frankly</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.089" end="00:51:33.869" style="s2">power-mad no empathy people but just the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.170" end="00:51:36.089" style="s2">idea that I am greater and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.869" end="00:51:38.970" style="s2">of people who are relatively mentally</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.089" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">normal who have that as part of their</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.970" end="00:51:43.830" style="s2">operating baggage it&#39;s not that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:45.780" style="s2">you are nothing and I don&#39;t give up</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.830" end="00:51:49.410" style="s2">about your pain which is the sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.780" end="00:51:52.380" style="s2">but just I am greater right greater than</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.410" end="00:51:53.940" style="s2">what why how right and if we can focus</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.380" end="00:51:55.619" style="s2">on that I mean you know I would say of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.940" end="00:51:57.810" style="s2">all the learnings I personally made and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.619" end="00:52:02.580" style="s2">there was a lot reading this book this</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.810" end="00:52:04.470" style="s2">idea of narcissism as this concept of I</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.580" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">am greater it had some other valence as</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.470" end="00:52:07.540" style="s2">to that was the core</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:09.460" style="s2">one I thought was hugely important one</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.540" end="00:52:11.950" style="s2">of things I found very interesting was</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.460" end="00:52:14.440" style="s2">that you said that the elders the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.950" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">knowledge keepers if they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.440" end="00:52:19.030" style="s2">work with you and talk with you you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:21.130" style="s2">and with you as you talked about we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.030" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">talk about what&#39;s a yarn next but that</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.130" end="00:52:26.860" style="s2">these elders these wisdom keepers will</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:28.810" style="s2">withdraw if they sense narcissism in you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.860" end="00:52:31.180" style="s2">and it would seem to me if that could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.810" end="00:52:33.190" style="s2">built into the game be culture or any</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.180" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">operating system culture that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.190" end="00:52:37.150" style="s2">damn good thing yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:39.820" style="s2">universal too because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.150" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">mentioned in the book that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.820" end="00:52:43.810" style="s2">was I was talking to a Native American</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:46.030" style="s2">physicist at the Perimeter you Institute</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.810" end="00:52:47.560" style="s2">yeah I just I&#39;d come into that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.030" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">conversation completely the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.560" end="00:52:52.840" style="s2">and you know I was I don&#39;t know I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:56.620" style="s2">distracted and I think I was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.840" end="00:53:00.130" style="s2">narcissistic and he did that he just he</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.620" end="00:53:02.380" style="s2">kind of iced me in the end you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.130" end="00:53:04.420" style="s2">I thought ah I can&#39;t say he&#39;s politely</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.380" end="00:53:08.500" style="s2">shut it down I&#39;ve gone the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.420" end="00:53:09.940" style="s2">here you know yeah and you just accept</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.500" end="00:53:12.220" style="s2">that and then you learn the lesson and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.940" end="00:53:14.860" style="s2">move on and I think that&#39;s the the big</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.220" end="00:53:17.290" style="s2">thing with our culture too is that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.860" end="00:53:21.730" style="s2">know you&#39;re happy to get a rebuke or a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.290" end="00:53:25.240" style="s2">punishment or even an ordeal like a real</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.730" end="00:53:27.550" style="s2">ordeal because it transforms you you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.240" end="00:53:30.310" style="s2">know and then after after you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.550" end="00:53:32.440" style="s2">punished that&#39;s it the crimes done you</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.310" end="00:53:34.180" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t carry that around in</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.440" end="00:53:36.580" style="s2">your reputation forever it&#39;s finished</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.180" end="00:53:38.470" style="s2">everyone forgets it you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.580" end="00:53:40.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a beautiful idea for</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.470" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">anybody&#39;s justice system as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.450" end="00:53:45.130" style="s2">but the narcissism is dealt with like</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:48.010" style="s2">early on because your life is in almost</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.130" end="00:53:51.430" style="s2">in these 15 years sort of segments and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.010" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">you go through sort of four periods of</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.430" end="00:53:55.960" style="s2">ordeal before you can become a real man</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:58.180" style="s2">you know and it kind of happens every 15</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.960" end="00:54:00.660" style="s2">years or so and so I guess the first one</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.180" end="00:54:02.980" style="s2">happens for men and women you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.660" end="00:54:06.070" style="s2">around the age of 1415</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.980" end="00:54:08.560" style="s2">you know you go through that that rite</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.070" end="00:54:12.130" style="s2">of passage that ritual of ordeal and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.560" end="00:54:13.840" style="s2">you experience terror and pain and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.130" end="00:54:16.270" style="s2">of other sort of secret things I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.840" end="00:54:18.280" style="s2">go into but basically the upside is you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.270" end="00:54:20.170" style="s2">learn a very important lesson the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.280" end="00:54:24.010" style="s2">important lesson in the world which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.170" end="00:54:26.440" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m not special it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.010" end="00:54:29.470" style="s2">important to know you&#39;re not special and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.440" end="00:54:31.990" style="s2">it&#39;s devastating it&#39;s devastating at</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.470" end="00:54:34.120" style="s2">first but then there&#39;s like a series of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.990" end="00:54:36.370" style="s2">cascading realizations that come off</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.120" end="00:54:38.380" style="s2">that because eventually you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.370" end="00:54:40.930" style="s2">well actually that means no one else is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.380" end="00:54:42.940" style="s2">special either and so that that feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.930" end="00:54:44.770" style="s2">makes you feel a bit better and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.940" end="00:54:46.360" style="s2">you can sort of start to see a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.770" end="00:54:49.000" style="s2">governance model coming out of that if</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.360" end="00:54:51.130" style="s2">nobody&#39;s particularly special then this</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.000" end="00:54:54.010" style="s2">is sort of heterotic imperative there</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.130" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">but then you have more you understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.010" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">then ah but we we belong to something</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.160" end="00:55:01.930" style="s2">special all of us together we belong to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:04.390" style="s2">something special you know we&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.930" end="00:55:07.330" style="s2">custodia species you know we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.390" end="00:55:09.160" style="s2">people who belong here and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.330" end="00:55:11.350" style="s2">beautiful way to live because it just</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.160" end="00:55:13.270" style="s2">crushes the narcissism in you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.350" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">not going into some kind of high of mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.270" end="00:55:19.330" style="s2">or commune or anything like that because</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:20.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that you know um you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.330" end="00:55:22.900" style="s2">you&#39;re indigenous identity is really</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.830" end="00:55:25.300" style="s2">strongly individualistic you you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.900" end="00:55:27.400" style="s2">bit of a show-off you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.300" end="00:55:29.230" style="s2">important to remain as distinct as</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.400" end="00:55:31.630" style="s2">possible from those who are most similar</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.230" end="00:55:33.310" style="s2">to you you know you you are an</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.630" end="00:55:35.950" style="s2">individual but at the same time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.310" end="00:55:38.830" style="s2">profoundly interconnected and related</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:41.380" style="s2">and interdependent with everybody around</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.830" end="00:55:42.180" style="s2">you there&#39;s a very fluid self other</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.380" end="00:55:44.500" style="s2">boundary</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.180" end="00:55:46.420" style="s2">yeah I like that a lot a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.500" end="00:55:48.700" style="s2">to talk about here you know you know we</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.420" end="00:55:50.560" style="s2">talk about you&#39;re not special of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.700" end="00:55:53.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of a stereotype else I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.560" end="00:55:55.420" style="s2">it&#39;s actually fully true but like many</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.590" end="00:55:57.790" style="s2">stereotypes are some you know hint of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.420" end="00:56:00.550" style="s2">truth to it we talk about Millennials in</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.740" end="00:56:32.980" style="s2">here in the West may have produced a</p>

<p begin="00:57:04.300" end="00:57:08.740" style="s2">the you know the inflammatory situation</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:10.570" style="s2">of social media and the feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.740" end="00:57:12.940" style="s2">and the signals you get to produce more</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.570" end="00:57:17.560" style="s2">narcissism that does not sound good to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.940" end="00:57:20.530" style="s2">me no but I mean but any any threat like</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.560" end="00:57:22.600" style="s2">that that arises in a system will will</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.530" end="00:57:24.070" style="s2">spark the creation of its opposite</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.600" end="00:57:26.080" style="s2">somewhere else in that system you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.070" end="00:57:28.180" style="s2">so like you say you know you have those</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.080" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">kind of disconnected Millennials some</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.180" end="00:57:32.500" style="s2">popping up but then you know straight</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:34.180" style="s2">away then you have that agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.500" end="00:57:37.470" style="s2">community you&#39;re talking about which you</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.180" end="00:57:40.420" style="s2">know is very connected people and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.470" end="00:57:42.640" style="s2">yeah well a great example here of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.420" end="00:57:45.550" style="s2">young Millennials in our area were lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.640" end="00:57:47.770" style="s2">of farms there was five farms that were</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.550" end="00:57:50.230" style="s2">being run by young hard-charging</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.770" end="00:57:53.050" style="s2">Millennials to service the high-end</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.230" end="00:57:54.910" style="s2">restaurant community over an hour away</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.050" end="00:57:56.290" style="s2">but you know they were driving their</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.910" end="00:57:58.180" style="s2">produce over there and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.290" end="00:58:01.630" style="s2">pandemic comes all the fine-dining</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.180" end="00:58:03.730" style="s2">restaurants closed so they are adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.630" end="00:58:06.940" style="s2">they pull together and quickly build a</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.730" end="00:58:09.250" style="s2">website and offer all this unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.940" end="00:58:12.490" style="s2">nice produce to people to regular</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.250" end="00:58:14.890" style="s2">end-user consumers and we now subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.490" end="00:58:16.930" style="s2">to them and once a week we drive down to</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.890" end="00:58:19.120" style="s2">the kind of the central farm of the five</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.930" end="00:58:20.530" style="s2">farms and they aggregate all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.120" end="00:58:23.020" style="s2">from the five farms that we&#39;ve ordered</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.530" end="00:58:25.450" style="s2">online and then we drive down press the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.020" end="00:58:27.400" style="s2">button open the tailgate on the SUV they</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.450" end="00:58:29.770" style="s2">load the stuff into our cooler and off</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.400" end="00:58:32.050" style="s2">we go it&#39;s the exact opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.770" end="00:58:34.090" style="s2">narcissism they figured out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.050" end="00:58:35.260" style="s2">something work quite interesting now the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.090" end="00:58:37.150" style="s2">other thing I want to jump to it</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.260" end="00:58:40.359" style="s2">in my notes further ahead but I thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.150" end="00:58:42.460" style="s2">was a very important point very</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.359" end="00:58:44.740" style="s2">important and as one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.460" end="00:58:47.470" style="s2">the West especially the most current</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.740" end="00:58:50.430" style="s2">West is up is this business about</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.470" end="00:58:53.109" style="s2">your criminal record right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.430" end="00:58:56.380" style="s2">permanently disabling you tell a couple</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.109" end="00:58:59.050" style="s2">of personal stories here one I was a bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.380" end="00:59:01.720" style="s2">boy when I was young is that shocking</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.050" end="00:59:04.570" style="s2">probably not I was thrown in jail three</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.720" end="00:59:06.790" style="s2">times I got a criminal record right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.570" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">I got caught once for something really</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.790" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">bad and got out of it but I find the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:13.630" style="s2">most unbelievable good luck imaginable</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">which I&#39;m not gonna get into but in my</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.630" end="00:59:19.300" style="s2">day it wasn&#39;t such a big deal nobody the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">databases didn&#39;t exist they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.300" end="00:59:23.650" style="s2">find out you know and it just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:25.030" style="s2">something that&#39;s done I suspect I would</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.650" end="00:59:27.970" style="s2">have had a hard time having the good</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.030" end="00:59:30.460" style="s2">career I did today with some stupid ass</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.970" end="00:59:32.890" style="s2"> 19 year old on my</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.460" end="00:59:35.230" style="s2">record right and that&#39;s really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.890" end="00:59:36.760" style="s2">right and I can go even deeper store and</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.230" end="00:59:40.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the truth of this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.760" end="00:59:44.380" style="s2">but I suspect that it is exactly this my</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.210" end="00:59:46.980" style="s2">mother&#39;s father is a mystery man he grew</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.380" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">up in a town in northern Wisconsin</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.980" end="00:59:50.950" style="s2">fought in World War one traveled around</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:52.869" style="s2">the world as a merchant marine and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.950" end="00:59:55.320" style="s2">showed up in place where my mother is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.869" end="00:59:57.780" style="s2">from very far in northern Minnesota and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.320" end="00:59:59.710" style="s2">just showed up there one day and</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.780" end="01:00:02.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t tell anybody really where he</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.710" end="01:00:05.260" style="s2">came from he never left the county again</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.230" end="01:00:08.140" style="s2">for 30 years never spoke of his family</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.260" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">etc and we figure he was essentially on</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.140" end="01:00:13.240" style="s2">the run from some misdeed probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:15.700" style="s2">criminal and yet in those days easy</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.240" end="01:00:17.380" style="s2">enough just move right and behave</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.700" end="01:00:19.210" style="s2">yourself and go on with your life and he</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.380" end="01:00:20.950" style="s2">had a reasonably productive life he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.210" end="01:00:22.840" style="s2">an eccentric individual say the least</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.950" end="01:00:26.590" style="s2">but he was able to have a normal life</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.840" end="01:00:30.550" style="s2">had nine kids etc and this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.590" end="01:00:31.720" style="s2">people are stigmatized for ever by</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.550" end="01:00:34.060" style="s2">something for which they have received</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.720" end="01:00:35.890" style="s2">their just punishment for strikes me is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.060" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">very up and actually one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.890" end="01:00:41.290" style="s2">bases of some of the black/white racial</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.960" style="s2">problems in the United States right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.290" end="01:00:45.910" style="s2">I really do like this idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.960" end="01:00:48.550" style="s2">should go back to wait even used to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.910" end="01:00:49.180" style="s2">in the United States until 4050 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.550" end="01:00:51.220" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.180" end="01:00:53.500" style="s2">that hey you done your time you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.220" end="01:00:55.569" style="s2">free man you&#39;re a citizen again let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.500" end="01:00:56.550" style="s2">just forget about that and go forth and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.569" end="01:00:59.410" style="s2">sin no more</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.550" end="01:01:01.720" style="s2">that&#39;s it I mean it&#39;s I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.410" end="01:01:03.160" style="s2">just seems pretty simple to me but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.720" end="01:01:05.109" style="s2">mean you have to make sure that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.160" end="01:01:07.690" style="s2">ordeal is transforming the person though</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.109" end="01:01:10.089" style="s2">we can&#39;t be fioor it&#39;s hard to tell</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.690" end="01:01:13.869" style="s2">alright well I think for some things you</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.089" end="01:01:15.880" style="s2">want some degree of certainty like um I</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.869" end="01:01:18.490" style="s2">think some people probably need to lose</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.880" end="01:01:21.630" style="s2">their junk before they&#39;re unleashed back</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.490" end="01:01:25.300" style="s2">into the community you know for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.630" end="01:01:26.589" style="s2">yeah but you it has to be some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.300" end="01:01:28.329" style="s2">ordeal that they go through that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.589" end="01:01:30.910" style="s2">actually transforms them and changes</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.329" end="01:01:33.280" style="s2">them and some people who are wise enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.910" end="01:01:35.800" style="s2">to to see that that has happened it</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.280" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">can&#39;t just be you know yeah I I&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.800" end="01:01:41.170" style="s2">Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.640" end="01:01:43.780" style="s2">you know reading the Bible now so can</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.170" end="01:01:46.270" style="s2">you let me out early because you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.780" end="01:01:47.980" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ve seen enough movies to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.270" end="01:01:50.349" style="s2">know that that&#39;s half the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.980" end="01:01:52.839" style="s2">you know but look I think all this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.349" end="01:01:55.869" style="s2">coming out of this some obsession with</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.839" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">safety and security in this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.869" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a human right to be safe you know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:04.210" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s such a new</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:07.119" style="s2">idea like so when you&#39;re growing up as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.210" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">kid you run around with a knife on your</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.119" end="01:02:10.780" style="s2">belt and all these sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:13.150" style="s2">that was just normal like five minutes</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.780" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">ago you know but now I mean I know</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.150" end="01:02:20.049" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a oh it&#39;s Ness is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:21.400" style="s2">illegal you&#39;ve got to get fine for that</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.049" end="01:02:24.520" style="s2">because we&#39;ve got to keep everybody safe</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.400" end="01:02:27.040" style="s2">you might lose an eye that&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.520" end="01:02:28.630" style="s2">just awful see we don&#39;t have we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.040" end="01:02:30.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have a word for safety in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.630" end="01:02:31.869" style="s2">Aboriginal languages and every algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.460" end="01:02:34.390" style="s2">language I&#39;ve seen there&#39;s no word for</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.869" end="01:02:36.549" style="s2">safety there are words for protection</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.390" end="01:02:38.619" style="s2">though and protection is a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.549" end="01:02:42.549" style="s2">different thing because protection has</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.619" end="01:02:44.770" style="s2">agency as part of it you know your</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.549" end="01:02:46.930" style="s2">protection is your responsibility then</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.770" end="01:02:50.079" style="s2">you have agency in assuring your safety</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.930" end="01:02:51.430" style="s2">but also in in our communities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.079" end="01:02:53.500" style="s2">not just responsible for your own</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.430" end="01:02:55.720" style="s2">protection but the protection active</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.500" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">protection not just passive safety of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.720" end="01:02:59.810" style="s2">the all the people around you</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:01.700" style="s2">and so that means that you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.810" end="01:03:04.730" style="s2">their back they&#39;re watching your back</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.700" end="01:03:07.550" style="s2">you know and in a group you you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.730" end="01:03:10.220" style="s2">protected and there&#39;s power in that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.550" end="01:03:11.780" style="s2">that power has been taken away you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.220" end="01:03:13.790" style="s2">and I guess that&#39;s where if we talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.780" end="01:03:15.290" style="s2">about violence later looks like enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.790" end="01:03:18.590" style="s2">to be another episode the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.290" end="01:03:20.270" style="s2">going but you know the agency of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.590" end="01:03:22.310" style="s2">violence has been taken away and</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.270" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">monopolized and concentrated into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.310" end="01:03:27.730" style="s2">hands of a few people and you know you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:31.490" style="s2">see how badly that goes pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.730" end="01:03:33.140" style="s2">lately especially you know if that</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.490" end="01:03:35.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out too well for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.140" end="01:03:37.370" style="s2">like everything else in in a complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.540" end="01:03:38.870" style="s2">system you know violence needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.370" end="01:03:41.090" style="s2">something that&#39;s distributed throughout</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.870" end="01:03:43.460" style="s2">this system and you need lots of agents</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.090" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">who are capable of using it and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.460" end="01:03:47.290" style="s2">if there&#39;s any group that&#39;s denied</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:49.640" style="s2">access to the agency of violence then</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.290" end="01:03:51.890" style="s2">you know that that groups not going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.640" end="01:03:53.570" style="s2">have a particularly good time yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.890" end="01:03:55.430" style="s2">talk about this one maybe this will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.570" end="01:03:57.770" style="s2">one of our last topics for this first</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.430" end="01:03:59.750" style="s2">session to our listeners Tyson I have</p>

<p begin="01:04:01.310" end="01:04:05.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna not try to jam it all</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.530" end="01:04:07.370" style="s2">into one 90-minute episode and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.390" end="01:04:08.930" style="s2">gonna come back and do a part two you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.370" end="01:04:11.060" style="s2">know I&#39;m my podcast I&#39;ve talked quite a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.930" end="01:04:13.070" style="s2">bit about when I was a kid I kept the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.060" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">knife in my pocket from literally age</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.070" end="01:04:17.390" style="s2">eight right that&#39;s just what we did you</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:20.120" style="s2">know my senior year in high school sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.390" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">of a almost mandatory part of manly</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.120" end="01:04:25.070" style="s2">dress was to have a folding buck knife</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.990" style="s2">you know a big hunting knife on your</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.070" end="01:04:30.920" style="s2">belt in a leather scabbard</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.990" end="01:04:33.890" style="s2">could you imagine today if 50% of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.920" end="01:04:36.230" style="s2">seniors at a high school showed up with</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.890" end="01:04:38.420" style="s2">big old buck knives on their belt they</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.230" end="01:04:41.390" style="s2">call out the National Guard probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.420" end="01:04:44.090" style="s2">right in the end of the world if I what</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.390" end="01:04:45.590" style="s2">the hell right revolution and then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.090" end="01:04:47.810" style="s2">other one again is one of my pet peeves</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.590" end="01:04:50.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I resonated with what you</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.810" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">wrote about violence you know V word or</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.360" end="01:04:54.440" style="s2">is you know considered so bad by so many</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:57.440" style="s2">people when I was a kid everybody fought</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.440" end="01:04:59.600" style="s2">all boys fought and a non-trivial number</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.440" end="01:05:01.190" style="s2">of girls fought you know it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.600" end="01:05:03.800" style="s2">really matter frankly if you won or lost</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.190" end="01:05:05.480" style="s2">right and some people were better</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.800" end="01:05:09.260" style="s2">fighters than others but having the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.480" end="01:05:12.050" style="s2">heart to fight was a key part of being a</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.260" end="01:05:12.530" style="s2">person in our community and as you say</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.050" end="01:05:14.330" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.530" end="01:05:16.550" style="s2">essentially was almost like a cayenne it</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.330" end="01:05:18.470" style="s2">was a protective measure that any group</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.550" end="01:05:20.840" style="s2">of us knew we all knew how to take care</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.470" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">of ourselves and so it was a group of us</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.840" end="01:05:24.320" style="s2">we run it a group of others whoever</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:26.510" style="s2">those were we weren&#39;t too concerned</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.320" end="01:05:29.360" style="s2">about it we weren&#39;t overreacting we</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.510" end="01:05:30.650" style="s2">weren&#39;t anxious etc because we all knew</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.360" end="01:05:32.360" style="s2">how to take care of ourselves we all</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.650" end="01:05:33.980" style="s2">been punched a few times we knew that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.360" end="01:05:35.540" style="s2">the world does not end if you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.980" end="01:05:38.360" style="s2">punched in the face a couple of times</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.540" end="01:05:40.160" style="s2">he&#39;s as Christ right but today kids</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.360" end="01:05:42.620" style="s2">fight in school and literally they call</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.160" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">the police what the hell if you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.620" end="01:05:46.100" style="s2">anything about young mammals</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:49.580" style="s2">particularly male mammals they all play</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.100" end="01:05:51.500" style="s2">fight spar etc and we had what I called</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.580" end="01:05:53.510" style="s2">the code of Adelphi which is the town I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.500" end="01:05:56.840" style="s2">grew up in which there was definitely</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.510" end="01:05:58.670" style="s2">unwritten rules for fighting within the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.840" end="01:06:00.770" style="s2">in-group which is you never kick</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.670" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">somebody when they&#39;re on the ground you</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.770" end="01:06:05.840" style="s2">know you never you never tore ears you</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:07.670" style="s2">never went for the eyes you know you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.840" end="01:06:09.800" style="s2">never kick somebody in the balls well</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.670" end="01:06:11.900" style="s2">enough provocation maybe but that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.800" end="01:06:14.660" style="s2">the outer limits but and nobody I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.900" end="01:06:16.790" style="s2">got knocked out right collarbones got</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.660" end="01:06:18.650" style="s2">broken occasionally but oh well right</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.790" end="01:06:20.660" style="s2">but there was never any serious damage</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.650" end="01:06:23.540" style="s2">but guess what we did not have in those</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.660" end="01:06:25.610" style="s2">days school shootings the thought was</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.540" end="01:06:27.260" style="s2">just unthinkable you know you had a</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.610" end="01:06:29.180" style="s2">problem with somebody we went underneath</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.260" end="01:06:31.370" style="s2">the the pear tree and you had it out</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.180" end="01:06:33.290" style="s2">right well in how many how many</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.370" end="01:06:36.980" style="s2">hospitalizations do you remember from</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.290" end="01:06:38.690" style="s2">those fights 0 right 0 no zero overnight</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.980" end="01:06:40.840" style="s2">you know again maybe you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.690" end="01:06:43.310" style="s2">your collarbone set or something but no</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.840" end="01:06:44.900" style="s2">hospitalizations overnight yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.310" end="01:06:47.060" style="s2">it but but it&#39;s not like that now</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.900" end="01:06:49.730" style="s2">because the kids don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.060" end="01:06:51.890" style="s2">those codes of conflict because you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.730" end="01:06:53.990" style="s2">all violence is bad so it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.890" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">allowed so they don&#39;t understand the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.990" end="01:06:57.380" style="s2">codes and the rules and when the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:06:59.660" style="s2">violence erupts in the school I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.380" end="01:07:01.130" style="s2">they they they&#39;re getting someone on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.660" end="01:07:02.600" style="s2">ground and stomping on their head and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.130" end="01:07:05.240" style="s2">trying to kill them that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.600" end="01:07:06.800" style="s2">horrendous damage you know so now when</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.240" end="01:07:10.040" style="s2">fights happened they&#39;re they&#39;re horribly</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.800" end="01:07:12.650" style="s2">violent terribly damaging and as I said</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.040" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">we all carry knives but it was at be an</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.650" end="01:07:18.050" style="s2">absolute violation of the code to ever</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:20.900" style="s2">produce a knife in a fight amongst your</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.050" end="01:07:23.960" style="s2">peers right it was not even thinkable</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.900" end="01:07:25.370" style="s2">truthfully it was so deeply engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.960" end="01:07:26.410" style="s2">the culture and if someone had you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.370" end="01:07:28.480" style="s2">the group would have just John</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.410" end="01:07:29.950" style="s2">then and beating their ass right but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:31.480" style="s2">literally never saw it happen and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.950" end="01:07:33.700" style="s2">probably a hundred fights that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.480" end="01:07:35.890" style="s2">witnessed that anyone produced a knife</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.700" end="01:07:37.720" style="s2">even though probably 80% of them had a</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.890" end="01:07:40.210" style="s2">knife on their person just wasn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.720" end="01:07:43.869" style="s2">I&#39;m in a strong agreement that this</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.210" end="01:07:46.299" style="s2">attempt to make life safe and padded</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.869" end="01:07:48.640" style="s2">with foam and particularly young males</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.299" end="01:07:50.980" style="s2">not being allowed at all to fight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.640" end="01:07:52.780" style="s2">just terrible in multiple levels you</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.980" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">can&#39;t really become a fully integrated</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.780" end="01:07:57.579" style="s2">person that violence is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:08:01.030" style="s2">sublimated not having been articulated</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.579" end="01:08:02.859" style="s2">in a code right a cultural norms as you</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.030" end="01:08:04.720" style="s2">say instead of you know standing up and</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.859" end="01:08:07.630" style="s2">sparring with your hands all right you</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.720" end="01:08:10.240" style="s2">know no big deal honor was made by both</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.630" end="01:08:12.250" style="s2">parties nobody was hurt too bad you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.240" end="01:08:14.349" style="s2">instead without that kind of contact</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.250" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">finally you know the person that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.349" end="01:08:18.790" style="s2">persecuted snaps and you know brings a</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.719" end="01:08:20.529" style="s2">baseball bat to school and almost kill</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.790" end="01:08:21.819" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s what we have instead or</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.529" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">we&#39;re still there bringing a gun to</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.819" end="01:08:28.449" style="s2">school and I was very intrigued actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:29.949" style="s2">at your the again come to the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.449" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">from a very different perspective from</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.949" end="01:08:35.469" style="s2">the perspective of your culture that hey</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:38.980" style="s2">you know violence does have a place but</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.469" end="01:08:43.299" style="s2">it needs to be acculturated hmm well</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.980" end="01:08:45.699" style="s2">it&#39;s it demands expression and you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.299" end="01:08:47.529" style="s2">so we have this idea of the you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.699" end="01:08:49.690" style="s2">the euro big power or big spirit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.529" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">in your belly and that mental illness</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.690" end="01:08:54.940" style="s2">comes from allowing things to build up</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:56.380" style="s2">there you know negative emotions and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.940" end="01:08:58.660" style="s2">things like that so you have to give</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.380" end="01:09:01.089" style="s2">them expression immediately you know if</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.660" end="01:09:03.250" style="s2">you&#39;re angry you yell it and if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.089" end="01:09:05.230" style="s2">it&#39;s you know a big transgression and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.250" end="01:09:07.900" style="s2">you&#39;re very angry about it then then you</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.230" end="01:09:09.429" style="s2">have to fight you have to fight the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.900" end="01:09:12.370" style="s2">person that&#39;s transgressed against you</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.429" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">but it has to be public it has to be</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:18.339" style="s2">the rules because the crowd will stop</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.810" end="01:09:20.500" style="s2">you you know straight up you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.339" end="01:09:21.969" style="s2">pulling here you&#39;re not hitting already</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.500" end="01:09:24.219" style="s2">anybody when they&#39;re on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.969" end="01:09:27.580" style="s2">you&#39;re not kicking you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.219" end="01:09:29.259" style="s2">both straight just boxing you know you</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.580" end="01:09:33.069" style="s2">know they say every fight like I keep</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.259" end="01:09:34.630" style="s2">hearing these Americans saying you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.069" end="01:09:36.819" style="s2">every fight always ends up on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.630" end="01:09:38.529" style="s2">not for us they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.819" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">on the ground if someone falls he wait</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.529" end="01:09:43.060" style="s2">until they get up again episode was true</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:44.469" style="s2">in my community as well now there was</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.060" end="01:09:47.319" style="s2">actually two kinds of fighting there was</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.469" end="01:09:49.389" style="s2">this call it ritualistic fighting where</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.319" end="01:09:51.569" style="s2">you stand and throw punches right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.389" end="01:09:54.429" style="s2">then there was the very much rarer</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.569" end="01:09:55.840" style="s2">really serious grudge fight</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.429" end="01:09:57.969" style="s2">which case people would go to the ground</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.840" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">but that was a different thing and there</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.969" end="01:10:02.230" style="s2">was also what I would call fighting with</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">others you know outside of our community</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.230" end="01:10:06.969" style="s2">in which case you modulated the level of</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:08.650" style="s2">violence based on an assessment of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.969" end="01:10:10.420" style="s2">risk and you might well go to the ground</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.650" end="01:10:12.429" style="s2">but there was a big distinction you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.420" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">cultural ceremonial fighting was always</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.429" end="01:10:16.540" style="s2">done standing and with your hands it</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:19.000" style="s2">sounds very similar I&#39;m working on a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.540" end="01:10:21.639" style="s2">research project at the moment actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.000" end="01:10:23.860" style="s2">it says it&#39;s a study myself and another</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.639" end="01:10:27.340" style="s2">indigenous researcher where I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.860" end="01:10:30.219" style="s2">study on settler on settler violence and</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.340" end="01:10:33.690" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking at like our data set is</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.219" end="01:10:35.889" style="s2">a hundred YouTube street fight videos of</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.690" end="01:10:37.780" style="s2">settlers fighting in different settler</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.889" end="01:10:40.690" style="s2">states around the world so you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.780" end="01:10:44.349" style="s2">Taiwan Israel New Zealand Australia</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.690" end="01:10:46.929" style="s2">Canada and the US there&#39;s heaps there</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.349" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">yeah and we&#39;re applying a heuristic of</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.929" end="01:10:50.079" style="s2">indigenous rule-governed violence so</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.400" end="01:10:53.469" style="s2">we&#39;re taking our fighting rules and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.079" end="01:10:56.560" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re judging the settler fights</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.469" end="01:10:58.630" style="s2">are based on our rules it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:11:01.590" style="s2">a cheeky reverse anthropology thing I</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.630" end="01:11:04.929" style="s2">like it but we&#39;re finding governance is</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.590" end="01:11:06.099" style="s2">it&#39;s almost non-existent in these fights</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.929" end="01:11:07.989" style="s2">and it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.099" end="01:11:10.000" style="s2">you know like one of our biggest rules</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.989" end="01:11:11.860" style="s2">is there&#39;s no collateral damage you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.000" end="01:11:13.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t do anything that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.860" end="01:11:16.659" style="s2">injure the crowd but this so much of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.800" end="01:11:18.909" style="s2">innocent bystanders getting taken out</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.659" end="01:11:19.480" style="s2">and all these sorts of things yes quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.909" end="01:11:20.980" style="s2">a renders</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.480" end="01:11:22.780" style="s2">but what we&#39;re finding really horrendous</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.980" end="01:11:25.480" style="s2">is when there is some attempt at</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.780" end="01:11:28.060" style="s2">governance it&#39;s usually by women but</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.480" end="01:11:31.420" style="s2">that women are absolutely prohibited in</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.060" end="01:11:33.730" style="s2">all hundred cases women are absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.420" end="01:11:36.849" style="s2">prohibited from participating as</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.730" end="01:11:38.860" style="s2">combatants that that&#39;s an absolute no-no</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.849" end="01:11:41.230" style="s2">and see it&#39;s the opposite if you look up</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.860" end="01:11:43.119" style="s2">indigenous five videos most of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.230" end="01:11:46.550" style="s2">five videos will be women</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.119" end="01:11:50.780" style="s2">fighting you know so our women do fight</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.550" end="01:11:53.780" style="s2">and naturally human women do you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.780" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s only these civilized women who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.780" end="01:11:58.070" style="s2">prevented from fighting they&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:12:01.639" style="s2">the groups that are denied access to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.070" end="01:12:04.519" style="s2">agency of violence you know so you see</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.639" end="01:12:06.260" style="s2">even like men who look like big in a big</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.519" end="01:12:08.059" style="s2">melee a whole heap of men just</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.260" end="01:12:09.709" style="s2">struggling together furiously trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.059" end="01:12:12.199" style="s2">kill each other like they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.709" end="01:12:14.119" style="s2">going berserk and then a woman will</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.199" end="01:12:15.800" style="s2">start fighting off to the side and all</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.119" end="01:12:19.070" style="s2">the men on both sides will stop and join</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.800" end="01:12:21.709" style="s2">forces and just stop her for her we saw</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.070" end="01:12:23.510" style="s2">this time and time again the the only</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.709" end="01:12:25.400" style="s2">role a woman&#39;s allowed to perform us to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.510" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">sort of you know try and break the fight</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.400" end="01:12:28.999" style="s2">up and go don&#39;t touch him</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:30.860" style="s2">okay that sort of thing you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.999" end="01:12:32.809" style="s2">screaming from the sidelines you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.860" end="01:12:35.269" style="s2">the one yes so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.809" end="01:12:37.039" style="s2">yielding some interesting results but</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.269" end="01:12:39.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s the gendered nature of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.039" end="01:12:40.999" style="s2">some this problem with with violence in</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.380" end="01:12:42.920" style="s2">this imbalance that&#39;s kind of disturbing</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.999" end="01:12:46.159" style="s2">and I do touch on that in the book like</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.920" end="01:12:49.659" style="s2">I feel I feel that Western femininity is</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.159" end="01:12:52.550" style="s2">a you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.659" end="01:12:54.709" style="s2">you know projected as this universal</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.550" end="01:12:57.590" style="s2">femininity that this is what feminine is</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.709" end="01:12:59.179" style="s2">but it&#39;s not that&#39;s what any person</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.590" end="01:13:01.010" style="s2">who&#39;s completely confined and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.179" end="01:13:02.989" style="s2">disempowered from their for their whole</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.010" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">life that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to act</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.989" end="01:13:05.630" style="s2">they&#39;re going to mince around and</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:08.539" style="s2">they&#39;re going to throw like a girl</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.630" end="01:13:10.280" style="s2">you know this through indigenous women</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.539" end="01:13:12.440" style="s2">don&#39;t throw like a girl it throw like a</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.280" end="01:13:16.010" style="s2">human exactly the same way that men</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.440" end="01:13:18.650" style="s2">throw you know so I mean this is quite a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.010" end="01:13:20.809" style="s2">cloistered life where these poor women</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.650" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">are at or to occupy less space than</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.809" end="01:13:26.539" style="s2">males and all the rest you know it it um</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:26.869" style="s2">it ends up with women in this weakened</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.539" end="01:13:29.329" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.869" end="01:13:31.550" style="s2">and they&#39;re basically at the mercy of of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.329" end="01:13:35.670" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s around and that&#39;s um I</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.550" end="01:13:38.489" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t like that too much</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.670" end="01:13:40.380" style="s2">yeah you know like word I use as overly</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.489" end="01:13:43.139" style="s2">domesticated I mean it quite literally</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.380" end="01:13:45.330" style="s2">in the same way that a cow is kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.139" end="01:13:48.929" style="s2">stupid and weak version of a buffalo</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.330" end="01:13:50.580" style="s2">right yeah and yes women were overly</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.929" end="01:13:52.980" style="s2">domestic especially in the West you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.580" end="01:13:54.659" style="s2">think of the Victorian or early 20th</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.980" end="01:13:56.850" style="s2">century woman in particular you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.659" end="01:13:58.320" style="s2">well any civilization was I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.850" end="01:14:01.020" style="s2">the same with in Asia</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.320" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">yeah the foot-binding things like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.020" end="01:14:06.389" style="s2">yeah Middle East as well you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:08.960" style="s2">anywhere anywhere civilization touches</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.389" end="01:14:11.719" style="s2">you end up with this weird kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.960" end="01:14:14.699" style="s2">domestication of women that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.719" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">twisted and mutated into these weird</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.699" end="01:14:19.889" style="s2">weak and soft little things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:22.940" style="s2">some I think it&#39;s it&#39;s just an absolute</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.889" end="01:14:27.659" style="s2">crime against nature against everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.940" end="01:14:29.550" style="s2">to do that to a being so yeah and now</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.659" end="01:14:31.469" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it to the men especially in</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.550" end="01:14:34.050" style="s2">the West actually in the more affluent</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.469" end="01:14:35.880" style="s2">sections of the West - this thing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.050" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">we talked about before this snowflake</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.880" end="01:14:40.650" style="s2">ism and super safety and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:43.320" style="s2">thing it&#39;s you know taking the self</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.650" end="01:14:44.639" style="s2">domestication one step further and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.320" end="01:14:47.730" style="s2">means that you are now uh turley</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.639" end="01:14:49.980" style="s2">dependent on civilization all right how</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.730" end="01:14:52.020" style="s2">many people do we know who just that</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.980" end="01:14:55.050" style="s2">would have no chance at all to survive</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.020" end="01:14:56.310" style="s2">if the support apparatus came down well</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.050" end="01:14:57.780" style="s2">I like the tees of when we get into</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.310" end="01:14:59.550" style="s2">talks you know I like to scare them a</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.780" end="01:15:01.110" style="s2">little bit about POC elliptic</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.550" end="01:15:03.300" style="s2">and I say dude you know it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.110" end="01:15:05.820" style="s2">happen to you if the apocalypse happens</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.300" end="01:15:11.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna end up as jerky smoked over</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.820" end="01:15:13.770" style="s2">a burning tire fire I mean this is what</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.820" end="01:15:16.380" style="s2">happens to a domesticate of being when</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.770" end="01:15:18.830" style="s2">they&#39;re thrown into a wild situation</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.380" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">we&#39;re into just the reality of nature</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.830" end="01:15:23.940" style="s2">that&#39;s when you get fight or flight so</p>

<p begin="01:16:56.969" end="01:17:00.239" style="s2">have the discipline to know he&#39;s there</p>

<p begin="01:17:08.130" end="01:17:11.059" style="s2">know and then and then we&#39;re walking a</p>

<p begin="01:17:17.189" end="01:17:21.989" style="s2">just straight up boom hits him on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.409" end="01:17:24.959" style="s2">nose with the spear and and it turns and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.989" end="01:17:27.449" style="s2">off it goes you know it&#39;s there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.959" end="01:17:29.419" style="s2">there&#39;s not fight or flight in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.449" end="01:17:31.650" style="s2">relation there with those predators</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.419" end="01:17:34.860" style="s2">there&#39;s none of those things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.650" end="01:17:36.749" style="s2">just a profound knowingness you know and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.860" end="01:17:39.209" style="s2">then he&#39;s trying to train me up to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.749" end="01:17:40.229" style="s2">the same thing it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like a I</p>

<p begin="01:17:40.229" end="01:17:44.429" style="s2">training montage it&#39;s like Iraqi or</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.119" end="01:17:47.760" style="s2">something but he&#39;s um so there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.429" end="01:17:50.519" style="s2">flock of these stingrays and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.760" end="01:17:52.679" style="s2">pushing them towards me and making them</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.519" end="01:17:55.499" style="s2">all run towards me swim really fast</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.679" end="01:17:57.399" style="s2">towards me and crash into my legs and he</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.499" end="01:17:59.050" style="s2">says if you panic and lift your</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.399" end="01:18:01.119" style="s2">they&#39;ll sting you let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.050" end="01:18:04.659" style="s2">stared so he is making all these</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.119" end="01:18:06.550" style="s2">stingrays crash into my legs to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.659" end="01:18:09.280" style="s2">train me up to have that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.550" end="01:18:11.409" style="s2">fearlessness you know to overcome that</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.280" end="01:18:13.300" style="s2">and have that relation come into</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.409" end="01:18:14.919" style="s2">relation with those things and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.300" end="01:18:16.809" style="s2">in relation with that and in relation</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.919" end="01:18:19.780" style="s2">with your place and you&#39;re part of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.809" end="01:18:21.039" style="s2">complex system and your mind not your</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.780" end="01:18:22.899" style="s2">brain and we&#39;ll have to get into that</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.039" end="01:18:25.030" style="s2">next time is extending out into that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.899" end="01:18:28.679" style="s2">system you&#39;re not going to be surprised</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.030" end="01:18:32.169" style="s2">by a tiger so it&#39;s it&#39;s flight-or-fight</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.679" end="01:18:34.899" style="s2">responses is a I mean I know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.169" end="01:18:38.199" style="s2">game theorists like to base a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.899" end="01:18:40.030" style="s2">their theory in a lot of you know these</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.199" end="01:18:42.550" style="s2">kind of projections backwards onto a</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.030" end="01:18:45.159" style="s2">Paleolithic past that they&#39;re imagining</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.550" end="01:18:46.989" style="s2">but they&#39;re kind of imagining what what</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.159" end="01:18:49.030" style="s2">it would be like for them now if they</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.989" end="01:18:50.709" style="s2">were dropped back there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.030" end="01:18:52.749" style="s2">imagining what it would be like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.709" end="01:18:54.939" style="s2">actually be part of a landscape to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.749" end="01:18:57.010" style="s2">part of a natural system and to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.939" end="01:18:59.949" style="s2">integral to that and what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.010" end="01:19:03.090" style="s2">thinking what kind of genius it would</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.949" end="01:19:06.039" style="s2">take to be able to hold all of that and</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.090" end="01:19:08.590" style="s2">for that to be the model of your</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.039" end="01:19:11.019" style="s2">thinking yeah it&#39;s a point about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.590" end="01:19:12.309" style="s2">genius I mean something that you allude</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.019" end="01:19:15.369" style="s2">to you don&#39;t give the numbers but you</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.309" end="01:19:17.979" style="s2">allude to it it is known in physical</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.369" end="01:19:20.110" style="s2">anthropology that our Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.979" end="01:19:22.510" style="s2">ancestors had bigger brains than we did</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.110" end="01:19:25.059" style="s2">by about 10% because they had to deal</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.510" end="01:19:27.189" style="s2">with all this stuff right frankly we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.059" end="01:19:29.139" style="s2">get a little stupid and we have in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.189" end="01:19:31.689" style="s2">same way that a cow is the stupid form</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.139" end="01:19:34.719" style="s2">of Buffalo you know a domesticated human</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.689" end="01:19:37.719" style="s2">is about 10 percent less brain capacity</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.719" end="01:19:39.909" style="s2">than cro-magnon man yeah as much as the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.719" end="01:19:41.349" style="s2">capacity it&#39;s the connections you got</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.909" end="01:19:42.729" style="s2">trillions of potential neural</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.349" end="01:19:45.399" style="s2">connections and we&#39;re only using about</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.729" end="01:19:48.429" style="s2">15% of them at the moment if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.399" end="01:19:50.649" style="s2">genius so you know um if you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.429" end="01:19:53.320" style="s2">how that brain would have evolved and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.649" end="01:19:54.999" style="s2">what kind of thinking we would have had</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.320" end="01:19:57.189" style="s2">to have been doing to even grow that</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.999" end="01:19:59.769" style="s2">brain in the first place then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.189" end="01:20:02.889" style="s2">getting an idea of what some Paleolithic</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.769" end="01:20:04.269" style="s2">and Neolithic lifestyles were like and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.889" end="01:20:05.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what you need to base your</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.269" end="01:20:07.539" style="s2">theories and your models are</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.559" end="01:20:09.849" style="s2">and I needed to apply that complexity</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.539" end="01:20:12.429" style="s2">that way because otherwise you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.849" end="01:20:14.829" style="s2">grounding it in something that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.429" end="01:20:18.339" style="s2">reality and it&#39;s he gonna have a flawed</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.829" end="01:20:21.010" style="s2">system coming out of that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.339" end="01:20:23.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot a lot to that and again it</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.010" end="01:20:24.579" style="s2">comes back to this domestication why</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.349" end="01:20:26.349" style="s2">well I will say though I have to I have</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.579" end="01:20:28.119" style="s2">to kick back on you which you said a</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.349" end="01:20:30.519" style="s2">couple times in the book oh we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.119" end="01:20:31.689" style="s2">using 10% or 15% of our brain that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.689" end="01:20:36.189" style="s2">no no of the neural connections of the</p>

<p begin="01:20:40.780" end="01:20:45.489" style="s2">the way the brain works is by pruning</p>

<p begin="01:21:40.389" end="01:21:45.550" style="s2">and I thought about where to put this in</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.399" end="01:21:48.219" style="s2">in my topic less cuz it is important to</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.550" end="01:21:50.199" style="s2">the rest of the story but I didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.219" end="01:21:52.419" style="s2">it was good to have up front until we</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.199" end="01:21:55.869" style="s2">actually did a little bit of it which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.419" end="01:21:59.260" style="s2">this concept in your culture of the yard</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.869" end="01:22:02.050" style="s2">a form of storytelling but not just a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.260" end="01:22:03.609" style="s2">storytelling in American English when</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.050" end="01:22:05.169" style="s2">you say you&#39;re telling a yard it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.609" end="01:22:07.419" style="s2">little old-fashioned first of all</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.169" end="01:22:08.829" style="s2">something my grandfather about is I will</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.419" end="01:22:11.559" style="s2">tell you about you know got the yarn</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.829" end="01:22:15.849" style="s2">here young feller and it usually means</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.559" end="01:22:18.849" style="s2">long humorous and not very serious it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.849" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">an archaic Americanism I suppose it came</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.849" end="01:22:21.610" style="s2">over for me</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:24.760" style="s2">somewhere along the line but you use it</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.610" end="01:22:26.980" style="s2">in a very different way could you you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.760" end="01:22:29.230" style="s2">know just tell us a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.980" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">art of yarning I guess is the way to ask</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.230" end="01:22:35.440" style="s2">the question yeah well look I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:38.680" style="s2">um it you know comes back to this idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:41.320" style="s2">of a distributed sort of governance</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.680" end="01:22:42.820" style="s2">distributed cognition all of this sort</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.320" end="01:22:47.980" style="s2">of stuff it&#39;s just a modality that</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.820" end="01:22:50.410" style="s2">arises from that so basically the truth</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.980" end="01:22:53.830" style="s2">and and the big picture that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.410" end="01:22:55.570" style="s2">form of the context that you&#39;re in so</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.830" end="01:22:58.000" style="s2">that you can make accurate predictions</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.570" end="01:22:59.380" style="s2">moving forward you know so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.000" end="01:23:01.900" style="s2">make plans that are actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.380" end="01:23:05.410" style="s2">work in the real world you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.900" end="01:23:08.790" style="s2">an aggregate of stories so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.410" end="01:23:11.410" style="s2">just have one story dominating you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.790" end="01:23:13.030" style="s2">you can&#39;t have one point of view you</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.410" end="01:23:15.790" style="s2">know winning the debate and coming out</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.030" end="01:23:17.860" style="s2">on top and then we have to build</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.790" end="01:23:20.470" style="s2">everything from that model you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.860" end="01:23:23.260" style="s2">every different story every person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.470" end="01:23:25.620" style="s2">story must be heard and the truth lies</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.260" end="01:23:27.940" style="s2">in that aggregate of all those stories</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.620" end="01:23:29.650" style="s2">you know I think I mean a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.940" end="01:23:31.930" style="s2">are doing that with through with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.650" end="01:23:34.150" style="s2">kinds of data that they&#39;re gathering you</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.930" end="01:23:35.620" style="s2">know in corporations now to help them</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.150" end="01:23:39.130" style="s2">out they&#39;re getting all those micro</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.620" end="01:23:41.560" style="s2">yarns I guess and putting them together</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.130" end="01:23:43.870" style="s2">and and analyzing them to come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.560" end="01:23:46.030" style="s2">bigger picture and the outliers in those</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.870" end="01:23:48.250" style="s2">in those yards are important to you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.030" end="01:23:50.290" style="s2">like the ones that don&#39;t sort of go</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.250" end="01:23:52.120" style="s2">along with the consensus you know that</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.290" end="01:23:55.710" style="s2">they actually come out of it as well so</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.120" end="01:23:58.060" style="s2">a yarn is kind of almost a ritualized</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.710" end="01:24:00.970" style="s2">you know conversation with a group of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.060" end="01:24:03.730" style="s2">people and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite dynamic and</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.970" end="01:24:05.500" style="s2">you know overlapping and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.730" end="01:24:08.140" style="s2">lots of story there&#39;s lots of acting</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.500" end="01:24:10.960" style="s2">things out drawing images in the air or</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.140" end="01:24:12.670" style="s2">on the ground you know basically with</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.960" end="01:24:15.520" style="s2">the goal of arriving at a loose</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.670" end="01:24:18.430" style="s2">consensus of what the reality is you</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.520" end="01:24:20.020" style="s2">know and yeah your decisions come out of</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.430" end="01:24:21.940" style="s2">that there&#39;s usually food that&#39;s eaten</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.020" end="01:24:25.270" style="s2">or a cup of tea or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.940" end="01:24:27.310" style="s2">or it&#39;s done around an activity of you</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.270" end="01:24:29.200" style="s2">know making something or or whatever but</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.310" end="01:24:32.940" style="s2">it happens like that is quite ritualized</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.200" end="01:24:35.580" style="s2">and good but you see a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.940" end="01:24:37.800" style="s2">things coming through people talk about</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.580" end="01:24:39.270" style="s2">talking circles and yawning circles and</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.800" end="01:24:41.250" style="s2">all these things and I&#39;m sure you have</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.270" end="01:24:43.020" style="s2">it in the states too you know where they</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.250" end="01:24:45.870" style="s2">sit in a circle and go round clockwise</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.020" end="01:24:48.600" style="s2">with a bloody Talking Stick or something</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.870" end="01:24:51.570" style="s2">you&#39;re not I mean so everybody because</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.600" end="01:24:53.310" style="s2">people are oh my god you know eat you</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.570" end="01:24:55.290" style="s2">know everybody has to have a voice but</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.310" end="01:24:57.810" style="s2">people have to be heard you know and</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.290" end="01:24:59.850" style="s2">that that that&#39;s one of the the most</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.810" end="01:25:02.130" style="s2">annoying whining things that annoys me</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.850" end="01:25:05.550" style="s2">about the hero we&#39;re living in is this</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.130" end="01:25:08.460" style="s2">idea of being heard I I don&#39;t feel heard</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.550" end="01:25:10.800" style="s2">and you know so everybody has to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.460" end="01:25:12.270" style="s2">their turn to speak even if what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.800" end="01:25:14.160" style="s2">saying is rubbish and they&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.270" end="01:25:17.040" style="s2">way too long probably like I&#39;m doing now</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.160" end="01:25:18.810" style="s2">and you get someone monologuing and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.040" end="01:25:20.670" style="s2">everyone has to sit politely and wait</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.810" end="01:25:23.340" style="s2">for them to finish and then they pass</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.670" end="01:25:25.920" style="s2">the stick to the next person and it goes</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.340" end="01:25:27.719" style="s2">clockwise too and and they kind of I</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.920" end="01:25:29.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know that they&#39;re kind of saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.719" end="01:25:32.460" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something indigenous or</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.400" end="01:25:35.910" style="s2">indigenized and that you know a circle</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.460" end="01:25:38.460" style="s2">is you know is is more democratic and</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.910" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">there&#39;s no hierarchies here and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.460" end="01:25:45.090" style="s2"> you basically turn a circle</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:47.580" style="s2">into a line hey you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.090" end="01:25:49.980" style="s2">queue that&#39;s going around us it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.580" end="01:25:52.350" style="s2">or a Boris that snake eating its tail I</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.980" end="01:25:54.000" style="s2">mean a real a real yarn is a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.350" end="01:25:55.830" style="s2">complex than that and actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.000" end="01:25:58.900" style="s2">give this rise to some very important</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.830" end="01:26:00.610" style="s2">outcomes and you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.900" end="01:26:02.980" style="s2">let me feedback to you something in my</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.610" end="01:26:05.230" style="s2">own experience that sounds fair amount</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.980" end="01:26:06.940" style="s2">like the way you describe a yarn you</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.230" end="01:26:08.710" style="s2">know one of the passions of my life</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.940" end="01:26:10.960" style="s2">since I was fifteen years old has been</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.710" end="01:26:13.030" style="s2">deer hunting one of the things I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.960" end="01:26:15.040" style="s2">with my best friends and to this day</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.030" end="01:26:18.040" style="s2">they&#39;re still my best friends goddamnit</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:21.220" style="s2">fifty years later right and in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.040" end="01:26:25.050" style="s2">evening after a day&#39;s hunt there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.220" end="01:26:27.850" style="s2">very strange complicated beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.050" end="01:26:30.460" style="s2">fulfilling conversation that happens</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.850" end="01:26:32.770" style="s2">amongst the hunters let&#39;s imagine in</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.460" end="01:26:35.230" style="s2">later day a typical number of us it will</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.770" end="01:26:36.910" style="s2">be cooking together eating together and</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.230" end="01:26:39.400" style="s2">drinking together let&#39;s not forget that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.910" end="01:26:42.460" style="s2">maybe nine or ten people in the fairly</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.400" end="01:26:45.100" style="s2">small little hunt camp and we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.460" end="01:26:46.990" style="s2">telling what we saw during the day we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.100" end="01:26:48.310" style="s2">be talking about where we saw deer where</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.990" end="01:26:51.010" style="s2">they were coming from where they were</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.310" end="01:26:53.200" style="s2">going to what they were eating what</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.010" end="01:26:55.150" style="s2">their behavior was like and then oh by</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.200" end="01:26:56.650" style="s2">the way we might also do a digression</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.150" end="01:26:59.020" style="s2">and to what we were daydreaming about</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.650" end="01:27:01.360" style="s2">right or what we&#39;re thinking about and</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.020" end="01:27:02.800" style="s2">then and to your point about it not</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.360" end="01:27:04.570" style="s2">being linear and everybody having their</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.800" end="01:27:07.090" style="s2">ten minutes of time I mean it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.570" end="01:27:08.920" style="s2">talking over each other but it&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.090" end="01:27:10.720" style="s2">interesting one is that some hunters are</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.920" end="01:27:13.990" style="s2">frankly better than other hunters right</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.720" end="01:27:15.520" style="s2">some hunters are super observant I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.990" end="01:27:18.130" style="s2">thinking in our little hunting circle</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.520" end="01:27:21.580" style="s2">and so X when X speaks people listen</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.130" end="01:27:23.800" style="s2">because X really knows deer</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.580" end="01:27:25.030" style="s2">right and if you want to get a deer</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.800" end="01:27:27.010" style="s2">especially a big one we&#39;re typically</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.030" end="01:27:29.440" style="s2">buck hunters trophy hunters this</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.010" end="01:27:31.360" style="s2">particular group you listen to an X as</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.440" end="01:27:34.750" style="s2">and you&#39;ll learn more than what Y has to</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.360" end="01:27:38.290" style="s2">say but Z now this Z is the most amazing</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.750" end="01:27:41.470" style="s2">one Z is a buffoon at one level in that</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.290" end="01:27:43.390" style="s2">he is not super observant of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.470" end="01:27:46.420" style="s2">going on around him he&#39;s not a great</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.390" end="01:27:48.010" style="s2">shot he&#39;s got bad eyes but he still gets</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.420" end="01:27:51.130" style="s2">his fair share of deer but what does Z&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.010" end="01:27:54.370" style="s2">super power Z is the repository of</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.130" end="01:27:58.030" style="s2">cultural memory Z remembers every detail</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.370" end="01:28:01.240" style="s2">of every deer kill of this group ever</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.030" end="01:28:03.430" style="s2">right typically as related by the hunter</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.240" end="01:28:06.880" style="s2">himself you know Z didn&#39;t observe all</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.430" end="01:28:09.880" style="s2">this stuff but Z listens with great</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.880" end="01:28:11.470" style="s2">precision and interest to the stories as</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.880" end="01:28:12.560" style="s2">they&#39;re told and he turns them into</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.470" end="01:28:14.090" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.560" end="01:28:16.820" style="s2">in the middle of one of these wild</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.090" end="01:28:19.100" style="s2">floating talking over each other meta</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.820" end="01:28:20.660" style="s2">conversations about deer hunting there</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.100" end="01:28:22.820" style="s2">may be a story that&#39;s sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.660" end="01:28:25.640" style="s2">similar a piece of data that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.820" end="01:28:28.910" style="s2">sufficiently similar to say hazy tell us</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.640" end="01:28:31.580" style="s2">the story about when H shot that</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.910" end="01:28:34.610" style="s2">10-point buck over on Big Buck Ridge</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.580" end="01:28:36.770" style="s2">right and then sure enough Z will tell</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.610" end="01:28:39.070" style="s2">the story in impeccable detail and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.770" end="01:28:42.260" style="s2">have it more or less right every time</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.070" end="01:28:43.880" style="s2">hmm we&#39;ll see so the wisdom of your</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.260" end="01:28:46.940" style="s2">group the knowledge of your group and</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.880" end="01:28:49.490" style="s2">the deer knowledge it doesn&#39;t sit with</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.940" end="01:28:52.880" style="s2">any individual it&#39;s held by the entire</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.490" end="01:28:54.410" style="s2">group and all the stories absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.880" end="01:28:56.120" style="s2">then there&#39;s an outcome to it you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.410" end="01:28:59.060" style="s2">we decide where each of us are going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.120" end="01:29:00.380" style="s2">hunt the next day that&#39;s it and you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.060" end="01:29:02.720" style="s2">again it makes a big difference because</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.380" end="01:29:04.760" style="s2">the the deer run differently each year</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.720" end="01:29:06.920" style="s2">depending on how the a corn crop is how</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.760" end="01:29:08.840" style="s2">much grass there is how much water how</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.920" end="01:29:11.420" style="s2">cold it is is there a full moon or not</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.840" end="01:29:12.800" style="s2">is there snow on the ground and so and</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.420" end="01:29:14.780" style="s2">further because we&#39;re trying to be safe</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.800" end="01:29:17.090" style="s2">we want everyone to know where everybody</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.780" end="01:29:19.460" style="s2">else is so this whole meta conversation</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.090" end="01:29:21.890" style="s2">actually has a result was at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.460" end="01:29:24.050" style="s2">the conversation each one of the nine or</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.890" end="01:29:26.210" style="s2">ten hunters has selected one of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.050" end="01:29:28.640" style="s2">named spots that&#39;s the other interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.210" end="01:29:30.140" style="s2">thing all these little spots were you</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.640" end="01:29:32.510" style="s2">hunt have names right</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.140" end="01:29:36.200" style="s2">you know there&#39;s big buck there&#39;s white</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.510" end="01:29:37.940" style="s2">oak flat there&#39;s morg hollow there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.200" end="01:29:39.770" style="s2">nob you know it&#39;s funny and then by the</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.940" end="01:29:42.380" style="s2">end of the night it might go on for four</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.770" end="01:29:45.080" style="s2">or five hours people will call out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.380" end="01:29:47.810" style="s2">going to the nob I&#39;m going to Nash field</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.080" end="01:29:50.840" style="s2">I&#39;m going here and it says your stories</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.810" end="01:29:52.910" style="s2">your stories on maps as well it&#39;s indeed</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.840" end="01:29:56.150" style="s2">and we all hunt at the same place every</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.910" end="01:29:59.300" style="s2">time so we have a deep deep knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.150" end="01:30:01.430" style="s2">place about this place where we hunt see</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.300" end="01:30:03.650" style="s2">I mean everything that I write about in</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.430" end="01:30:05.900" style="s2">the book you know it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.650" end="01:30:08.180" style="s2">biggest reactions I get is just how</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.900" end="01:30:11.000" style="s2">familiar people feel with with these</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.180" end="01:30:13.100" style="s2">things these indigenous ways that go ah</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.000" end="01:30:15.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve done that or I&#39;ve experienced that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.100" end="01:30:18.140" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically that&#39;s just it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.770" end="01:30:21.989" style="s2">factory settings indigenous is just is</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.140" end="01:30:24.690" style="s2">human baseline human who you are</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.989" end="01:30:26.820" style="s2">you know um you can be taken away from</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.690" end="01:30:29.070" style="s2">that and domesticated into some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.820" end="01:30:31.619" style="s2">shriveled ridiculous other kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.070" end="01:30:33.840" style="s2">person but that at your base is who you</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.619" end="01:30:36.539" style="s2">are that was who you were born ass every</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.840" end="01:30:40.409" style="s2">baby&#39;s born the same and it&#39;s born in</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.539" end="01:30:41.880" style="s2">that wild state and yeah and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.409" end="01:30:43.949" style="s2">until it gets sort of twisted and</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.880" end="01:30:45.570" style="s2">domesticated and ruined and broken that</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.949" end="01:30:48.659" style="s2">turns into something else this</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.570" end="01:30:50.550" style="s2">industrialized thing that we see before</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.659" end="01:30:53.099" style="s2">us now that feedlot people that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.550" end="01:30:54.900" style="s2">become people are familiar here and I</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.099" end="01:30:57.420" style="s2">keep telling people in the last message</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.900" end="01:30:59.999" style="s2">I&#39;d say this is doable mining the</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.420" end="01:31:02.219" style="s2">margins for indigenous wisdom you not</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.999" end="01:31:04.530" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be looking for some exotic</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.219" end="01:31:07.409" style="s2">other you know you&#39;ll find a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.530" end="01:31:09.059" style="s2">is right there with you if you really do</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.409" end="01:31:11.190" style="s2">look into yourself you you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.059" end="01:31:13.460" style="s2">fragments of that and each fragment</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.190" end="01:31:16.349" style="s2">contains the pattern of the whole and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.460" end="01:31:20.190" style="s2">the whole can be extrapolated out from</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.349" end="01:31:22.530" style="s2">from any fragment I believe so you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.190" end="01:31:24.869" style="s2">you you find your own way and your own</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.530" end="01:31:27.780" style="s2">stories and your own activities in your</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.869" end="01:31:31.349" style="s2">own place there it would be my advice to</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.780" end="01:31:33.239" style="s2">people I think that resonates true to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.349" end="01:31:35.820" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s one of the thing I</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.239" end="01:31:38.369" style="s2">took away from this book is that the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.820" end="01:31:40.170" style="s2">best parts of my life are the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.369" end="01:31:42.690" style="s2">are the most resonant with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.170" end="01:31:44.610" style="s2">indigenous perspective and well I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.690" end="01:31:46.920" style="s2">these great peak experience truthfully</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.610" end="01:31:49.349" style="s2">most of Western civilization life I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.920" end="01:31:51.030" style="s2">led has been a little on the gray side</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.349" end="01:31:53.429" style="s2">right and we&#39;re gonna build a new</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.030" end="01:31:55.829" style="s2">civilization why shouldn&#39;t we make it as</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.429" end="01:31:59.210" style="s2">wonderful as we can right incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.829" end="01:32:01.559" style="s2">more of these deep real human things</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.210" end="01:32:03.420" style="s2">well with that I&#39;m gonna I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.559" end="01:32:05.159" style="s2">gonna end it for today but as we talked</p>
