<p begin="00:00:03.669" end="00:00:08.050" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to deal with global crises</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.319" end="00:00:10.750" style="s2">is really understanding what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.050" end="00:00:13.660" style="s2">be human and a key piece of the answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.750" end="00:00:15.250" style="s2">to the question of what is humanity can</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.660" end="00:00:17.650" style="s2">be found in this really excellent book</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.250" end="00:00:22.180" style="s2">the social conquest of Earth by Edward o</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.650" end="00:00:25.180" style="s2">Wilson so yo Wilson is a biologist who</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.180" end="00:00:26.860" style="s2">studied ants and social animals in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.180" end="00:00:29.050" style="s2">general and how they form what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.860" end="00:00:31.810" style="s2">called super organisms where large</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.050" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">numbers of ants form a colony large</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.810" end="00:00:37.059" style="s2">numbers of bees form a hive and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:39.489" style="s2">that larger structure the hive or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.059" end="00:00:42.219" style="s2">colony operates as if it&#39;s an organism</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.489" end="00:00:44.829" style="s2">itself and so what he does in this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.219" end="00:00:48.339" style="s2">that&#39;s really wonderful is he explains</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.829" end="00:00:50.649" style="s2">how human social behavior came into</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.339" end="00:00:54.519" style="s2">being now there&#39;s a specific technical</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.649" end="00:00:57.879" style="s2">term called eusociality as spelled EU</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.519" end="00:01:00.489" style="s2">social you social is an organism that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.879" end="00:01:04.629" style="s2">able to create a social structure that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.489" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">includes members that are not</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.629" end="00:01:09.820" style="s2">necessarily identical twins and that can</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:12.430" style="s2">have multiple social roles or economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.820" end="00:01:15.130" style="s2">purposes and can incorporate more than</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.430" end="00:01:18.490" style="s2">one generation within that structure so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.130" end="00:01:21.820" style="s2">ants work this way bees wasps termites</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.490" end="00:01:26.140" style="s2">and that the only non insect example</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.820" end="00:01:28.840" style="s2">that has any real significance is humans</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.140" end="00:01:31.179" style="s2">so we humans are you social animals and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.840" end="00:01:33.219" style="s2">we think about it where the most social</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.179" end="00:01:35.500" style="s2">organism in the world because not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.219" end="00:01:38.140" style="s2">do we create complex structures</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.500" end="00:01:40.630" style="s2">societies in the ways that ants and bees</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.140" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">and termites do but we do it as mammals</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.630" end="00:01:45.429" style="s2">and one thing that&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:49.689" style="s2">remember about mammals is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.429" end="00:01:53.109" style="s2">live birth offspring and we have really</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.689" end="00:01:55.869" style="s2">strong parent-child emotional bonds set</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.109" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">differently humans have empathy and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.869" end="00:02:00.789" style="s2">form strong social relationships with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:02.859" style="s2">emotional ties and the other social</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.789" end="00:02:05.710" style="s2">animals meaning the other you social</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.859" end="00:02:07.960" style="s2">insects that have the same traits that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.710" end="00:02:10.630" style="s2">we do in terms of super organism do not</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.960" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">have this feature so what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.630" end="00:02:14.620" style="s2">makes humans so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">so interesting so important how does our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.620" end="00:02:19.000" style="s2">social behavior work and what does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:21.159" style="s2">tell us about how we should organize our</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:23.220" style="s2">societies moving forward well these</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.159" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">things are explored in an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.220" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">narrative in this book about how humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.849" style="s2">came to be the social animal that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:33.940" style="s2">and one of the things that I found very</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.849" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">powerful for me was this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.940" end="00:02:38.140" style="s2">multi-level selection which is in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">evolution we already know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.140" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">individual organisms meaning two males</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:47.470" style="s2">within a community will compete with</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">each other for food for sexual partners</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.470" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2">and so on but and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.319" style="s2">individual selection at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:54.910" style="s2">there&#39;s what&#39;s called group selection</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.319" end="00:02:56.980" style="s2">which is when there&#39;s one group</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.910" end="00:02:59.079" style="s2">competing with another group that one</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.980" end="00:03:02.349" style="s2">group may have advantageous properties</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.079" end="00:03:04.599" style="s2">in when over the other one for a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:06.250" style="s2">time and evolutionary theory there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.599" end="00:03:08.680" style="s2">big question whether it was group or</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.250" end="00:03:10.569" style="s2">individual and it turns out that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.680" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">both and the combination of more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.569" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">one level of selection is what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:16.930" style="s2">multi-level selection so it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.510" style="s2">that human beings have a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.930" end="00:03:22.180" style="s2">competitive hierarchy tendencies as</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.510" end="00:03:24.040" style="s2">individuals so we strive for status and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.180" end="00:03:26.109" style="s2">wealth we compare ourselves with their</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.040" end="00:03:27.430" style="s2">peers and try to do better and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.109" end="00:03:29.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of competition within our</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.430" end="00:03:32.410" style="s2">groups but at the same time we compete</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.799" end="00:03:35.319" style="s2">as groups and we naturally form groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.410" end="00:03:37.540" style="s2">so we like to form into tribes those</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.319" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">tribes can be based on sports and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.540" end="00:03:42.760" style="s2">type of fan that we are or religions or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:45.340" style="s2">national identities or hobbies that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.760" end="00:03:47.109" style="s2">have or many numbers many other things</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.340" end="00:03:51.400" style="s2">we&#39;re very very good at forming groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.109" end="00:03:53.069" style="s2">so this book explains all of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.400" end="00:03:56.019" style="s2">of our history all the ways that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.069" end="00:03:58.750" style="s2">social nature came into being which has</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.019" end="00:04:00.819" style="s2">profound in concrete insight into what</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.750" end="00:04:02.650" style="s2">it means to really be human with</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.819" end="00:04:05.319" style="s2">implications for how we should build our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.650" end="00:04:07.959" style="s2">societies so that they support our</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.319" end="00:04:09.430" style="s2">pro-social cooperative nature and help</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.959" end="00:04:12.489" style="s2">us to achieve things that are good for</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.430" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">us as a superorganism or in other words</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.489" end="00:04:17.229" style="s2">as a global civilization in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.400" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">century so if you want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.229" end="00:04:21.640" style="s2">more about human social nature or where</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:23.289" style="s2">it comes from how it works and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.640" end="00:04:24.420" style="s2">fascinating story of our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.289" end="00:04:25.920" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.420" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">then pick up this book the social</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:30.380" style="s2">conquest of birth and you will not be</p>
