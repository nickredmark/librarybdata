<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:37.830" style="s2">happening was I was having a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">conversation with the friend of mine who</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.830" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">said I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">and I as I was discussing with him what</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:46.650" style="s2">was going on it dawned on me that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:49.589" style="s2">frameworks that I had been developing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.650" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">for a long time that I some sass that</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:58.080" style="s2">obvious and so I expected maybe nine</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.580" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">hundred people might read this and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.080" end="00:01:03.269" style="s2">might be helpful to five or six and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">that&#39;d be cool and obviously it had more</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.269" end="00:01:11.909" style="s2">impact than that spread well pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">widely and so as it turns out it was of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">more value than I had anticipated</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">appears to be largely incapable of</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:39.510" style="s2">real time but much more interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">what happened afterwards which was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.510" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">sort of the self-healing and policing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:48.650" style="s2">mechanism of the larger social consensus</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">of how when have a blue church</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.650" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">reactively goes about maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:58.220" style="s2">integrity of its frame do you mean when</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">they tried to characterize it as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.220" end="00:02:03.480" style="s2">abusive trolls and you don&#39;t write hero</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">and all of that exactly exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.480" end="00:02:07.710" style="s2">sort of a to use of a military language</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">is a fallback position that was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.710" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">reactive almost instinctual and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">almost in fact precisely instinct she</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:14.940" style="s2">was that pure habit and so what ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">happening was there was a break in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.940" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">frame there was a glitch of the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">the mechanisms of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">reacted to endeavor to control the frame</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">and to convert it into a way of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:30.629" style="s2">making sense of the what occurred that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:30.920" style="s2">still maintained the integrity of its</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.920" end="00:02:36.980" style="s2">and that failed as well and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.819" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">clash between what happened when the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.980" end="00:02:45.500" style="s2">digital environment effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:48.530" style="s2">completely controlled the frame and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.500" end="00:02:51.980" style="s2">broadcast environment effectively tried</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.530" end="00:02:53.330" style="s2">and failed to do so I think is could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.980" end="00:02:55.610" style="s2">well characterized as running into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.330" end="00:02:58.010" style="s2">wall I was a journalist in the Channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.610" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">News newsroom for about 10 years that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.010" end="00:03:05.180" style="s2">fun and then working making</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">documentaries and I I guess I still got</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.180" end="00:03:09.170" style="s2">a lot of those similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:11.150" style="s2">connections and ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.170" end="00:03:13.400" style="s2">there seems to be in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.150" end="00:03:15.140" style="s2">media a sense that everything&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.400" end="00:03:17.330" style="s2">back to normal Trump might get impeached</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.140" end="00:03:20.450" style="s2">or things it still feels like an</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.330" end="00:03:22.670" style="s2">interregnum and that reality will will</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.450" end="00:03:26.360" style="s2">reassert itself in some way do you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:28.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s naive yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.360" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s naive in fact I would even say</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.160" end="00:03:34.190" style="s2">that is delusional my diagnosis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:36.519" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening is that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.190" end="00:03:40.340" style="s2">are moving further and further away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.519" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">what is what thinking actually is and or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.340" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">more into merely running a script a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.100" end="00:03:50.320" style="s2">legacy framework it used to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:55.390" style="s2">but now it&#39;s just a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.320" end="00:03:57.560" style="s2">input-output responses to stimuli hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.390" end="00:03:59.000" style="s2">this I think is what we thought happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.560" end="00:04:00.200" style="s2">in the interview with Jordan Peterson on</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.000" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">Channel 4 News that you called the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.200" end="00:04:05.600" style="s2">glitch in the matrix yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:08.209" style="s2">yes I get that could you explain what</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.600" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">you think was going on there then yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.209" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">think that if you imagine I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">some kind of more computational language</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:19.789" style="s2">but if you imagine a a very simple state</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:21.470" style="s2">machine that has pre predefined inputs</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.789" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">and predefined outputs of how it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.470" end="00:04:26.630" style="s2">responds to the world effectively that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:27.890" style="s2">what the journalist was running when she</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.630" end="00:04:31.130" style="s2">was running a very simple state machine</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.890" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2">it had a no capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.130" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">perceive reality directly insert it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">could only select from a finite number</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">of possible states of what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:44.569" style="s2">and so this is why we ended up with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:47.330" style="s2">bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.569" end="00:04:49.129" style="s2">where Petersen would say acts and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.330" end="00:04:51.740" style="s2">she would summarizes so you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.129" end="00:04:53.659" style="s2">something very much not X but this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.740" end="00:04:55.819" style="s2">because she had like a list of possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.659" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">things that could be said hold on like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.819" end="00:04:59.149" style="s2">it&#39;s just a finite list of possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.050" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">things and so if you if you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.149" end="00:05:02.089" style="s2">saying something was in that list to all</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:03.860" style="s2">that she could do is select something</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.089" end="00:05:07.490" style="s2">from that list for which she had already</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.860" end="00:05:10.159" style="s2">a prefab set of possible responses so as</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.490" end="00:05:12.649" style="s2">a program in a very computational sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.159" end="00:05:13.879" style="s2">and and this is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.649" end="00:05:16.219" style="s2">begin to become delusional when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.879" end="00:05:18.469" style="s2">begin to move away from a fluid</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.219" end="00:05:21.069" style="s2">intelligence that is in fact perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.469" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">reality and responding to reality in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.069" end="00:05:27.860" style="s2">fundamentally creative way into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.909" style="s2">functional intelligence which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.860" end="00:05:34.309" style="s2">selecting from a menu of prefab</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.909" end="00:05:39.469" style="s2">interpretative categories and executing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.309" end="00:05:43.069" style="s2">on a program of prefab responses and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.469" end="00:05:45.740" style="s2">should mention that this is not this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.069" end="00:05:47.689" style="s2">not rare this is actually commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:49.369" style="s2">this is a natural these are both natural</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.490" end="00:06:00.740" style="s2">it makes sense to have a fluid creative</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.319" end="00:06:16.879" style="s2">or exploration and sometimes it makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.409" style="s2">sense to just see something identified</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.340" end="00:07:04.130" style="s2">at making things up and pretending but</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.980" end="00:07:07.340" style="s2">eventually reality is reality the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.130" end="00:07:11.860" style="s2">culture were the the 20th century was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.340" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">decisive success for blue and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.860" end="00:07:19.880" style="s2">effectively a route for red so what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:25.040" style="s2">see first is that red was forced to move</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.880" end="00:07:27.979" style="s2">into a deeply exploratory phase second</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.040" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">that it did this in a context where as</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.979" end="00:07:32.419" style="s2">it turns out things were changing</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:34.070" style="s2">meaningfully quite significantly in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.419" end="00:07:36.040" style="s2">it from my perspective a in a world</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.070" end="00:07:39.950" style="s2">historical level the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.040" end="00:07:41.780" style="s2">entirely new forms of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.950" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">therefore entirely new forms of sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.780" end="00:07:46.460" style="s2">making and coherence it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:49.580" style="s2">necessarily the case of those two things</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.460" end="00:07:53.690" style="s2">would have overlapped but they did and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.580" end="00:07:57.860" style="s2">so in a context of a a blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.690" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">blue faith hegemony and I should mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.860" end="00:08:04.729" style="s2">by the way we&#39;re particular the blue</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">faith increasingly was it was utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.729" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">its coercive authority over most of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:16.970" style="s2">collective intelligence channels media</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:19.010" style="s2">and education in particular to establish</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.970" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">its dominance at the level of values and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">to extinguish red values putting an</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:31.010" style="s2">enormous amount of selective pressure on</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.169" end="00:08:34.570" style="s2">the the the groups that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.010" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">endeavoring to operate under red values</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.570" end="00:08:38.870" style="s2">and of course selective pressure either</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:40.430" style="s2">kills your it makes you very clever and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">so ended up happy news you&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.430" end="00:08:45.050" style="s2">of exploration of different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:46.490" style="s2">survive and thrive under was it what</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.050" end="00:08:47.779" style="s2">we&#39;re changing conditions and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.490" end="00:08:50.779" style="s2">that&#39;s I think the thing to be really</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.779" end="00:08:53.630" style="s2">focusing on you&#39;re imagining as I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.779" end="00:08:56.450" style="s2">that we are witnessing a transition</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.630" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;re witnessing a shift which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.450" end="00:09:02.029" style="s2">largely characterized by on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:06.709" style="s2">legacy which has lots of power and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:09.020" style="s2">inertia and energy behind it and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.709" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">emergent which has the advantages of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.020" end="00:09:18.019" style="s2">being closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:19.339" style="s2">shift in reality it&#39;s a ship a ship that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.019" end="00:09:22.339" style="s2">has a lot of inertia that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.339" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">process of trying to turn so the state</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.339" end="00:09:28.459" style="s2">is blue church but the rate is red</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:31.009" style="s2">insurgency or more specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.459" end="00:09:32.779" style="s2">actual underlying shipped in broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.009" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">in digital so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.779" end="00:09:35.959" style="s2">we&#39;re witnessing or one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:37.339" style="s2">that we can use this event to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.959" end="00:09:39.259" style="s2">that is saying okay where are we on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.339" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">trajectory what is the rate of change</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.259" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">and how are the relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:49.639" style="s2">the inertia inertia power a coercive</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">capacity of blue visa V the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.639" end="00:09:53.990" style="s2">capacity of red you can almost like</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:57.589" style="s2">imagine two lines in a graph okay where</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.990" end="00:10:01.490" style="s2">are we on that crossover so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.589" end="00:10:02.629" style="s2">say is this represents we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.490" end="00:10:05.449" style="s2">closer and closer to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.629" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">crossover and that implies significant</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.449" end="00:10:10.939" style="s2">things across a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:12.170" style="s2">domains and we can then use that to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.939" end="00:10:13.459" style="s2">predictions about what&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.170" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">happen in the future under different</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">say for example I apologize any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.550" end="00:10:23.959" style="s2">event that emerges where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:25.399" style="s2">social need to make sense of what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.959" end="00:10:27.319" style="s2">event means for the purposes of then</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.399" end="00:10:33.170" style="s2">choosing how we&#39;re going to respond we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.319" end="00:10:35.629" style="s2">can now predict that the capacity of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.180" end="00:10:44.509" style="s2">some threshold and that the emergent</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.410" end="00:10:57.709" style="s2">openness is creative experimentation the</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.819" end="00:11:21.800" style="s2">complex that shows up as blue hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.089" end="00:11:23.300" style="s2">at a physiological level which is why</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.800" end="00:11:25.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of an interesting paradox</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.300" end="00:11:27.230" style="s2">that blue</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.010" end="00:11:28.550" style="s2">I kind of got stuck in an ideology</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.230" end="00:11:31.310" style="s2">around openness rather than openness</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.550" end="00:11:32.540" style="s2">itself which also is probably the</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.790" end="00:13:08.390" style="s2">from their ideology and then in gather</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:10.190" style="s2">and engage in a an authentic exploration</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:31.540" style="s2">shows up is either duty or loyalty but</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.410" end="00:14:35.709" style="s2">those are both ideologies the the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.540" end="00:14:37.000" style="s2">sense is that ability responsibility</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.940" end="00:14:56.350" style="s2">as politically ideological certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.290" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">there are people who are currently part</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.350" end="00:15:01.060" style="s2">of blue who feel that deeply what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">saying is that that shows up much much</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.060" end="00:15:05.800" style="s2">more intensely in red and when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.790" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">peterson or do you think the fact the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.040" end="00:15:21.940" style="s2">issue is that he is is not definable</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:23.260" style="s2">within one of those two camps yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.940" end="00:15:25.449" style="s2">think that&#39;s the point I think that he</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.260" end="00:15:27.339" style="s2">grasps directly the fact that human</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.449" end="00:15:30.699" style="s2">beings can only actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.339" end="00:15:32.980" style="s2">the world by virtue of communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.699" end="00:15:35.380" style="s2">with other human beings and this is all</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.380" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">must have a mixture of of whoa I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.709" end="00:15:44.470" style="s2">uses the mythopoetic to make sense the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:48.069" style="s2">order order and chaos the way right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.470" end="00:15:50.769" style="s2">taoist way is the alchemical admixture</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.069" end="00:15:53.620" style="s2">of order and chaos and that&#39;s it like</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.769" end="00:15:56.829" style="s2">that&#39;s how you do it and so if you bias</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.620" end="00:16:01.779" style="s2">towards orderliness you find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.829" end="00:16:04.870" style="s2">a rigid non adaptive non creative non</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.779" end="00:16:07.480" style="s2">exploratory framework which will die</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.870" end="00:16:11.019" style="s2">because the world changes if you bias</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.480" end="00:16:14.019" style="s2">towards chaos you you eat your young and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.019" end="00:16:14.829" style="s2">evaporate which also ties for obvious</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.019" end="00:16:16.449" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.829" end="00:16:17.889" style="s2">and the key is to actually enable these</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.449" end="00:16:19.420" style="s2">things to be in relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.889" end="00:16:21.160" style="s2">other and vital healthy relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.420" end="00:16:22.510" style="s2">with each other and I think that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.160" end="00:16:23.640" style="s2">some sense the essence of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.510" end="00:16:25.589" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.640" end="00:16:29.730" style="s2">and instead of the core what he&#39;s acting</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.589" end="00:16:36.329" style="s2">about now it it does it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.730" end="00:16:37.800" style="s2">on the one hand he connects war hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.329" end="00:16:40.410" style="s2">it does it seems to me that he connects</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.800" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">more closely with a lot of the values</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.410" end="00:16:47.610" style="s2">that would come out of read out of order</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">lines at a personal level I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.610" end="00:16:51.899" style="s2">know that when I interact with his stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:55.050" style="s2">when I perceive his videos I read his</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.899" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">works the aspect of me that has that in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.050" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">it seems to be the part that is called</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.850" end="00:17:03.570" style="s2">out and connected like I can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">aesthetic of say Sparta which is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.570" end="00:17:12.750" style="s2">sort of read as a as a metaphor moreso</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">than Athens but not radically so and as</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.750" end="00:17:15.299" style="s2">a consequence I think this is also one</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">of the reasons why his audience has</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.299" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">begun to self-select for individuals for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:26.010" style="s2">whom that is a yearning and a calling mm</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:27.540" style="s2">but that&#39;s not and and also I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.010" end="00:17:33.559" style="s2">because he&#39;s in an environment he</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.540" end="00:17:36.450" style="s2">perceives the chaos aspect has run amok</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.559" end="00:17:38.669" style="s2">and has locked out a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.450" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">orderliness stuff he&#39;s also presenting</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.669" end="00:17:42.840" style="s2">an antidote he&#39;s presenting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:43.799" style="s2">more in the direction of orderliness and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.840" end="00:17:46.470" style="s2">more in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.799" end="00:17:48.360" style="s2">responsibilities because we&#39;re way off</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.360" end="00:17:52.710" style="s2">the way we&#39;re going to have to pick up a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.980" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">lot more of that to get us back in but</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.710" end="00:17:57.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s that&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:00.299" style="s2">more needful now you said children of</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.299" end="00:18:04.620" style="s2">intelligence as to fight back against</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.190" end="00:18:11.010" style="s2">yeah in fact this is a good opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.080" end="00:18:13.710" style="s2">maybe to double click on it so the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.010" end="00:18:18.390" style="s2">thing is to is focusing on this fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.710" end="00:18:20.669" style="s2">that it is precisely because a set of</p>
