<p begin="00:03:18.230" end="00:03:26.240" style="s2">and mystery and intelligence in of which</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.620" end="00:03:30.050" style="s2">we are an expression we were we are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.240" end="00:03:31.790" style="s2">cosmos in human form and it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.050" end="00:03:36.230" style="s2">happens in the state of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">rebirth that we reconnect to the sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.230" end="00:03:42.920" style="s2">that that we are we are cosmic beings</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:44.450" style="s2">and we&#39;re also participating in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.920" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">something much bigger than us so we</p>

<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:51.830" style="s2">experience but also exalted by</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.830" end="00:03:58.910" style="s2">infused through us so I think we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.600" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">very dicey place right now where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.910" end="00:04:05.540" style="s2">question is will enough people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:07.730" style="s2">individuals go through this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.540" end="00:04:12.530" style="s2">profound inner transformation an inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.730" end="00:04:15.800" style="s2">work inner journey to be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.530" end="00:04:17.810" style="s2">through what is basically a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.800" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">symbolic spiritual death so that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.810" end="00:04:24.830" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do it literally and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">already set in motion destructive forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.830" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">and some of those forces are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.900" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">are you know already affecting the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:39.660" style="s2">and probably are going to continue and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:42.600" style="s2">the question is will the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.660" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">near-death experience that we are kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.600" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">of going through in sort of slow motion</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">right now be sufficient to catalyze</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">enough of a psycho spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:05:01.639" style="s2">transformation in enough people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:05:06.120" style="s2">those people can serve as centers of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.639" end="00:05:09.479" style="s2">insight and equilibrium so to inform the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.120" end="00:05:11.340" style="s2">whole in a way it it doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.479" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">everybody to do this but it takes enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:19.110" style="s2">people who are able to their sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:23.070" style="s2">and their transformation can ripple out</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.110" end="00:05:26.419" style="s2">you know through through the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:30.120" style="s2">work that you you you do with your</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.419" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">organization and with the with the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.120" end="00:05:36.630" style="s2">of access that we have through podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:39.479" style="s2">and and things that aren&#39;t being put on</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.630" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">the mainstream channels of television or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.479" end="00:05:45.510" style="s2">even taught in the universities I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:47.690" style="s2">that can ripple out enough where if</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.510" end="00:05:51.599" style="s2">enough individuals are carrying that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.690" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">transformation it can actually help</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.599" end="00:05:59.669" style="s2">catalyze a larger transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">collective because it&#39;s at just such</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.669" end="00:06:08.159" style="s2">moments of instability that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">chaotic disequilibrium can suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.159" end="00:06:12.419" style="s2">reconfigure in a new way in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:16.770" style="s2">are not possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.419" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">when it&#39;s not so volatile so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.770" end="00:06:23.400" style="s2">that&#39;s my fervent hope and maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:27.590" style="s2">just end this with the idea that hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.400" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">itself can play a role I think to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.590" end="00:06:33.659" style="s2">hope and faith in the darkness is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:36.599" style="s2">important and in some sense it&#39;s only in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.659" end="00:06:39.300" style="s2">dark periods that that you develop faith</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.599" end="00:06:41.760" style="s2">and hope with everything&#39;s just light</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.300" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">and glorious and hunky-dory</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.760" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t develop those muscles you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:50.190" style="s2">something that happens on in challenging</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:53.310" style="s2">times and that develops the the moral</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:56.340" style="s2">spiritual fiber that we need and hope is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.310" end="00:06:59.460" style="s2">one of those virtues of that I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.340" end="00:07:02.010" style="s2">cultivating that it will be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.460" end="00:07:07.350" style="s2">important I read passion of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.010" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">mind at university back in 93 94 and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.350" end="00:07:11.700" style="s2">say it probably had the most impact of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">anything I&#39;ve ever read as a kind of map</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.700" end="00:07:17.070" style="s2">of the history of Western thinking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:17.850" style="s2">the kind of the bind that we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.850" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">in terms of Western philosophy and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.950" end="00:07:27.450" style="s2">how we might get out of it and for me a</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:29.040" style="s2">lot of what you wrote about then still</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.450" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">feels very very current it still seemed</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.040" end="00:07:31.890" style="s2">like a very accurate description of</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.920" end="00:07:38.850" style="s2">fairly big audience at the moment a lot</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.260" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">me about Jordan Peterson and the IDW</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.250" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">what are the ideas that have been sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.590" end="00:08:19.380" style="s2">of maybe on the fringes of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">you could say Young is kind of on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.380" end="00:08:22.230" style="s2">fringes of our culture and we&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:24.810" style="s2">been sort of out there in the New Age</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.230" end="00:08:27.720" style="s2">and hugely influential thinker but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.810" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">certainly not part of the mainstream and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.720" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">I&#39;d argue that you are one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:35.370" style="s2">thinkers as well hugely influential in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:37.470" style="s2">many different areas but but never kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.370" end="00:08:39.570" style="s2">of part of the mainstream I&#39;d love if</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.470" end="00:08:41.340" style="s2">you could just introduce yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.570" end="00:08:44.220" style="s2">tell me a little bit about your your</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:47.990" style="s2">background life story and in two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.220" end="00:08:50.730" style="s2">I was born in Geneva Switzerland of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.990" end="00:08:53.940" style="s2">American parents that grew up in in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.730" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">United States and I was educated</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.940" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">up through high school by by Jesuits and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:07.080" style="s2">and nuns before that and kind of got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:09.840" style="s2">pretty solid grounding in in you know at</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.080" end="00:09:12.620" style="s2">Greek and Latin and the classics and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.840" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">that it kind of imbued in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.620" end="00:09:19.380" style="s2">appreciation for for the the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:22.380" style="s2">intellectual spiritual legacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.380" end="00:09:25.350" style="s2">West and so I was kind of putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.380" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">together all these different you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.350" end="00:09:32.400" style="s2">attempting to integrate these different</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">influences and then I heard about Esalen</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.400" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">Institute in California when I was there</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">which in California I when I was still</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:47.730" style="s2">at Harvard is where I first heard about</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:51.390" style="s2">it and it sounded like a place where in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.730" end="00:09:54.780" style="s2">a sense then the new a new horizon was</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.390" end="00:09:57.420" style="s2">opening up of thinkers teachers</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.780" end="00:10:00.840" style="s2">practical also putting into practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">what these new ideas were that were</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.840" end="00:10:07.910" style="s2">being drawn from many different sources</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:11.460" style="s2">from shamanic traditions from ancient</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.910" end="00:10:12.570" style="s2">mystical Asian traditions from Western</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:15.930" style="s2">esotericism</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.570" end="00:10:19.140" style="s2">as well as contemporary psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.930" end="00:10:20.490" style="s2">practices their therapeutic so yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.140" end="00:10:22.200" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know what s elinoz s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.490" end="00:10:24.540" style="s2">alone is now pretty much universally</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.200" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">recognized as the sort of the granddaddy</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.540" end="00:10:27.930" style="s2">of the human potential movement right</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.880" style="s2">and Mother Church of the human potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.930" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">movement it was called in those years</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.880" end="00:10:34.080" style="s2">yeah you can say you&#39;ve got a Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:37.320" style="s2">behind you so we&#39;re in a were in a kind</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.320" end="00:10:41.610" style="s2">of seen as the a place where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.510" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">Eastern traditions came in but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.610" end="00:10:47.310" style="s2">really fascinating about your work is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:48.990" style="s2">that you have a huge respect for an</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.310" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">understanding of the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.990" end="00:10:52.290" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:57.150" style="s2">I drank deeply from the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.290" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">east and at a certain point it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.150" end="00:11:04.650" style="s2">night in my 20s I realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.260" end="00:11:07.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an East versus West thing and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.650" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">fact there was a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.610" end="00:11:18.519" style="s2">wisdom and depth in the West that I I I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">was informed by and I felt that in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.519" end="00:11:26.860" style="s2">generations desire to kind of wipe the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:33.050" style="s2">slate clean overthrow the the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.860" end="00:11:36.019" style="s2">oppressive ideas and structures of my of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.050" end="00:11:38.120" style="s2">our parents and previous generations</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.019" end="00:11:42.440" style="s2">that we were cutting ourselves off from</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.120" end="00:11:46.459" style="s2">from our own historical legacy from our</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.440" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">from our ancestry and and that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.459" end="00:11:51.589" style="s2">would be a kind of mutilation and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:55.459" style="s2">what we needed to do was to retrieve</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.589" end="00:11:59.959" style="s2">what was profound in that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.459" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">while also keeping a clear eye for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.959" end="00:12:06.100" style="s2">shadow of that tradition which we tended</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">to be unconscious of in the promotion of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.100" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">whether it was progress or monotheistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.770" end="00:12:19.940" style="s2">judeo-christian religious thought and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">I was always trying to kind of keep hold</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.940" end="00:12:24.670" style="s2">that that tension of opposites as Jung</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:31.550" style="s2">would say the importance of holding</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.670" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">multiple values that can be in tension</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.550" end="00:12:37.510" style="s2">with each other and if you can not</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:40.700" style="s2">prematurely fall into one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.510" end="00:12:42.640" style="s2">and and then demonize the other or some</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:47.240" style="s2">on negate it but if you can hold</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.640" end="00:12:50.500" style="s2">faithfully that tension then there seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.240" end="00:12:53.779" style="s2">to be something in the natural unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:56.660" style="s2">of the human psyche and of life that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.779" end="00:13:00.110" style="s2">moves towards a creative synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.660" end="00:13:04.310" style="s2">what is being kind of loyally held as as</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.110" end="00:13:07.910" style="s2">as opposites in tension and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.310" end="00:13:10.910" style="s2">pretty much what I did and what I sought</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.910" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">to do and and so passion Western 9 was</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.910" end="00:13:16.850" style="s2">one example of that even to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:20.029" style="s2">also seeking to do that with ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.850" end="00:13:25.129" style="s2">the masculine and the feminine as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.029" end="00:13:28.660" style="s2">mmm-hmm to to recognize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.129" end="00:13:34.910" style="s2">something deep going on in in our time</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.660" end="00:13:37.910" style="s2">that needs needs addressing involving</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.910" end="00:13:40.339" style="s2">the involving gender but also involving</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.910" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">the archetypal dimension behind gender</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.339" end="00:13:43.850" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:46.699" style="s2">you mentioned synthesis there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.850" end="00:13:48.649" style="s2">really what excites me about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.699" end="00:13:51.949" style="s2">potential of this moment for for</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.649" end="00:13:53.509" style="s2">intellectual synthesis you you start the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.949" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">epilogue to passion of the west of mine</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.509" end="00:13:57.740" style="s2">with a quote from Robert Bellah which i</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:13:59.509" style="s2">think is a really profound quote and</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:06.410" style="s2">like we may be seeing the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.069" end="00:14:08.209" style="s2">reintegration of consciousness that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.410" end="00:14:10.490" style="s2">be not on the basis of any single</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.339" end="00:14:28.670" style="s2">and and the idea of not ever falling</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.500" end="00:15:15.699" style="s2">Bela really carried that he wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.290" end="00:15:21.439" style="s2">in 1969 and and it is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.699" end="00:15:25.970" style="s2">rendering of our need to hold a a</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:49.810" style="s2">projections towards the world but what</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:51.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve all turned on has created the</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.200" end="00:22:09.170" style="s2">paradox because I think we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.130" end="00:22:11.620" style="s2">the the modern mind from</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.170" end="00:22:18.620" style="s2">you know Descartes and bacon and Locke</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.620" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">onward were very much focused on moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.620" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">out of an anthropocentric point of view</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">and you can actually see obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">Copernican revolution is seen as being</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:36.040" style="s2">like the the ERM moment the the primal</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.700" end="00:22:41.090" style="s2">cosmology in which the earth is the</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.090" end="00:22:46.850" style="s2">the human being is as the center of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.250" end="00:22:51.080" style="s2">cosmic design as it were and and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.850" end="00:22:54.500" style="s2">suddenly we&#39;re a spinning moving planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.080" end="00:23:00.350" style="s2">one amongst many and then there turns</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.500" end="00:23:02.390" style="s2">out there&#39;s billions of Suns in a galaxy</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:05.810" style="s2">that itself is one of billions of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.390" end="00:23:12.560" style="s2">galaxies so you have just this sequence</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.810" end="00:23:15.680" style="s2">of breaking out of the anthropocentric</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.560" end="00:23:18.050" style="s2">perspective this is kind of how the</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.050" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">until we become seen as being radically</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.050" end="00:23:28.810" style="s2">peripheral and part of that movement</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:31.220" style="s2">towards cleansing our perception of</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.890" end="00:41:35.519" style="s2">like Mary Ann Woodman who just passed</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.920" end="00:42:38.040" style="s2">while women certainly have of a kind of</p>
