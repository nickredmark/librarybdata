<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:54.150" style="s2">this is America</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">I like this section a lot and again</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.150" end="00:13:58.470" style="s2">found its inclusion quite surprising</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">there&#39;s even a bit of nostalgia for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.470" end="00:14:01.410" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.650" style="s2">something never seen on the progressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.410" end="00:14:07.080" style="s2">landscape there&#39;s emphasis on generosity</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.650" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">certainly but also real consideration</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.080" end="00:14:11.340" style="s2">given to aspirations big dreams</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">something that has been woefully lacking</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.340" end="00:14:16.140" style="s2">in the discourse generated by the left</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:18.450" style="s2">this is reiterated in the statement and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.140" end="00:14:20.610" style="s2">the freedom for anyone who wants to work</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.450" end="00:14:23.430" style="s2">hard to make those dreams come true</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.610" end="00:14:25.310" style="s2">which is again remarkable for its</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.430" end="00:14:26.810" style="s2">unabashed insistence</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.310" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between hard work</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.810" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">and success and that success in itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:35.210" style="s2">is desirable admirable and worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:37.370" style="s2">pursuing then there&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.210" end="00:14:39.860" style="s2">disavowal in my opinion of identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.370" end="00:14:42.490" style="s2">politics with each speaker alone and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.860" end="00:14:45.710" style="s2">identified visually as an individual an</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.490" end="00:14:47.960" style="s2">insistence on Fairplay an analogue of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.710" end="00:14:50.690" style="s2">equality of opportunity not outcome and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.960" end="00:14:53.690" style="s2">this direct statement from a policeman</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.690" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">no less and I hope that your business is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.690" end="00:14:57.950" style="s2">successful very radical in the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.140" style="s2">where success is all too often</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.950" end="00:15:00.740" style="s2">reflexively equated with privilege and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.140" end="00:15:03.380" style="s2">oppression</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.740" end="00:15:05.089" style="s2">I think the ethos in this section stands</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.380" end="00:15:06.950" style="s2">in powerful contradiction to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.089" end="00:15:09.890" style="s2">presented earlier where wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.950" end="00:15:12.710" style="s2">success was negatively portrayed which</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.890" end="00:15:15.140" style="s2">attitude is going to prevail it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.710" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">obvious to me that the latter message is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.140" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2">most desirable and also most likely to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:22.970" style="s2">generate a favorable majority response</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">people vote their dreams not the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.970" end="00:15:26.839" style="s2">realities and it is perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">for the Democrats to reconstitute</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.839" end="00:15:31.370" style="s2">themselves as the party that can make</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:34.010" style="s2">the dreams of individuals come true even</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.370" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">if those individuals occupy a lower rung</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.010" end="00:15:39.350" style="s2">on the economic ladder and to do so by</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:43.070" style="s2">insisting upon a fair playing field the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:45.950" style="s2">same rules and to note finally that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:48.080" style="s2">characterizes America this borders on</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.950" end="00:15:50.120" style="s2">stating that a shared value structure is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.080" end="00:15:52.010" style="s2">a necessary precondition for social</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.120" end="00:15:55.100" style="s2">harmony and for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.010" end="00:15:56.810" style="s2">progress and upward mobility much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.100" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">of this on the part of the Democrats is</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.810" end="00:16:02.690" style="s2">necessary and would be widely applauded</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:05.660" style="s2">and welcomed and this is our generations</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.690" end="00:16:08.120" style="s2">great calling to rise to the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.660" end="00:16:11.150" style="s2">like those who had the courage before us</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:13.089" style="s2">to build a future for all Americans not</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.150" end="00:16:15.730" style="s2">just the few</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.089" end="00:16:18.430" style="s2">to fight for the higher pay working</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.730" end="00:16:20.230" style="s2">people have more than earned to fight to</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.230" end="00:16:24.610" style="s2">who needs it to stop those who would try</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.660" end="00:16:27.249" style="s2">to cut the Social Security and Medicare</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.610" end="00:16:29.050" style="s2">benefits that are rightfully yours to</p>

<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:17:07.929" style="s2">free the film ends positively with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.559" end="00:17:10.750" style="s2">call to the future to build something</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.929" end="00:17:13.029" style="s2">promising it smart once again in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.750" end="00:17:14.620" style="s2">opinion by the reference to those who</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.029" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">had cut benefits and sell the</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:35.770" style="s2">been better for the reasons I outlined</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.330" end="00:17:38.740" style="s2">but it could have been a lot worse</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.770" end="00:17:41.080" style="s2">there&#39;s much less of the radical leftist</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.080" end="00:17:45.340" style="s2">characterized so much as the recent</p>
