<p begin="00:00:10.429" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">hey folks welcome back to the QA section</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.770" style="s2">of the Dark Horse podcast livestream we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">are now going to address your questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.770" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">and by we I mean I okay so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">start with the questions that came in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">the initial stream first one is how does</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">evolution account for racism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">Prejudice now this is a interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">because in my opinion it accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">them very easily and also tells us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">about what we have to do in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">past them but I&#39;ve had an ongoing battle</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">with some of my colleagues including</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">most prominently Richard Dawkins who</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:57.539" style="s2">does not believe it is productive to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">look at issues like lineage versus</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.539" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">lineage competition through an</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">evolutionary lens that is to say it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:07.100" style="s2">remains for me to compel my evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">colleagues that lineage against lineage</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">competition is a meaningful level at</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">which to analyze evolution so I am</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">excited for that challenge I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">deeply about this and I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">compelled that there&#39;s a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:22.280" style="s2">value to be had in thinking of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">in those terms and that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.280" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">metaphorical it is quite literally</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">something that selection sees in quotes</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">and acts upon lineages are real and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">line up quite well with things we tend</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">to see as races so anyway there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.930" style="s2">more to be said on that but yes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">an excellent question second question</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.930" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">what&#39;s worse media outlets financially</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">incentivize to keep us angry and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">paranoid or happy and complacent um</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough one I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about two different</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">failure modes and the truth is I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">would fear angry and paranoid more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">happy and complacent it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">wake from happy and complacent and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">recognize that something needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">done in fact in some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">that&#39;s the matrix so I guess I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">prefer the latter but I could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">compelled that actually that state is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">more dangerous and you know maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">the Huxley version okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:32.490" style="s2">third question voting rights were about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">representative democracy Minnesota and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.490" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">Minneapolis are a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:38.540" style="s2">progressive is this not proof that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">Democrats actually don&#39;t have blacks</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">support beyond mere lip service well</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">again I would go back to this principle</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:50.550" style="s2">that I&#39;m quite a strong believer in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2">which is that you can&#39;t hold people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.550" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">responsible for making bad choices when</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">they only have bad choices to choose</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:03:00.060" style="s2">amongst so my point would be when that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">is the case we all end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.060" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">something that we said we say to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">ourselves make sense but to others may</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">look incoherent and if it was not clear</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:14.910" style="s2">when I initially presented this my point</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">is that many of my friends on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.910" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">cannot fathom how anybody ends up voting</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:22.980" style="s2">for a guy like Donald Trump to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not so hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.980" end="00:03:27.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not a rational choice I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:30.540" style="s2">it and I wouldn&#39;t have voted for him but</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.240" end="00:03:32.580" style="s2">I can certainly understand a mentality</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.540" end="00:03:34.770" style="s2">that is just simply fed up with the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.580" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">old corruption and eager for something</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.770" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">new and so in any case it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:41.880" style="s2">choice that I think looks very different</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:45.800" style="s2">in light of the fact that no good</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.880" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">choices are provided as alternatives so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.800" end="00:03:49.710" style="s2">what that means in response to your</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.740" style="s2">question is that I see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.710" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">acting incoherently and when I see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.740" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">rather than judge them for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">incoherence of their action I have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">ask myself did they have clearly better</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">choices and often the answer is no okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">ah interesting a pallet of bricks was</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.510" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">placed in the path of Dallas rioters</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:13.770" style="s2">last night next to the courthouse where</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t any construction you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.770" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">find the video on Reddit and Twitter I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:21.450" style="s2">saw this video I decided not to show it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">because I cannot be sure of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.450" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">but it certainly was striking and there</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:29.550" style="s2">is a long history of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:31.289" style="s2">agent provocateurs taking a protest and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.550" end="00:04:33.990" style="s2">making it look like something that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.289" end="00:04:37.139" style="s2">isn&#39;t we saw this in the WTO protests</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.990" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">and elsewhere so if in fact that video</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.139" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">is what it appears to be it does look</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">like a stack of construction materials</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:47.789" style="s2">placed near a building with large</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">vulnerable windows with no other reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.789" end="00:04:52.710" style="s2">to be there but what I would have wanted</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:55.289" style="s2">was somebody to tour me around and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.710" end="00:04:57.570" style="s2">see what else might explain that stack</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.289" end="00:04:58.979" style="s2">of materials I would like to know from</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.570" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">witnesses whether that stack of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.979" end="00:05:02.190" style="s2">materials really did show up in advance</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">of the protests or if it had been there</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.190" end="00:05:06.150" style="s2">for a while basically I would like</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:08.250" style="s2">somebody to do due diligence on that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:10.259" style="s2">clip and figure out whether somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">attempting to create violence to seed</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.259" end="00:05:16.289" style="s2">violence by putting materials that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">cause people to innovate that strategy</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.289" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">or whether there was some innocent</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">explanation and that just the place</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">where it appeared something was up and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:29.669" style="s2">so people commented upon it anyway if</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:31.139" style="s2">people do know if there is someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.669" end="00:05:32.849" style="s2">done due diligence somebody on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.139" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">ground in that location I&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.849" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">interested to know about it but thanks</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">for the question okay could research</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">stations offer sanctuary in these times</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">of quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">how does someone set up these facilities</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">what services do they usually offer so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">assume we&#39;re talking about biological</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">research stations and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:54.120" style="s2">know that Heather and I have actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">talked about it but of course we just</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.120" end="00:06:00.320" style="s2">emerged from the tipitina biological</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">station in Ecuador at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.320" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">what was then called the novel</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">coronavirus was emerging and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.690" style="s2">the two things sit closely together in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">our minds of course they&#39;ve been great</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.690" end="00:06:15.419" style="s2">referee refuges they&#39;re not cheap to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:19.530" style="s2">at that&#39;s for sure just think about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.419" end="00:06:22.169" style="s2">idea of having a station deep in in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:24.210" style="s2">case the Amazon rainforest where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.169" end="00:06:26.340" style="s2">forest is constantly trying to reclaim</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.210" end="00:06:29.810" style="s2">all of the building materials and every</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.340" end="00:06:33.509" style="s2">morsel of food have to be brought in by</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.810" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">boats and and the like so anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.509" end="00:06:38.250" style="s2">it&#39;s an expensive operation to run</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:40.199" style="s2">they&#39;re not easy to set up and on top of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.250" end="00:06:42.120" style="s2">all of the practical details</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.199" end="00:06:44.789" style="s2">if they&#39;re gonna be any good they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.120" end="00:06:47.219" style="s2">to be somewhere with a diverse biota</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.789" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">which inevitably means a tremendous</p>

<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:13.510" style="s2">would be worth advancing in this which</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:18.850" style="s2">is that very few people know who he is I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.510" end="00:10:20.650" style="s2">would certainly want to see him involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:23.470" style="s2">in solution making and actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:25.510" style="s2">something I didn&#39;t say the catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.470" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">failure of our stream threw me a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.510" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">bit one of the things I would advocate</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:33.370" style="s2">for the general election is that we stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">pestering candidates about the policies</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.370" end="00:10:37.720" style="s2">that they would enact presidents don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:39.580" style="s2">make policy they lead it affects policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.720" end="00:10:42.280" style="s2">but what I would suggest would be an</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.580" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">appropriate substitute for the absurd</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.280" end="00:10:47.560" style="s2">spectacle of asking presidential</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.970" style="s2">candidates to be detailed about where</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.560" end="00:10:51.370" style="s2">they would get the money to do this on</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.970" end="00:10:55.390" style="s2">that and you know what I would advocate</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.370" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">is that instead we have them outline who</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.390" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">they would bring into an administration</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:01.780" style="s2">and take advice from that that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:03.430" style="s2">actually a basis on which we can judge</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.780" end="00:11:05.390" style="s2">somebody if they&#39;re listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.430" end="00:11:08.150" style="s2">right sort of folks and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.390" end="00:11:13.130" style="s2">it is nobody can do it all a president</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.150" end="00:11:14.210" style="s2">has to take a tremendous amount of input</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.130" end="00:11:14.900" style="s2">from people who know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.210" end="00:11:16.940" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.900" end="00:11:18.170" style="s2">and they have to delegate to other</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.940" end="00:11:20.420" style="s2">people that&#39;s what they do they take</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.170" end="00:11:23.720" style="s2">input from others and they delegate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.420" end="00:11:25.310" style="s2">so the question of to whom they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.720" end="00:11:27.050" style="s2">delegate and from whom would they</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.310" end="00:11:28.760" style="s2">solicit information seems highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.050" end="00:11:32.150" style="s2">relevant I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.760" end="00:11:35.330" style="s2">Jordan would be an excellent candidate</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.150" end="00:11:38.960" style="s2">for supplying insight on many topics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.330" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">I would hope that where this where this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.960" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">plan to work that he would be involved</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">that way okay most people have heard</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:49.460" style="s2">about sexual dimorphism and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:52.640" style="s2">hermaphroditism but is there such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.460" end="00:11:54.770" style="s2">thing as sexual polymorphism and if so</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.640" end="00:11:57.220" style="s2">how would that arise evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.770" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">thank you for doing the podcast so often</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.220" end="00:12:04.520" style="s2">well if I understand the question oh no</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:06.110" style="s2">wait a second well the question could</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.520" end="00:12:09.020" style="s2">mean one of two things either it could</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.110" end="00:12:12.740" style="s2">mean sexual dimorphism as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.020" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">polymorphism as in more sexist than two</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.740" end="00:12:17.510" style="s2">and the interesting thing is that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:20.510" style="s2">general that&#39;s not what we see that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.510" end="00:12:22.370" style="s2">see asexual organisms and we see sexual</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.510" end="00:12:24.380" style="s2">organisms in which there are two sexes</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.370" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">and then we see weird stuff and things</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.380" end="00:12:28.550" style="s2">like fun G where sometimes there can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:30.950" style="s2">many many many mating types which aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.550" end="00:12:34.370" style="s2">exactly sexes but nonetheless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.950" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">something but maybe the question here is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.370" end="00:12:42.170" style="s2">actually asking about like size</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.570" style="s2">dimorphism where there are more than two</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.170" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">sides where it&#39;s not like males are</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.570" end="00:12:49.250" style="s2">large and females are small or sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.490" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the reverse in some species but</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.250" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">there could be many sizes and in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:58.070" style="s2">do see this in some places we see things</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">like female strategies yes that is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.070" end="00:13:04.430" style="s2">actual term for it female strategies in</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">which males take on a female like form</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.430" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">often this is in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:13.220" style="s2">something like a mating ball where I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">seen it in garter snakes for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.220" end="00:13:17.210" style="s2">where garter snakes will come out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.780" end="00:13:18.339" style="s2">hibernation and females will effectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.210" end="00:13:20.050" style="s2">be mob</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.339" end="00:13:23.860" style="s2">by males and they will be driven into</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.050" end="00:13:27.639" style="s2">the center of a ball of males trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.860" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">mate and one strategy for getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.639" end="00:13:32.199" style="s2">female is not to be bigger but to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:34.269" style="s2">small and female like and to be driven</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.199" end="00:13:36.339" style="s2">by the group who are confused about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.269" end="00:13:42.129" style="s2">sexual identity of the individual toward</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.339" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">the female so that can create a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.129" end="00:13:47.079" style="s2">third form you know a male and female</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:49.509" style="s2">like form I by the way I&#39;ve also seen</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.079" end="00:13:51.879" style="s2">that in newts in rough skin newts in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.509" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">Pacific Northwest where I do not believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.879" end="00:14:05.829" style="s2">it was a known behavior but I&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.680" end="00:14:10.990" style="s2">multiple times so anyway okay next</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.829" end="00:14:12.129" style="s2">question if XY offspring is costly for</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.569" end="00:14:42.879" style="s2">okay I think I understand the question</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.939" end="00:14:46.209" style="s2">the question is asking whether or not if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.879" end="00:14:48.009" style="s2">there are costs to having offspring of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.209" end="00:14:49.809" style="s2">one sex or another in this case the cost</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.009" end="00:14:51.610" style="s2">is being attributed to the males and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.809" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">this follows from something we talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.610" end="00:14:57.550" style="s2">about last time where males could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:14:59.740" style="s2">costly to a female because they would</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.550" end="00:15:02.379" style="s2">have potentially an interest in draining</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.740" end="00:15:03.970" style="s2">the female more than the female would</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.379" end="00:15:09.029" style="s2">have an interest in being drained by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.970" end="00:15:11.230" style="s2">pregnancy or by the the loading of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.029" end="00:15:15.160" style="s2">actually it can&#39;t be in the egg case but</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.230" end="00:15:17.980" style="s2">but in any case the point is do animals</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.160" end="00:15:22.029" style="s2">do females have the ability to select</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.980" end="00:15:24.689" style="s2">against something like male offspring in</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.029" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">the womb or select against male</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.689" end="00:15:30.660" style="s2">y-bearing sperm before fertilization in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">order to adjust the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.660" end="00:15:35.129" style="s2">sex of the offspring that they produce</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:36.509" style="s2">now this actually follows quite well</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.129" end="00:15:38.279" style="s2">from something called the Traverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.509" end="00:15:40.649" style="s2">Willard hypothesis Bob Trivers</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.279" end="00:15:45.149" style="s2">was an undergraduate mentor for Heather</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.649" end="00:15:47.939" style="s2">and me he&#39;s still a good friend and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.149" end="00:15:50.100" style="s2">is anyway one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.939" end="00:15:54.300" style="s2">evolutionary thinkers of certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.100" end="00:15:58.620" style="s2">20 20th century and arguably the 21st as</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.300" end="00:16:01.949" style="s2">well so what Traverse and Willard argued</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.620" end="00:16:03.779" style="s2">was that we know from Fisheries work</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.949" end="00:16:05.819" style="s2">that males and females are on average</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.779" end="00:16:08.009" style="s2">equally valuable therefore there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.819" end="00:16:10.829" style="s2">inherent advantage to producing males or</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.009" end="00:16:12.089" style="s2">females that that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.829" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">advantage to producing whichever one</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.089" end="00:16:19.949" style="s2">might be scarce but that if a female</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">knows what quality of offspring she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.949" end="00:16:24.449" style="s2">going to produce she might then have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:26.759" style="s2">bias in one direction or another that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.449" end="00:16:29.459" style="s2">to say because most males are losers</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.759" end="00:16:31.050" style="s2">sorry guys most males are losers if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.459" end="00:16:32.939" style="s2">were going to produce offspring without</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:34.920" style="s2">enough resource so that they were likely</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.939" end="00:16:37.290" style="s2">to end up not being highly competitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.920" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">you&#39;d be better off producing female</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.290" end="00:16:41.069" style="s2">offspring who would be almost guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:42.779" style="s2">to find a mate if you were gonna produce</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.069" end="00:16:44.100" style="s2">really high-quality offspring let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.779" end="00:16:45.899" style="s2">you had a great year and your</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.100" end="00:16:47.939" style="s2">competitors didn&#39;t then you might want</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.899" end="00:16:51.540" style="s2">to produce male offspring because a male</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.939" end="00:16:54.029" style="s2">who wins and many of these systems tends</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.540" end="00:16:59.819" style="s2">to out reproduce even a highly</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.029" end="00:17:05.010" style="s2">successful female so the question here</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.819" end="00:17:07.409" style="s2">suggests an analog for this and really</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">the point is yes the logic works there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.409" end="00:17:12.059" style="s2">some evidence for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:15.059" style="s2">it is difficult mechanistically this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.059" end="00:17:17.400" style="s2">difficult to arrange but it is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.059" end="00:17:22.049" style="s2">impossible and therefore evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.400" end="00:17:25.740" style="s2">we do expect to find solutions and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.049" end="00:17:30.630" style="s2">see what yeah and so you know healthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.740" end="00:17:33.530" style="s2">parents healthy and maybe well-fed</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.630" end="00:17:36.630" style="s2">parents might be more likely to produce</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.530" end="00:17:40.530" style="s2">male offspring in this case so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.630" end="00:17:42.090" style="s2">I&#39;d like to see a really large study</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.530" end="00:17:44.190" style="s2">that was able to demonstrate the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.090" end="00:17:44.760" style="s2">existence of this force or the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.190" end="00:17:46.170" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.760" end="00:17:54.210" style="s2">for it in humans but it&#39;s certainly been</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.170" end="00:18:00.410" style="s2">seen in many other creatures okay um</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.210" end="00:18:03.060" style="s2">let&#39;s see yeah Brett which hypotheses of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.410" end="00:18:06.120" style="s2">origin of life on earth do you lean</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.060" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">towards RNA genetics first metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.120" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">first chemical synthesis panspermia</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.820" end="00:18:21.990" style="s2">thermo thermo synthesis do you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.750" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2">know what that&#39;s supposed to read here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.990" end="00:18:28.170" style="s2">the thing yeah do you have one yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.260" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">is probably what that says this is one</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.170" end="00:18:32.520" style="s2">of these questions which it would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:34.530" style="s2">wonderful to know the answer it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.520" end="00:18:36.600" style="s2">important to know that there are answers</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.530" end="00:18:39.450" style="s2">that would suffice there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.600" end="00:18:42.840" style="s2">things that we can see so we can I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.450" end="00:18:46.170" style="s2">see enough to strongly suspect that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.840" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">RNA world pre-existed the DNA to RNA</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.170" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">world we can see that in for example the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.710" end="00:18:59.030" style="s2">ribosome which remains it functions like</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">a a protein enzyme but made from for RNA</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.030" end="00:19:04.140" style="s2">nucleotides therefore it&#39;s much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:07.490" style="s2">and clumsier and slower than a an RNA</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.140" end="00:19:09.960" style="s2">and then a protein based enzyme would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">but as for all the way back at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.960" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">beginning what sparked it I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:17.460" style="s2">anything to suggest panspermia yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean evidence couldn&#39;t emerge</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.460" end="00:19:21.630" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t seen anything that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:24.020" style="s2">lead us to hypothesize that extra step</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.630" end="00:19:26.970" style="s2">was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.020" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">so anyway I feel about it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.970" end="00:19:34.560" style="s2">like you know the origin of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s important that something explained</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.560" end="00:19:38.610" style="s2">it in other words it&#39;s important that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:40.380" style="s2">be explicable there are people who might</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.610" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">specialize in figuring out what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.380" end="00:19:45.690" style="s2">exact answer was but it&#39;s kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:48.450" style="s2">the same type of question as how does</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.690" end="00:19:51.000" style="s2">evolution work and so in some sense I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.450" end="00:19:55.140" style="s2">don&#39;t really feel like how did it start</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.000" end="00:19:56.850" style="s2">is in my area of specialty</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.140" end="00:19:58.380" style="s2">so in some sense I&#39;m as excited to learn</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.850" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">what the answer might be has anybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.380" end="00:20:01.720" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2">and no I don&#39;t have a personal pet</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.720" end="00:20:09.580" style="s2">hypothesis okay within those species of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.450" end="00:20:11.860" style="s2">animals that past the mirror self</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.580" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">recognition test not all individuals</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.860" end="00:20:15.940" style="s2">passed the test</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:18.789" style="s2">what would a population of a species</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.940" end="00:20:21.390" style="s2">that has more self-awareness be at an</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.789" end="00:20:24.270" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.390" end="00:20:26.070" style="s2">would that population of a species that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.270" end="00:20:27.809" style="s2">has more self-awareness being an</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.070" end="00:20:29.820" style="s2">evolutionary advantage it was self</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.809" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">recognition a case of convergent</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.820" end="00:20:34.950" style="s2">evolution self recognition will</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">definitely be a case of convergent</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.950" end="00:20:40.260" style="s2">evolution how do we know that because</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">the taxa that show it are widely</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.260" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">separated and their common ancestors we</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2">can infer in many of these cases didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">happen so for example elephants and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:54.780" style="s2">primates are distantly separated and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:58.410" style="s2">they both show it and so their common</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.780" end="00:21:00.030" style="s2">ancestor would be a creature for which</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.410" end="00:21:02.120" style="s2">we have no reason to think that it had</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.030" end="00:21:04.380" style="s2">this capacity so I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.120" end="00:21:05.549" style="s2">incredibly fascinating you know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.380" end="00:21:08.340" style="s2">there are lots of things that work like</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.549" end="00:21:12.600" style="s2">this grief also seems to be convergently</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.340" end="00:21:16.020" style="s2">evolved so next part of the question is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.600" end="00:21:19.470" style="s2">is there an advantage to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.020" end="00:21:21.690" style="s2">self-awareness undoubtedly there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.470" end="00:21:23.309" style="s2">advantage to it it has a cost and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.690" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">emerges multiple times on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.309" end="00:21:28.110" style="s2">evolutionary tree and persists where it</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:31.650" style="s2">does emerge and that says it has a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.110" end="00:21:34.290" style="s2">benefit does it have a cost of course it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.650" end="00:21:35.910" style="s2">has a cost is it a net benefit obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.290" end="00:21:37.590" style="s2">in some places it is would it be a net</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.910" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">benefit to everybody here&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.590" end="00:21:40.470" style="s2">suspect is at the heart of your question</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.820" end="00:21:43.350" style="s2">no I don&#39;t think it would be a net</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.470" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">benefit to every creature to have it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.350" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s every reason to think that</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.080" end="00:22:38.430" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question so the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:40.470" style="s2">we humans have a lifecycle that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.430" end="00:22:43.560" style="s2">fairly consistent until relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.470" end="00:22:46.650" style="s2">recently consistent enough that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.560" end="00:22:48.030" style="s2">solution evolved to match the set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.650" end="00:22:49.890" style="s2">problems that needed to be solved now I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.030" end="00:22:53.310" style="s2">still think there&#39;s lots of mystery here</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.890" end="00:22:57.410" style="s2">I&#39;m waiting for somebody to deliver a</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.860" end="00:23:14.390" style="s2">there are some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.670" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">perspectives on this and in fact I&#39;m in</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:22.830" style="s2">quite a lot to say about this but what</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.250" end="00:23:25.110" style="s2">we really need is Darwinian dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.830" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">just the same way Darwinian psychology</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.110" end="00:23:30.270" style="s2">has begun to explore the apparatus of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.820" style="s2">the mind and do so in a in a rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.270" end="00:23:35.460" style="s2">evolutionary way we need this for</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.820" end="00:23:37.650" style="s2">dentistry sorry Radford that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.460" end="00:23:40.410" style="s2">bit beyond the questions you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.650" end="00:23:42.990" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say some creatures do</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.410" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">have an essentially infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.990" end="00:23:49.410" style="s2">teeth sharks have effectively a conveyor</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:52.320" style="s2">belt of teeth that just kind of puts new</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.410" end="00:23:55.230" style="s2">teeth forward as necessary and you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">note that sharks sometimes live a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.230" end="00:23:59.430" style="s2">very long time some of the longest lived</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">vertebrates that is to say the longest</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.430" end="00:24:03.720" style="s2">living individual vertebrates that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:06.090" style="s2">know of on earth are sharks how would</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.720" end="00:24:08.010" style="s2">you build a creature whose teeth were</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.090" end="00:24:10.560" style="s2">gonna wear down if it could live</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.010" end="00:24:13.920" style="s2">hundreds of years you know up under the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.560" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">Arctic ice for example well if you build</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.920" end="00:24:17.580" style="s2">it to grow new teeth and to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.080" style="s2">constantly pushing new ones forward then</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.580" end="00:24:20.160" style="s2">it would always have sharp teeth even</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.080" end="00:24:21.810" style="s2">when it was old so that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.160" end="00:24:23.500" style="s2">solution for that we don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.810" end="00:24:25.720" style="s2">because we don&#39;t live that long</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.500" end="00:24:28.090" style="s2">live a period of time that actually two</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.720" end="00:24:30.820" style="s2">sets of teeth pretty much gets us there</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.090" end="00:24:33.070" style="s2">two sets of teeth also solves a problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.820" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">of growth where you&#39;re trying to do one</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.070" end="00:24:36.160" style="s2">set of things while your head is still</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">relatively small and as your head</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.160" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">matures you need to start doing another</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.460" style="s2">set of things and so it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">elegant solution that we&#39;ve now made</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.460" end="00:24:48.040" style="s2">inelegant by eating foods that our</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:49.420" style="s2">ancestors wouldn&#39;t have eaten living</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.040" end="00:24:52.300" style="s2">longer than our ancestors would have</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.420" end="00:24:53.890" style="s2">tended to and lastly Rafferty I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.300" end="00:24:55.480" style="s2">can&#39;t help but continue to go on in your</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.890" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">question I&#39;m so tickled that you would</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.480" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">ask it think about the predicament of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:04.060" style="s2">elephants so elephants have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:06.580" style="s2">intermediate system between our system</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.060" end="00:25:08.380" style="s2">and the shark system where you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.580" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">generating more teeth so what elephants</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.380" end="00:25:12.670" style="s2">have is a set of teeth that moves</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.250" style="s2">forward over a lifetime right and I sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.670" end="00:25:16.570" style="s2">of get pushed off the front but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.250" end="00:25:18.130" style="s2">a limited number of them it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.570" end="00:25:20.140" style="s2">sharks they can&#39;t just make more teeth</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.130" end="00:25:22.660" style="s2">so when we take elephants into things</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.140" end="00:25:24.310" style="s2">like zoos they tend to live longer than</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.660" end="00:25:25.540" style="s2">their wild counterparts and they run out</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.310" end="00:25:29.110" style="s2">of teeth which is a really serious</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.540" end="00:25:31.990" style="s2">problem so anyway there&#39;s a lot to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.110" end="00:25:33.820" style="s2">said about creatures living in novel</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.990" end="00:25:35.770" style="s2">environments and those novel</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:37.720" style="s2">environments creating problems that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.770" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">ancestors didn&#39;t have anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.720" end="00:25:42.540" style="s2">great question Rafferty keep it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.540" end="00:25:50.710" style="s2">Alena Chan tweeted no evidence supports</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">it showed up really well adapted right</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.259" end="00:27:00.279" style="s2">that&#39;s not supposed to happen what</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:03.369" style="s2">typically would happen is the virus</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.279" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">would emerge from a wild animal it would</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.369" end="00:27:07.509" style="s2">make the jump into humans and then it</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:09.999" style="s2">would spend a bunch of time evolving</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.509" end="00:27:11.769" style="s2">before it took off and became a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.999" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not what happened here it got</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:18.279" style="s2">boom it was off to the races so did it</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.239" end="00:27:22.269" style="s2">go through that evolutionary step that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.279" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">we expect in some other place if so it</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.269" end="00:27:26.649" style="s2">would be excellent to know where it was</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.539" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">support a search for the actual origin</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.090" end="00:27:35.169" style="s2">of this virus and we need to be</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.450" end="00:29:11.080" style="s2">spot a single substantive point so my</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:13.900" style="s2">sense is he had an idea that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.080" end="00:29:16.540" style="s2">lot of hunger out there for some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.900" end="00:29:18.280" style="s2">takedown of the IDW and he signed up for</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.540" end="00:29:20.440" style="s2">the role and when he got right down to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.280" end="00:29:22.180" style="s2">it not a lot added up because really</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:23.860" style="s2">what is there to complain about a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.180" end="00:29:26.620" style="s2">of heterodox thinkers being civil to</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.860" end="00:29:28.840" style="s2">each other so anyway I don&#39;t think very</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.620" end="00:29:31.810" style="s2">highly of it and as much as I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.840" end="00:29:34.540" style="s2">hopeful that Michael Brooks might mature</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.810" end="00:29:40.060" style="s2">into a rational voice on the left my</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.540" end="00:29:44.410" style="s2">hopes have dimmed on that front okay 16</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.060" end="00:29:46.540" style="s2">um somebody is saying they have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.410" end="00:29:50.230" style="s2">support rigorous public discourse yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.540" end="00:29:52.900" style="s2">rigorous public discourse perfect let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.230" end="00:29:54.400" style="s2">see listening from Yorkshire UK really</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.900" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">appreciate you guys thanks for all you</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.400" end="00:30:01.330" style="s2">do excellent thank you 18 get well soon</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:03.100" style="s2">Heather Heather isn&#39;t really sick she</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.330" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t have her voice which is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.100" end="00:30:06.430" style="s2">very uncomfortable thing she used to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:09.160" style="s2">through this when she was teaching every</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.430" end="00:30:11.080" style="s2">now and again where once the voice</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.160" end="00:30:13.000" style="s2">starts to go hoarse you try to speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.080" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">louder in order to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.000" end="00:30:16.090" style="s2">quietness and the voice and it would</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:17.290" style="s2">just go positive feedback to the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.090" end="00:30:18.610" style="s2">that he would completely lose her voice</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.290" end="00:30:21.820" style="s2">so we&#39;re trying to prevent that from</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.610" end="00:30:25.150" style="s2">happening but no she&#39;s not she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.820" end="00:30:30.400" style="s2">sick but anyway get loud soon how about</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.150" end="00:30:32.650" style="s2">that that seems closer okay would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.400" end="00:30:35.080" style="s2">make a separate video with these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.650" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">in Portland people need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.080" end="00:30:40.360" style="s2">see the dynamic in a more shareable form</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">I love your family yeah it might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.360" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">worth doing something like that I will</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:49.179" style="s2">say you know Andy know has done a great</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.820" style="s2">job of documenting what&#39;s going on we</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.179" end="00:30:53.589" style="s2">the anarchists in Portland and he&#39;s paid</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.820" end="00:30:55.749" style="s2">a high price for it he&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.589" end="00:30:57.789" style="s2">courageous you know I don&#39;t love</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.749" end="00:31:00.309" style="s2">everything Andy does or some stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.789" end="00:31:04.239" style="s2">troubles me but the fact is he&#39;s young</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.309" end="00:31:07.179" style="s2">he is highly capable he&#39;s been on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.239" end="00:31:09.190" style="s2">story longer than anyone and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.179" end="00:31:11.289" style="s2">some sense I think we owe him a debt of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:14.259" style="s2">gratitude he saw this coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.289" end="00:31:17.769" style="s2">extent that there was mayhem last night</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.259" end="00:31:19.239" style="s2">in the streets of Portland and he now is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.769" end="00:31:29.859" style="s2">in a position to say I told you so about</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.239" end="00:31:35.379" style="s2">it okay let&#39;s see let&#39;s see is now a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.859" end="00:31:38.169" style="s2">good time to buy a gun if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.379" end="00:31:39.969" style="s2">already that seems like a loaded</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.169" end="00:31:43.899" style="s2">question and that seems like a decent</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.969" end="00:31:45.129" style="s2">pun is now a good time to buy a gun if</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.899" end="00:31:47.229" style="s2">you haven&#39;t already know it&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.129" end="00:31:49.629" style="s2">time to buy a gun because the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.229" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">the gun store out the door as I in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.629" end="00:31:52.929" style="s2">neighborhood at least when I pass the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.339" style="s2">gun store there are people literally</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.929" end="00:31:56.589" style="s2">lined up outside or at least there were</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.339" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">right before lockdown so just</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.589" end="00:32:01.599" style="s2">economically speaking I would say supply</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:03.489" style="s2">appears to be low demand appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.599" end="00:32:06.070" style="s2">high that suggests the price of guns</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.489" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">will be high so I&#39;m just gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.070" end="00:32:11.889" style="s2">strictly economic stance and say nope</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:17.820" style="s2">you should wait for demand to drop and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.889" end="00:32:20.679" style="s2">supply to increase okay look I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.820" end="00:32:22.719" style="s2">two questions how would we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.679" end="00:32:25.690" style="s2">Congress which has the same pressure</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.719" end="00:32:27.729" style="s2">from the parties and what safeguards do</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.690" end="00:32:30.549" style="s2">we institute to keep people from gaming</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.729" end="00:32:32.259" style="s2">the system yang and McCreevy are yang</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.549" end="00:32:35.109" style="s2">and McRaven unviable</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.259" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">I believe Yang and McRaven together</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.109" end="00:32:40.359" style="s2">would be unviable maybe I&#39;m naive but</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:42.219" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.359" end="00:32:43.570" style="s2">there are more unbel people out there</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.219" end="00:32:45.999" style="s2">than you would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.570" end="00:32:49.929" style="s2">but to the extent that we have a duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.999" end="00:32:51.129" style="s2">of influence peddlers they have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.929" end="00:32:53.349" style="s2">interest in keeping the unenviable</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.129" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">people away that&#39;s what the primaries</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.349" end="00:32:59.379" style="s2">are for so in any case what do we do at</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:00.849" style="s2">the Congress well here&#39;s the thing if</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.379" end="00:33:02.400" style="s2">you think really hard you&#39;ll realize</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.849" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">that there are bound</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.400" end="00:33:08.430" style="s2">be three kinds of people okay you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">people who will do the right thing no</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.430" end="00:33:13.800" style="s2">matter what probably not a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:16.110" style="s2">in Congress maybe a few you got people</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.800" end="00:33:17.730" style="s2">who will do the wrong thing no matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.110" end="00:33:19.320" style="s2">what they&#39;re just committed to doing bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.730" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">stuff probably not a lot of those in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.320" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">Congress either all right it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.970" end="00:33:23.700" style="s2">a very good strategy so how would you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:25.530" style="s2">get to Congress if you were that dumb</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:28.710" style="s2">and then there gonna be a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.530" end="00:33:30.900" style="s2">in the middle who will do the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.710" end="00:33:33.240" style="s2">thing if they&#39;re not left with better</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.900" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">choices but might rather not live in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.240" end="00:33:38.820" style="s2">corrupt system and so I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:40.890" style="s2">gave the Congress an opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.820" end="00:33:42.150" style="s2">the right thing to feel good about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.890" end="00:33:43.560" style="s2">you know to be able to look their kids</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.150" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">in the eye all that sort of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.560" end="00:33:47.400" style="s2">think you&#39;d find a good number of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:51.030" style="s2">were up to the challenge not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.400" end="00:33:52.530" style="s2">the ones who aren&#39;t I say we I say we</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.030" end="00:33:54.420" style="s2">throw those bums out I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.530" end="00:33:57.090" style="s2">yesterday so anyway what would that look</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.420" end="00:33:59.090" style="s2">like if we actually put this plan into</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.090" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">motion and it worked and you had</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.090" end="00:34:05.220" style="s2">president and vice president governing</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:07.590" style="s2">together as a team with no affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.220" end="00:34:09.960" style="s2">to either of the parties Wow would they</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.590" end="00:34:11.700" style="s2">have a tremendous amount of power behind</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.960" end="00:34:13.320" style="s2">them that came from the actual people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.700" end="00:34:15.570" style="s2">and Wow would that create a large</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:17.250" style="s2">incentive for people in the Congress who</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.570" end="00:34:19.740" style="s2">were capable of doing the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.250" end="00:34:21.990" style="s2">come on over to the right side so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.740" end="00:34:27.510" style="s2">do it let&#39;s just get rid of those two</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.990" end="00:34:31.980" style="s2">parties they&#39;re so god-awful okay hmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.510" end="00:34:33.630" style="s2">Brett this one is for me awesome go buy</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.980" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">the ingredients to make egg-drop soup</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.630" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">for Heather for her voice it works like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">a charm in this person&#39;s experience I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:45.330" style="s2">recommend those free-range eggs that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:48.510" style="s2">have the hens backstories included</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.330" end="00:34:51.419" style="s2">inside the cartons and cost like $5.99</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.510" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">can I ask you a question it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.419" end="00:34:55.380" style="s2">exactly an answer to what you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:34:59.670" style="s2">here I may try that could well could be</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.380" end="00:35:02.490" style="s2">the thing free-range eggs how far could</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.670" end="00:35:06.090" style="s2">they possibly get</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.490" end="00:35:08.369" style="s2">all right next question</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.090" end="00:35:10.170" style="s2">how could a critical mass of people be</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.369" end="00:35:13.080" style="s2">convinced to vote for a ticket that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.170" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">only half from their side over the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.080" end="00:35:20.190" style="s2">that&#39;s all from their side here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:23.250" style="s2">thing people are sick of this crap they</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.190" end="00:35:25.740" style="s2">are sick to death of it if you provided</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.250" end="00:35:27.690" style="s2">them something that looked honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.740" end="00:35:29.700" style="s2">patriotic and where they didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.690" end="00:35:31.320" style="s2">it ended where there was some reason to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.700" end="00:35:33.540" style="s2">get up and be hopeful in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.320" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">lots and lots of people would be there</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.540" end="00:35:38.760" style="s2">the thing that prevents a plan like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.640" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">from coming into play is that people</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.760" end="00:35:42.330" style="s2">imagine from the get-go that because it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come through the door that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.330" end="00:35:46.350" style="s2">they&#39;ve been told is the only possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.190" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">way to get to the White House that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.350" end="00:35:51.869" style="s2">a non-starter but you have to think</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">beyond that the parties have by by</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.869" end="00:35:57.780" style="s2">advancing these two corrupt dimwits they</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:00.210" style="s2">have announced to us that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.780" end="00:36:03.600" style="s2">interested in leadership at a moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.210" end="00:36:05.820" style="s2">when absent leadership we could very</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.600" end="00:36:08.609" style="s2">well drive ourselves extinct we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.820" end="00:36:10.140" style="s2">have a civil war so at you know at what</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.609" end="00:36:11.910" style="s2">point do your parties announce they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.140" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">not interested in leadership and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.910" end="00:36:15.410" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to them I say it&#39;s time we</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:22.470" style="s2">listen let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.410" end="00:36:25.320" style="s2">all right great proposal Brett what are</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:27.750" style="s2">ways to spread these ideas to a large</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.320" end="00:36:30.600" style="s2">audience Joe Rogan has the platform and</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.750" end="00:36:31.320" style="s2">certainly wants to improve America thank</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">you sir</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.320" end="00:36:38.550" style="s2">thank you I don&#39;t know obviously I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:41.820" style="s2">Joe Rogan is maybe the most important</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.550" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">person in media today and for good</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.820" end="00:36:53.550" style="s2">reason I have to say Joe is exactly who</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">he seems to be and so his success it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.550" end="00:36:57.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t happen to a better guy would he</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">be interested in this I think he&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.780" end="00:37:02.820" style="s2">be interested in it if he thought there</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:04.680" style="s2">was a real chance but but yeah that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.820" end="00:37:07.410" style="s2">the obvious way how do you reach more</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.680" end="00:37:10.350" style="s2">people than have a chitchat with Joe</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.410" end="00:37:11.609" style="s2">Rogan about it or frankly Joe you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.350" end="00:37:12.840" style="s2">talk about it with anybody I&#39;ve put it</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.609" end="00:37:15.420" style="s2">on the table I&#39;d be happy to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.840" end="00:37:16.650" style="s2">what I forgot to say here that might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.420" end="00:37:19.829" style="s2">worth this guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.650" end="00:37:22.289" style="s2">but yeah wonderful um the idea is now</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.829" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">public domain let&#39;s spread it far and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.289" end="00:37:27.450" style="s2">wide okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">uh somebody just wants to thank me for</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.450" end="00:37:32.579" style="s2">our content great you&#39;re very welcome</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">all right the anarchists are being</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.579" end="00:37:37.230" style="s2">organized and exploited by the globalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:40.980" style="s2">you know I see this allegation a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.230" end="00:37:45.210" style="s2">I have no idea if it&#39;s accurate it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.980" end="00:37:47.010" style="s2">of those rabbit holes that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.210" end="00:37:50.430" style="s2">gone down maybe just because I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.010" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">had time or maybe because I secretly</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.430" end="00:37:57.690" style="s2">suspect it doesn&#39;t much matter I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:38:00.390" style="s2">the same extent that there&#39;s some web of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.690" end="00:38:02.609" style="s2">corruption that advances lackluster</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.390" end="00:38:04.589" style="s2">presidential candidates whose main</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.609" end="00:38:06.450" style="s2">purpose is to prevent real change from</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.589" end="00:38:09.210" style="s2">happening the extent that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.450" end="00:38:10.589" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not all that important that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.210" end="00:38:12.150" style="s2">we figure out the details of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.589" end="00:38:15.890" style="s2">corruption what&#39;s really important is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.150" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">that we figure our way out of it okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.890" end="00:38:20.789" style="s2">did I check the generational hormone</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:22.770" style="s2">theory yet its main premise is that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.789" end="00:38:24.779" style="s2">population cycles are driven by</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.770" end="00:38:26.460" style="s2">generationally fluctuating hormone</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.779" end="00:38:28.650" style="s2">levels and human populations are</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.460" end="00:38:29.819" style="s2">included here&#39;s the thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.650" end="00:38:32.730" style="s2">there&#39;s something to this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.819" end="00:38:34.980" style="s2">the hormone bit is a red herring there</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.730" end="00:38:36.690" style="s2">is a way in which generations follow</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.980" end="00:38:40.020" style="s2">some sort of pattern and many people</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.690" end="00:38:42.630" style="s2">have spotted it whether that has a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.020" end="00:38:44.760" style="s2">molecular explanation I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.630" end="00:38:46.680" style="s2">reason that it needs to the fact is each</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.760" end="00:38:49.230" style="s2">generation provides the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.680" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">environment for the next generation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.230" end="00:38:53.220" style="s2">because of that you would expect certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:54.660" style="s2">kinds of parents to produce certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.220" end="00:38:58.200" style="s2">kinds of offspring and you would get</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.660" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">this kind of repeating cycle so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.200" end="00:39:01.829" style="s2">there is something to the cycle I remain</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:04.980" style="s2">to be convinced that it has anything to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.829" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">do with hormones or more likely</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.980" end="00:39:10.529" style="s2">pheromones or whatever I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:12.289" style="s2">basically just a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.529" end="00:39:15.720" style="s2">environment and exposure</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.289" end="00:39:18.569" style="s2">okay what about tulsi gabbard</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.720" end="00:39:21.510" style="s2">mixed ethnicity a desire to end wars</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.569" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">could be a good path going forward and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.510" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">the fact that the Dems turned on her at</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:30.200" style="s2">the point she got 60%</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:31.940" style="s2">disapproval speaks volumes okay and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.200" end="00:39:36.440" style="s2">quite follow the end of that but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.940" end="00:39:39.190" style="s2">thing I actually like the idea of Tulsi</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.440" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">and I considered her for the second spot</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.190" end="00:39:43.580" style="s2">problem if she has some serious</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.740" style="s2">negatives which I&#39;m not sure she</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.580" end="00:39:47.570" style="s2">deserves but nonetheless the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.740" end="00:39:50.300" style="s2">important thing about this proposal is</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.570" end="00:39:53.720" style="s2">that it works well enough to get two</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.300" end="00:39:59.480" style="s2">patriots into the White House to govern</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.720" end="00:40:03.320" style="s2">as a team what I am not convinced of is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.480" end="00:40:05.720" style="s2">that Tulsi Gabbard is not too divisive</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.320" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">to make that happen I wish she wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.720" end="00:40:13.010" style="s2">but in particular she has a major</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:15.290" style="s2">stumbling block when it comes to Jews on</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.010" end="00:40:18.140" style="s2">the basis that she is perceived to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.290" end="00:40:21.020" style="s2">anti-israel now I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.140" end="00:40:23.750" style="s2">what I see but let&#39;s just say the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.020" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">important thing is that we get Patriots</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.750" end="00:40:26.840" style="s2">into the White House</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:30.110" style="s2">I personally believe Tulsi is a patriot</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.840" end="00:40:32.390" style="s2">and I believe she is all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.110" end="00:40:34.760" style="s2">that would be prerequisites for this the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.390" end="00:40:36.470" style="s2">question is really how electable would</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.760" end="00:40:38.330" style="s2">she be and I don&#39;t know the answer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.470" end="00:40:43.330" style="s2">open to being convinced that she&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.330" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">right person okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.330" end="00:40:48.440" style="s2">my president proposal doesn&#39;t address</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.840" style="s2">elections Congress or lobbyists to name</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.440" end="00:40:54.110" style="s2">only three major issues how does putting</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.840" end="00:40:57.620" style="s2">a new head on it cure a body politic</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.110" end="00:40:59.090" style="s2">that is diseased as deeply as ours seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.620" end="00:41:00.770" style="s2">to be great question</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.090" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">totally agree except that it does</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.770" end="00:41:07.390" style="s2">address it in a way which is if I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.800" end="00:41:10.550" style="s2">just for a second write the script from</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.390" end="00:41:12.410" style="s2">inauguration day never mind how we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.550" end="00:41:13.940" style="s2">there what it looks like I believe those</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.410" end="00:41:17.900" style="s2">questions are answerable too but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.940" end="00:41:21.620" style="s2">just say we did okay now you have two</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.900" end="00:41:25.450" style="s2">people walking in as potentially the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.620" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">heroes that have freed us from this</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.450" end="00:41:31.850" style="s2">corrupt fog that we&#39;ve lived under most</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.760" end="00:41:35.270" style="s2">of us for most of our lives so what kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.850" end="00:41:36.980" style="s2">of power do they have to confront the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.270" end="00:41:38.440" style="s2">corrupting influences I would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.980" end="00:41:41.740" style="s2">tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.440" end="00:41:43.890" style="s2">and as I said prerequisite to be in</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.740" end="00:41:48.190" style="s2">those spots from my perspective would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.890" end="00:41:49.750" style="s2">highly competent patriot and courageous</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.190" end="00:41:51.880" style="s2">you&#39;d have to be courageous to go up</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.750" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">against those forces but what better</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.880" end="00:41:58.869" style="s2">than people who are highly creative and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:42:00.849" style="s2">motivated to make America function to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.869" end="00:42:02.140" style="s2">figure out what the solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.849" end="00:42:03.430" style="s2">corruption problem is and I would love</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.140" end="00:42:05.380" style="s2">to see what they come up with I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.430" end="00:42:06.250" style="s2">to be involved in helping come up with</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.380" end="00:42:08.349" style="s2">something and I&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.250" end="00:42:10.500" style="s2">thinking on that front too but thanks</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.349" end="00:42:12.730" style="s2">for the question it&#39;s an excellent one</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.500" end="00:42:15.220" style="s2">okay you mentioned that Trump was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.730" end="00:42:18.190" style="s2">separate family do you think the GOP</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.220" end="00:42:20.589" style="s2">will drop Trump post Trump and do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.190" end="00:42:22.780" style="s2">think he will haunt all future GOP</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.589" end="00:42:26.380" style="s2">candidates it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.780" end="00:42:30.970" style="s2">question I don&#39;t think so at this point</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.380" end="00:42:34.780" style="s2">I think he is you know in narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.970" end="00:42:38.170" style="s2">terms he effectively decapitated the GOP</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.780" end="00:42:39.579" style="s2">and I think there was a time early on</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.170" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">where if they could have figured out how</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.579" end="00:42:46.089" style="s2">to rid themselves of him they would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:48.849" style="s2">but I think at some level it&#39;s a brutal</p>

<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">great question the there are really two</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.740" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">parts to the answer one is the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:33.940" style="s2">thing you can do I think to become a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:36.609" style="s2">great experimentalist research scientist</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.940" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">is put yourself through the mental</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.609" end="00:43:42.369" style="s2">exercise of generating hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:44.859" style="s2">generating useful predictions good ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.369" end="00:43:48.550" style="s2">and then figuring out what experiment</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.859" end="00:43:49.869" style="s2">would would actually successfully test</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.550" end="00:43:50.990" style="s2">for them so you can do that a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.990" end="00:43:58.510" style="s2">if I can give you one a slightly bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.110" end="00:44:01.670" style="s2">piece of advice I got very good at</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.510" end="00:44:03.380" style="s2">reinventing the wheel which reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.670" end="00:44:04.730" style="s2">the wheel has a very bad name right</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:06.890" style="s2">people think reinventing the wheel is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.730" end="00:44:08.660" style="s2">wasting your time reinventing the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.890" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">in science can mean generating a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.660" end="00:44:13.160" style="s2">hypothesis not knowing whether anybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">has come up with it before coming up</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.160" end="00:44:16.670" style="s2">with the predictions that follow from it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:18.710" style="s2">the experiments you would run all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.670" end="00:44:20.630" style="s2">those things and then you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.710" end="00:44:22.220" style="s2">library very frequently you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.630" end="00:44:23.600" style="s2">somebody did have the hypothesis before</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.220" end="00:44:25.610" style="s2">and they went through the work of</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.600" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">testing it and what you get to do then</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.610" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">is check how good you were at figuring</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:33.230" style="s2">out a what they would find be how you</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:35.030" style="s2">would test it all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.230" end="00:44:37.580" style="s2">you&#39;re going to need to know so it might</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.030" end="00:44:39.410" style="s2">take you years to generate a good</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.410" end="00:44:43.340" style="s2">from it and then run the experiments</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.180" end="00:44:45.290" style="s2">where it would take you hours to do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.340" end="00:44:47.180" style="s2">mentally and then check how you did</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.290" end="00:44:49.640" style="s2">relative to the people who did the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.180" end="00:44:51.710" style="s2">relevant work so you can train yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.640" end="00:44:53.480" style="s2">by checking against what&#39;s already been</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.710" end="00:44:55.460" style="s2">done and I think that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.480" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">useful technique we don&#39;t teach people</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.460" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">enough of we tend to teach them the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:00.380" style="s2">results of experiments as if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:02.090" style="s2">key thing rather than put them through</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.380" end="00:45:07.250" style="s2">the exercise of generating them</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.090" end="00:45:09.290" style="s2">themselves good luck by the way ok if</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.250" end="00:45:12.110" style="s2">the virus was lab generated and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.290" end="00:45:13.640" style="s2">therefore highly exploratory is it more</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.110" end="00:45:15.260" style="s2">likely that the virus would take an</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.420" end="00:45:27.890" style="s2">general great question I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:30.920" style="s2">know I think in general my concern is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.890" end="00:45:33.770" style="s2">that we not give the virus more room in</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.920" end="00:45:36.100" style="s2">which to evolve that the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.770" end="00:45:38.300" style="s2">becomes more frightening the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.100" end="00:45:40.190" style="s2">instances of it exists in the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.300" end="00:45:42.770" style="s2">because each of those instances is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.190" end="00:45:45.140" style="s2">opportunity for innovations and so even</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.770" end="00:45:47.390" style="s2">if it evolves in the direction of being</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.140" end="00:45:49.790" style="s2">more benign I don&#39;t want it to be more</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.390" end="00:45:51.980" style="s2">persistent and since what it is trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.790" end="00:45:54.320" style="s2">to do is persist I&#39;d like to give it as</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.980" end="00:45:56.810" style="s2">few opportunities to discover new ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.320" end="00:46:00.410" style="s2">of persisting as possible and so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.810" end="00:46:03.170" style="s2">means effectively blocking access to new</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.410" end="00:46:04.010" style="s2">people not only people anything it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.170" end="00:46:07.340" style="s2">infect but prime</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.010" end="00:46:09.350" style="s2">Merilee people and that if we were to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.340" end="00:46:12.430" style="s2">that the chances of us stamping it out</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.350" end="00:46:15.590" style="s2">the way the original Tsar&#39;s Cove</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.430" end="00:46:17.090" style="s2">disappeared are increased and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.590" end="00:46:20.950" style="s2">really what we should be hoping for is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.090" end="00:46:23.300" style="s2">to drive it to zero and the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.950" end="00:46:26.840" style="s2">innovation room it has the less likely</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.300" end="00:46:27.380" style="s2">we are to succeed at that all right next</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.840" end="00:46:32.930" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.380" end="00:46:36.380" style="s2">hello hello back let&#39;s see next question</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.930" end="00:46:39.310" style="s2">recently there&#39;s been wide interest in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.380" end="00:46:42.830" style="s2">scientific evidence for benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.310" end="00:46:45.290" style="s2">meditation especially that of Zen</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.830" end="00:46:46.430" style="s2">Buddhism what&#39;s your opinion funny you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.290" end="00:46:50.120" style="s2">should ask</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.430" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">I suck at meditating I&#39;m really almost</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.120" end="00:46:54.440" style="s2">impossibly bad at it I do other things</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:57.320" style="s2">that I think have some of the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.440" end="00:47:01.730" style="s2">of it but I just really don&#39;t have very</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.320" end="00:47:06.940" style="s2">much hope of getting good I did I was on</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.730" end="00:47:09.620" style="s2">a panel with Sam Harris in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.940" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">year ago year and a half ago something</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.620" end="00:47:15.620" style="s2">and he gave a workshop and anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.950" end="00:47:16.250" style="s2">enjoyed it but I still don&#39;t feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.620" end="00:47:19.160" style="s2">was any good at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.250" end="00:47:21.380" style="s2">that said scientifically speaking I</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.160" end="00:47:24.680" style="s2">frequently find that when I follow my</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.380" end="00:47:26.570" style="s2">own understanding of biology and I carry</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.680" end="00:47:28.370" style="s2">it through to its logical conclusion I</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.570" end="00:47:30.740" style="s2">land somewhere that sounds to me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.370" end="00:47:33.140" style="s2">like what I understand Buddhism to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.740" end="00:47:35.330" style="s2">believe so I think there&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.140" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">Buddhism there&#39;s probably a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.330" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">meditation and so anyway if it works for</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">you I think do it it sure isn&#39;t gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:47.150" style="s2">harmful to you and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:48.650" style="s2">it&#39;s philosophically deep you know by</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.150" end="00:47:52.730" style="s2">virtue of being connected to Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.650" end="00:47:57.530" style="s2">all the better okay can leftists reclaim</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.730" end="00:47:59.330" style="s2">free thinking and labor reform yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.530" end="00:48:01.370" style="s2">is a tough one I think we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.330" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">broader minded about what leftists are</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.370" end="00:48:06.800" style="s2">you know and I said and it resonated for</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:09.050" style="s2">some people on a past podcast that what</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:11.570" style="s2">makes me a progressive is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.050" end="00:48:14.450" style="s2">I know that we absolutely need progress</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.570" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">of a major form or we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.450" end="00:48:17.690" style="s2">extinct and so therefore I have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:18.980" style="s2">progressive but</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.690" end="00:48:20.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m signed up for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.980" end="00:48:22.490" style="s2">things that progressives tend to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.450" end="00:48:23.960" style="s2">advocate for I think this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.490" end="00:48:26.900" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.960" end="00:48:29.000" style="s2">in some sense we need an enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.900" end="00:48:30.980" style="s2">left to figure out what progress looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.000" end="00:48:33.560" style="s2">like and at the point that we have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.980" end="00:48:36.350" style="s2">enlightened left doing that then all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.560" end="00:48:39.950" style="s2">other things will follow naturally can</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.350" end="00:48:41.510" style="s2">we reclaim the left from the numskulls</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.950" end="00:48:43.070" style="s2">who are in charge of it at the moment I</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.510" end="00:48:45.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think that should be our objective</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.070" end="00:48:49.640" style="s2">I think we should make them obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.320" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">that&#39;s the better plan okay Brett please</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.640" end="00:48:53.960" style="s2">take a moment to read this when you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:57.890" style="s2">an opportunity and it comes with a URL</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.960" end="00:49:00.740" style="s2">that I do not recognize Oh looks like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.890" end="00:49:03.110" style="s2">the hunt for patient zero I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.740" end="00:49:04.580" style="s2">who patient zero would be in such a URL</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.110" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">but I will look at it anyway it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.580" end="00:49:11.540" style="s2">interesting story okay what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:14.810" style="s2">about the sentiment my voice won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.540" end="00:49:18.290" style="s2">heard unless I smash bricks into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.810" end="00:49:20.750" style="s2">store windows I don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.290" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">sentiment I don&#39;t think it works and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.750" end="00:49:25.340" style="s2">frankly I think it&#39;s typically a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:28.550" style="s2">rationalization by people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.340" end="00:49:31.250" style="s2">smash bricks into windows because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.550" end="00:49:38.090" style="s2">fun so anyway yeah I don&#39;t think very</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.250" end="00:49:40.820" style="s2">much of it hmm chickens walk in a big</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.820" end="00:49:48.230" style="s2">just in time every night so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.670" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">get very far no no no no no no you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.230" end="00:49:53.420" style="s2">I&#39;m asking how far free-range chickens</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:55.880" style="s2">could go I was asking about free-range</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.420" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">eggs which if they can get anywhere at</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.880" end="00:50:02.510" style="s2">all it&#39;s basically just downhill okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">love you Brett</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.510" end="00:50:07.700" style="s2">but the center-right candidate will</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:10.100" style="s2">quickly be labeled a Nazi and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.700" end="00:50:16.040" style="s2">center-left candidate a socialist the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.100" end="00:50:18.290" style="s2">idea is DOA I am oh well I disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.040" end="00:50:21.650" style="s2">I would spell that out if I was more</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.290" end="00:50:23.030" style="s2">confident of my spelling yeah look</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.650" end="00:50:24.680" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get labeled all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.030" end="00:50:27.530" style="s2">things and in fact we&#39;ve got to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.680" end="00:50:29.180" style="s2">talk about there&#39;s not much we can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.530" end="00:50:31.160" style="s2">about this nopsi thing except recognize</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.180" end="00:50:33.050" style="s2">that the term is being</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.160" end="00:50:34.940" style="s2">used so frequently in such a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.050" end="00:50:36.380" style="s2">context that it&#39;s losing its meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.940" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">frankly I&#39;m angry at everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.380" end="00:50:39.470" style="s2">doing that because if there&#39;s one term</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:40.910" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to screw up it&#39;s not see</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.470" end="00:50:42.650" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna need that one at some point</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.910" end="00:50:46.580" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to have ruined it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.650" end="00:50:49.190" style="s2">cut it out guys but as far as Socialists</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.580" end="00:50:50.780" style="s2">go we have badly misunderstood this one</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.190" end="00:50:54.650" style="s2">and you know there will be those who</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.780" end="00:50:56.770" style="s2">look at my kovat haircut and hear me</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.650" end="00:50:59.270" style="s2">saying things that aren&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.770" end="00:51:01.130" style="s2">derisive about socialism they&#39;ll think</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.270" end="00:51:02.090" style="s2">AHA we got him this time but no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:04.760" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.090" end="00:51:06.470" style="s2">okay socialism doesn&#39;t work I think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.760" end="00:51:09.740" style="s2">reason that socialism doesn&#39;t work is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.470" end="00:51:12.590" style="s2">crystal clear that does not cause me to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.740" end="00:51:15.610" style="s2">fear all socialists it causes me to fear</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.590" end="00:51:18.350" style="s2">socialists who wish to impose socialism</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.610" end="00:51:19.670" style="s2">but that&#39;s not what most socialists are</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.350" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">doing it&#39;s not what Bernie Sanders is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.670" end="00:51:24.650" style="s2">doing so anyway I don&#39;t fear socialists</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:26.900" style="s2">even though I know socialism is a dead</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.650" end="00:51:28.100" style="s2">end and often a dangerous one but we</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.900" end="00:51:29.960" style="s2">should have that conversation so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.100" end="00:51:31.490" style="s2">everybody is armed with the same model</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.960" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">or if the model is wrong somebody can</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.490" end="00:51:38.060" style="s2">tell me what&#39;s wrong with it and I can</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:42.320" style="s2">fix mine but anyway for another day okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.060" end="00:51:45.170" style="s2">Frederick Vaughn if you are wrong that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.320" end="00:51:47.600" style="s2">is not what the back stories indicate</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.170" end="00:51:50.090" style="s2">the chickens live a brave life of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.600" end="00:51:52.100" style="s2">adventure I don&#39;t know what conflict</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.090" end="00:51:54.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve walked into here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.100" end="00:51:57.950" style="s2">fascinating and chickens are central</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.650" end="00:51:59.780" style="s2">that much I can tell the generational</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.950" end="00:52:01.250" style="s2">hormone hypothesis is an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.780" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">hypothesis and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.250" end="00:52:08.150" style="s2">statistics from both the human and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:09.890" style="s2">animal populations to support it okay so</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.150" end="00:52:12.050" style="s2">somebody really wants me to check into</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.890" end="00:52:14.260" style="s2">this I guess I should check into all</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.050" end="00:52:16.570" style="s2">right you got my attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.260" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">hello Brett do you attempt to position</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.570" end="00:52:20.380" style="s2">yourself as a scholar on this program</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.270" style="s2">from an Objectivist a political</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.380" end="00:52:24.040" style="s2">standpoint in other words please talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.270" end="00:52:26.320" style="s2">about how your worldview informs your</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.040" end="00:52:28.120" style="s2">role as a scholar podcaster yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.320" end="00:52:30.220" style="s2">simple this is simple I have a rule it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.120" end="00:52:32.590" style="s2">explicit sometimes I put it on the board</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.220" end="00:52:34.060" style="s2">for students so that they can formalize</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.590" end="00:52:36.580" style="s2">it in their own minds and adopt it</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.060" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s the right one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.580" end="00:52:42.850" style="s2">like this it is natural for your</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:44.860" style="s2">scientific perspective to influence your</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.850" end="00:52:47.620" style="s2">political perspective and your ideology</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.860" end="00:52:50.560" style="s2">totally normal it is completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.620" end="00:52:53.380" style="s2">unacceptable for your political beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.560" end="00:52:55.300" style="s2">or ideology to influence your science</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.380" end="00:52:59.050" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting here on this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.300" end="00:53:00.310" style="s2">is me as I actually am right the only</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.050" end="00:53:02.860" style="s2">thing that&#39;s different on this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.310" end="00:53:04.900" style="s2">from who I actually am is that I curse</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.860" end="00:53:06.550" style="s2">more in real life and I don&#39;t do it on</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.900" end="00:53:07.840" style="s2">this podcast when I can avoid it because</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.550" end="00:53:10.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get demonetised for no</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.840" end="00:53:12.940" style="s2">reason but if we put that aside in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.840" end="00:53:15.400" style="s2">general you&#39;re getting me as I am you</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.940" end="00:53:18.670" style="s2">getting me as my students saw me and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.400" end="00:53:19.960" style="s2">point is look I&#39;m being honest with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.670" end="00:53:21.160" style="s2">about the relationship between these two</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.960" end="00:53:23.140" style="s2">things what I think is true</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.160" end="00:53:24.280" style="s2">scientifically influences what I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.140" end="00:53:26.470" style="s2">politically and I&#39;m not embarrassed</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.280" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">about that it doesn&#39;t go the other way</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.470" end="00:53:32.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s important any scientist who</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:37.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t maintain that border is suspect</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.830" end="00:53:38.920" style="s2">and so anyway you&#39;re not getting one or</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.120" end="00:53:39.970" style="s2">the other you&#39;re getting both if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.920" end="00:53:42.070" style="s2">not clear to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.970" end="00:53:44.050" style="s2">that one that&#39;s something I say is on</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.070" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">one of those channels and not the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.050" end="00:53:49.150" style="s2">you could ask but I will try to make it</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:52.360" style="s2">clear and probably should just trust</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.150" end="00:53:54.940" style="s2">your gut about which part of my my</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.360" end="00:54:00.760" style="s2">worldview you&#39;re hearing at that given</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.940" end="00:54:02.320" style="s2">moment okay let&#39;s see hello Brett do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.760" end="00:54:06.220" style="s2">attempt to visit oh that&#39;s the same one</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.320" end="00:54:08.740" style="s2">okay I think employees of prisons</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.220" end="00:54:11.620" style="s2">nursing homes and meatpacking plants get</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.740" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">little or no paid time off and they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.620" end="00:54:18.370" style="s2">paid very little is just mandating paid</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:19.890" style="s2">time off going to help a lot well look I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.370" end="00:54:22.780" style="s2">think a lot of people are underpaid and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.890" end="00:54:25.320" style="s2">to the extent that important functions</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.780" end="00:54:27.279" style="s2">like nursing homes and prisons and</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.320" end="00:54:30.939" style="s2">meatpacking plants</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.279" end="00:54:32.769" style="s2">are essentially taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.939" end="00:54:35.439" style="s2">their workers in a way that has</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.769" end="00:54:39.539" style="s2">externalized costs in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.439" end="00:54:43.509" style="s2">presumably brutality in prisons and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.539" end="00:54:46.449" style="s2">neglect in nursing homes and pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.509" end="00:54:48.599" style="s2">spreading and packing plants you know it</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.449" end="00:54:51.819" style="s2">comes back to haunt us in other forms so</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.599" end="00:54:54.059" style="s2">yeah we should we should build a system</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.819" end="00:54:56.619" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t do that we should price</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.059" end="00:54:59.319" style="s2">everything much better than we do in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.619" end="00:55:01.059" style="s2">most cases okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.319" end="00:55:03.579" style="s2">I have reached the end of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.059" end="00:55:06.479" style="s2">this has been very interesting I am</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.579" end="00:55:12.089" style="s2">looking forward to having Heather back</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.479" end="00:55:15.969" style="s2">to make the sound of my voice less</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.089" end="00:55:18.519" style="s2">dominant and to increase the richness of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.969" end="00:55:21.159" style="s2">the conversation but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.519" end="00:55:26.439" style="s2">interesting experiment all right</p>
