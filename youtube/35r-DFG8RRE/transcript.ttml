<p begin="00:00:05.470" end="00:00:12.050" style="s2">could you tell a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.469" end="00:00:18.500" style="s2">very beginnings of the new alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.050" end="00:00:22.700" style="s2">Institute oh it all started uh well it</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.500" end="00:00:25.070" style="s2">was right about the time of well 1917</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.700" end="00:00:26.630" style="s2">just before when people were just there</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.070" end="00:00:31.880" style="s2">was a new wave of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.630" end="00:00:33.829" style="s2">awareness Paul Ehrlich had published the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.880" end="00:00:35.149" style="s2">Population Bomb there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.829" end="00:00:36.710" style="s2">people beginning to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.149" end="00:00:41.420" style="s2">environment and read about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.710" end="00:00:43.940" style="s2">environment and we were living in San</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.420" end="00:00:46.070" style="s2">Diego in California and John and his</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.940" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">colleague Villa Carney and others were</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.070" end="00:00:50.329" style="s2">starting to listen to what people were</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">saying and we became concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.329" end="00:00:54.350" style="s2">thought we got to learn more so we start</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:56.059" style="s2">to hold some evening seminars in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.350" end="00:00:59.980" style="s2">living room we talked for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.059" end="00:01:03.469" style="s2">about all of us going wrong you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.980" end="00:01:06.350" style="s2">then from car exhausts in the air</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.469" end="00:01:09.500" style="s2">supposing to cause brain damage damage</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.350" end="00:01:11.450" style="s2">and children nitrate from fertilizers</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.500" end="00:01:13.940" style="s2">leaching into the ground and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.450" end="00:01:17.930" style="s2">affecting the health of children through</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.940" end="00:01:21.159" style="s2">groundwater and we got tired of just</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.930" end="00:01:22.909" style="s2">what John a bill called doom watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.159" end="00:01:25.190" style="s2">documenting everything that was going</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.909" end="00:01:30.020" style="s2">wrong and start to ask ourselves can we</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.190" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">do anything about it and I became clear</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.020" end="00:01:34.100" style="s2">to us that we didn&#39;t know whether we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:37.070" style="s2">could create change but we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.100" end="00:01:40.850" style="s2">should try so we started welcoming with</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.070" end="00:01:42.260" style="s2">the question it&#39;s impossible for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.850" end="00:01:44.470" style="s2">present human population to live</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.260" end="00:01:47.270" style="s2">sustainably on the planet without</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.470" end="00:01:51.350" style="s2">creating you know ongoing damage to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.270" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">natural systems and we found out the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.350" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">Institute and then decided to be here to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:57.560" style="s2">find out so that&#39;s why and we moved</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.670" end="00:02:02.030" style="s2">across the country to Cape Cod and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.560" end="00:02:05.290" style="s2">rented 12 acres of land and proceeded to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.030" end="00:02:07.330" style="s2">undertake really serious experiments in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.290" end="00:02:10.660" style="s2">food and energy</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.330" end="00:02:17.470" style="s2">and I&#39;m architecture looking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.660" end="00:02:20.230" style="s2">alternatives and at what stage did you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.470" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">really gain to the public recognition</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.230" end="00:02:27.310" style="s2">and tranny essentially well early on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">it probably was a not a good thing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.310" end="00:02:31.090" style="s2">the long run because we can probably got</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">the idea that anything we decided we</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.090" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">would do we could do quickly and easily</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:37.690" style="s2">people started to we had barely planted</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:40.510" style="s2">our first gardens before people started</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.690" end="00:02:42.580" style="s2">to arrive in considerable numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.510" end="00:02:45.370" style="s2">within a few years by the thousands</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.580" end="00:02:47.620" style="s2">yeah-ah every week up to 10,000 visitors</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.370" end="00:02:50.680" style="s2">um but there&#39;s a reason for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.620" end="00:02:56.620" style="s2">we were we were even though we barely</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.680" end="00:02:59.620" style="s2">had traction we were publishing a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.620" end="00:03:02.200" style="s2">creative visions and designs and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.620" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">and telling the world this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:06.940" style="s2">going to do you know and it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:09.730" style="s2">bold we said we&#39;re going to restore the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.940" end="00:03:13.570" style="s2">lands protect the Seas and informally</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.730" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s - exactly - stories and and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.570" end="00:03:19.300" style="s2">really went dead at it and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:22.330" style="s2">of the advantages we had is both bill</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.300" end="00:03:24.220" style="s2">and I were doom watch scientists so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.330" end="00:03:28.180" style="s2">could see the unraveling of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.220" end="00:03:31.780" style="s2">world through a very long telescope I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.180" end="00:03:33.730" style="s2">mean I had found that the social</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.780" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">communication signals and fishes could</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.730" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">be disrupted by agricultural chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">three and four orders of magnitude more</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:48.459" style="s2">dilute than lethal levels - in essence</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">virtually eliminate them without killing</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.459" end="00:03:53.320" style="s2">them and because the parents instead of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:56.110" style="s2">nurturing their young would eat the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.320" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">young that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.110" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">so we knew that the we had to go down at</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">this problems one thing that we did have</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:12.299" style="s2">was the broad canvas roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">but Stuart brand was putting together</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.299" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">with the Whole Earth Catalog where he</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">set out you know as Diderot did in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">France centuries earlier to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">reorganize knowledge around some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">new paradigm and the paradigm he chose</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:33.690" style="s2">was the work of the systems thinker</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:35.789" style="s2">Gregory Bateson and and and the work of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.690" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">the arch designer</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.789" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller and then he grafted</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:44.789" style="s2">on that the sort of the wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">Sensibility of people like Rachel Carson</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.789" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">that other people renting to those and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:53.970" style="s2">ready to both who were very very earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.690" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">in tune with the earth and its needs I</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.970" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">thought was it it was a it was a moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">who if you if you had to name three or</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:04.949" style="s2">four or five people who really deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">influenced your work in kind of them put</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.949" end="00:05:11.430" style="s2">you on your way who would these people</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:16.979" style="s2">be massive you start without certainly</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.430" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">Gregory Bateson certainly Stuart brand</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.979" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">William Irwin Thompson definitely</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.080" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;d put what anywhere when</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:27.110" style="s2">Thompson first Margaret Mead</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:38.650" style="s2">it&#39;s to a brand if I didn&#39;t say to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:43.449" style="s2">break yeah well for me it was catalyzed</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.650" end="00:05:45.400" style="s2">by some of the ecological writers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.449" end="00:05:48.820" style="s2">thinkers and perhaps one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.400" end="00:05:50.979" style="s2">profound was HT Odin when his in his</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.820" end="00:05:56.229" style="s2">little book energy power and society he</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.979" end="00:05:58.090" style="s2">said why don&#39;t we rethink life in such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.229" end="00:06:00.250" style="s2">way that we can create a new partnership</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.090" end="00:06:02.979" style="s2">and then he went on that make the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.250" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">outrageous statements is that life forms</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.979" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">are just simply a vast bin of spare</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:11.800" style="s2">parts for us to utilize in the creation</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:14.590" style="s2">of ecological technologies that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.800" end="00:06:17.229" style="s2">harm the earth and I like that that had</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.590" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2">a lot of had a lot of horsepower behind</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.229" end="00:06:24.099" style="s2">it but we were also driven by a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">the social the social forces including</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.099" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">you know the brothers Goodwin in</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:35.500" style="s2">communitas and and the writing itself no</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">I was talking about me and and principal</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:39.240" style="s2">potkins</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:44.289" style="s2">you know writing I had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.240" end="00:06:46.060" style="s2">fascination by that also the Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.289" end="00:06:48.760" style="s2">Needham science and civilisation in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.060" end="00:06:50.470" style="s2">China was a big influence on me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.760" end="00:06:54.820" style="s2">just all over the place I was completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.470" end="00:06:57.130" style="s2">omnivorous about about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.820" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">integrate knowledge and seeking sources</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.130" end="00:07:00.340" style="s2">for him everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:04.090" style="s2">I think Nancy&#39;s named the key players</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.340" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">and and then I&#39;ve added this sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.090" end="00:07:09.909" style="s2">the deep technological in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:12.650" style="s2">Joseph Needham in scientific logical</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.909" end="00:07:15.860" style="s2">case of Odum but there are many others</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.650" end="00:07:19.600" style="s2">including my professors as a doctoral</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.860" end="00:07:22.699" style="s2">student you yesterday you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.600" end="00:07:25.130" style="s2">Gregory Bateson referring to your work</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.699" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">as know there&#39;s an epistemology with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.130" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">future and we could you tell that story</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:33.830" style="s2">again and also which particular bit of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.880" end="00:07:36.289" style="s2">the work was he was he referring to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.830" end="00:07:39.860" style="s2">I&#39;ll get Nancy to tell you the story but</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.289" end="00:07:41.990" style="s2">basically I presented our work to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.860" end="00:07:44.449" style="s2">Lindisfarne gathering at the very early</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.990" end="00:07:47.510" style="s2">days of Linda&#39;s fire and Gregory was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.449" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">there yes and interestingly John threat</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.510" end="00:07:54.139" style="s2">directly followed after for Schumacher</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:07:56.389" style="s2">so as one of our colleagues said John</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.139" end="00:08:01.190" style="s2">set out like a golf ball on a tee</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.389" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">because Schumacher had a lot of the was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.190" end="00:08:05.990" style="s2">it Burma that he did a lot of his work</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:08.510" style="s2">he had a lot of examples from elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.990" end="00:08:10.699" style="s2">but then John came on with slides at</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.510" end="00:08:12.949" style="s2">that time not a PowerPoint and had</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.699" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">slides of everybody doing exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.949" end="00:08:17.510" style="s2">at no alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">exactly what Fritz had said people</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.510" end="00:08:24.020" style="s2">should do and so there we were you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:26.120" style="s2">creating small healthy local economies</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.020" end="00:08:27.889" style="s2">growing our own food looking for</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.120" end="00:08:31.159" style="s2">alternative renewable energy sources</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.889" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">building windmills and obviously having</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.159" end="00:08:39.500" style="s2">a good time and so when John finished</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">Gregory who&#39;s a great bear of a fellow</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.500" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">kind of turned it well now there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.669" end="00:08:48.680" style="s2">epistemology with a future we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:51.500" style="s2">mighty pleased yes so that was it that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.680" end="00:08:54.500" style="s2">was that felt us if we&#39;d ever had any</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.500" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">self doubt which he really didn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.500" end="00:08:58.490" style="s2">would have erased it that was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:01.160" style="s2">wonderful well the reason why would not</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.490" end="00:09:03.620" style="s2">have a ton of self-doubt is that our</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.160" end="00:09:06.650" style="s2">work was really very romantic in the in</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.620" end="00:09:09.080" style="s2">the in the aesthetic and cultural sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.650" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">you know we were you know sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.080" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">Gary Snyder&#39;s to be truly alive is to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">a transforming energies yeah yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">for a tremendous fun it&#39;s also stressful</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">but fun where did the tone</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:29.240" style="s2">near Hulka me their eyes and could you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.050" style="s2">say a little bit more about why you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.240" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">chose her</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.050" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">the it shows us it shows us yes it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:39.380" style="s2">really did we&#39;ve been over anything all</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:41.900" style="s2">kinds of things you know Oh sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.380" end="00:09:44.510" style="s2">this and really quite boring non</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.900" end="00:09:47.030" style="s2">memorable names and then one night time</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.510" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">remember so clearly John stuck his head</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.030" end="00:09:50.630" style="s2">around the kitchen door we hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:52.070" style="s2">talking about anything it&#39;s not his head</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.630" end="00:09:55.550" style="s2">around the kitchen door and said new</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.070" end="00:09:58.520" style="s2">alchemy and I said yes it was just so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.550" end="00:10:03.380" style="s2">clear so was this idea yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.520" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">worked and I it I know where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.380" end="00:10:08.780" style="s2">Wellsprings came from it because our</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:12.890" style="s2">knowledge of alchemy came later I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.780" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">looking at an arts Canada art magazine</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.890" end="00:10:22.820" style="s2">and there were these little paintings on</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:25.550" style="s2">stones that had been placed in I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.820" end="00:10:30.700" style="s2">Vancouver Island and there was a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.550" end="00:10:33.890" style="s2">caption saying modern day alchemy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.700" end="00:10:38.810" style="s2">then months later this popped out of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.890" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">mouth and and it was maybe the two of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.810" end="00:10:44.900" style="s2">you and Velma clammy who was daunted yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:53.900" style="s2">he also moved over from from California</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.900" end="00:10:56.950" style="s2">to Reddington to Cape Cod yes and oh he</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.900" end="00:11:00.260" style="s2">stayed for many many years well into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.950" end="00:11:06.650" style="s2">80s yeah and he stayed as long as we did</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.260" end="00:11:08.870" style="s2">what see his work in Costa Rica was new</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.650" end="00:11:13.250" style="s2">alchemy in Costa Rica yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.870" end="00:11:14.870" style="s2">called and I is still see a cylinder you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.250" end="00:11:20.990" style="s2">could probably say new alchemy bed and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.870" end="00:11:23.210" style="s2">weekend yeah yeah and and if he liked it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.990" end="00:11:27.700" style="s2">because serendipitously it also means</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.210" end="00:11:31.520" style="s2">hope in the bri-bri native language so</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.700" end="00:11:32.680" style="s2">so he he always saw himself as an</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.520" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">extension of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:42.270" style="s2">work oh yeah in in in Costa Rica and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:44.710" style="s2">supplied him with lots of in terms and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.270" end="00:11:46.690" style="s2">talent that were nurtured here and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.710" end="00:11:49.270" style="s2">went to help him there or spent you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.690" end="00:11:51.700" style="s2">went for yeah that&#39;s a semester solo</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.270" end="00:11:54.670" style="s2">spent on there it&#39;s a hugely successful</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.700" end="00:11:56.080" style="s2">protective hugely successful what ifs of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.670" end="00:11:58.500" style="s2">the way and see such as at one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.080" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">best months for development period a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.500" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">tremendous amount of and the project on</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:10.660" style="s2">Prince Edward Island also gave you a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:16.029" style="s2">of publicity how did that start it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.660" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">the UN year of habitat</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.029" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">Barbara Ward had announced some new</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">vision of human settlements at a UN</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">meeting in Vancouver British Columbia</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">and so the Canadian government was open</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">to new ideas for a short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">and so I approached Environment Canada</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:43.720" style="s2">and after series and meetings proposals</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:47.589" style="s2">the idea of an ark Prince Edward Island</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.720" end="00:12:50.650" style="s2">was finally approved and and funded and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.589" end="00:12:55.089" style="s2">we started the designing and the track</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.650" end="00:12:57.640" style="s2">and then most of us came from New</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.089" end="00:12:59.709" style="s2">England to Prince Edward Island and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.640" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">of a group that worked on it the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.709" end="00:13:04.600" style="s2">majority stayed there to live the rest</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:08.470" style="s2">of their lives and continued the work so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.600" end="00:13:12.370" style="s2">it was a it was a relatively short live</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.470" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">project probably no more than five years</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.370" end="00:13:18.610" style="s2">but it incubated a whole new generation</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">of people in Canada they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.610" end="00:13:25.750" style="s2">remarkable work could you describe the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:31.380" style="s2">ideals to buy a shelter a little buy the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.750" end="00:13:36.490" style="s2">shelter is really the home for life</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.380" end="00:13:38.860" style="s2">diverse life if you were to envision a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.490" end="00:13:40.420" style="s2">green house that was ecologically</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.860" end="00:13:42.459" style="s2">designed in the sense that it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.420" end="00:13:44.350" style="s2">protected from the north and open to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.459" end="00:13:47.410" style="s2">south and received a lot of solar energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.350" end="00:13:49.990" style="s2">but then your standard green house has</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.410" end="00:13:52.540" style="s2">to use rather chemical management just</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.990" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">you know pesticides and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.540" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">thing we never there were never any soap</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:14:00.490" style="s2">it was a place to grow food and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:03.970" style="s2">when we added ah in terms of vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.490" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">fruits and also raised fish and very</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.970" end="00:14:08.860" style="s2">very a wonderfully fertile environment</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">that just cry mean we could ripen</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.860" end="00:14:14.400" style="s2">tomatoes without any fossil fuel heat in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">February in a well designed mean house</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.400" end="00:14:20.199" style="s2">but the one in Prince Edward Island had</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.540" style="s2">the added dimension is also a health sir</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.199" end="00:14:24.400" style="s2">home so the with living quarters so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.540" end="00:14:27.070" style="s2">is a whole new dimension of how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.400" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">supply sufficient energy from the wind</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.070" end="00:14:31.630" style="s2">and the Sun to not only provide a void</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:33.880" style="s2">space in a growing space but living</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.630" end="00:14:37.390" style="s2">space it also had research space with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.880" end="00:14:39.970" style="s2">offices and computers and things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.390" end="00:14:44.199" style="s2">that so it served a number of functions</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.970" end="00:14:48.430" style="s2">I think the breakthrough with the bio</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.199" end="00:14:52.570" style="s2">shelters was the proof that one could</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.430" end="00:14:55.089" style="s2">take agricultural ecosystems and move</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.570" end="00:14:57.760" style="s2">them indoors and allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.089" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">self-regulate in self design and protect</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.760" end="00:15:04.779" style="s2">themselves from disease and pests and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">we assembled the ecology and it really</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.779" end="00:15:11.800" style="s2">was a very collective effort no single</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:14.770" style="s2">person knew exactly how to do it there</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.800" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">would be people working with IPM</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.770" end="00:15:19.150" style="s2">integrated pest management other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:22.510" style="s2">working with companion planting other</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.150" end="00:15:25.180" style="s2">people working with one of my special</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.510" end="00:15:28.660" style="s2">contributions was the creation of little</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.180" end="00:15:29.940" style="s2">ecological islands what we call just</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.660" end="00:15:34.830" style="s2">call refugia</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.940" end="00:15:36.930" style="s2">we&#39;re beneficial organisms would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.830" end="00:15:39.240" style="s2">present in the system but not the kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.930" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">of beneficial organisms that most</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.240" end="00:15:43.770" style="s2">horticulturist think of they were things</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:46.410" style="s2">like creatures like dragonflies and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:48.870" style="s2">damselflies that live in water so there</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.410" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">would be little pools amongst the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.870" end="00:15:54.470" style="s2">so that was my personal contribution and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:57.930" style="s2">then there were others who looked at at</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.470" end="00:16:00.660" style="s2">which kind of flowers had to be mixed</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.930" end="00:16:03.690" style="s2">with the crops in order that the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.660" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">predatory insects would have a feet</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.690" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">source to feed on pests in other words</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:15.030" style="s2">it was a really a superb example of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:17.310" style="s2">different kinds of intelligence working</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.030" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">in a given space to create a whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.310" end="00:16:21.510" style="s2">system until the natural intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:23.310" style="s2">including natural intelligence but what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.510" end="00:16:25.170" style="s2">is important I think that Jonathan made</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.310" end="00:16:29.850" style="s2">the point that it was there well now</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:31.860" style="s2">21st equivalent of a barn where you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.850" end="00:16:34.440" style="s2">things were stored together out the cold</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.860" end="00:16:36.630" style="s2">season and now with peak oil approaching</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.440" end="00:16:38.430" style="s2">and climate change too could possibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.630" end="00:16:40.830" style="s2">I think it&#39;s even more important because</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.430" end="00:16:43.140" style="s2">people are going to need to produce much</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.830" end="00:16:45.450" style="s2">more food locally and regionally and</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.140" end="00:16:48.210" style="s2">this is a way of continuing to grow for</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.450" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">instance in an urban context you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.210" end="00:16:52.650" style="s2">have one every few blocks or in every</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:55.170" style="s2">neighborhood where people could have</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.650" end="00:16:57.240" style="s2">year-round community gardens so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.170" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">have application I think even more now</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.240" end="00:17:01.860" style="s2">and so much of what we were doing years</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:06.900" style="s2">ago that&#39;s experimental is now becoming</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:11.040" style="s2">a necessity so um the the time is caught</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">up with us and the early aquaculture</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.040" end="00:17:16.890" style="s2">experiments with Makani and you growing</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.949" style="s2">fish in these large large mats</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.890" end="00:17:21.900" style="s2">eventually turned into productive living</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.949" end="00:17:24.420" style="s2">machines and then at some point you also</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.900" end="00:17:27.930" style="s2">decided to see if if these could be used</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.420" end="00:17:34.310" style="s2">to clean up water could you just how</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.930" end="00:17:37.310" style="s2">this kind of takes figure that will we</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.310" end="00:17:37.310" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.470" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">honored sunlight is a as a primary</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.620" end="00:17:48.090" style="s2">organizing principle we created tanks</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:50.220" style="s2">that had clear side so that in in three</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.090" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">dimensions sunlight can penetrate them</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.220" end="00:17:57.330" style="s2">and and then we built ecosystems with</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:01.550" style="s2">missions they built we assemble</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.330" end="00:18:05.790" style="s2">ecosystems within them and then began to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.550" end="00:18:10.800" style="s2">create food chains that would produce</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.790" end="00:18:13.410" style="s2">fish and as a byproduct of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.800" end="00:18:17.510" style="s2">filtration of fish water also vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.410" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">and and greens and things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.510" end="00:18:25.140" style="s2">again here is this process of of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:28.050" style="s2">capturing sunlight designing food webs</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.140" end="00:18:31.260" style="s2">of trying to incorporate many of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.050" end="00:18:36.090" style="s2">different kingdoms of life into a single</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.260" end="00:18:41.010" style="s2">space so that they could integrate led</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.090" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">to first some theories about ecological</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.010" end="00:18:47.370" style="s2">design which got published but a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">later and and then move from food</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.370" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">production out into worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">problems of pollution and waste and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:19:02.010" style="s2">toxic environments and that led to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:04.560" style="s2">another level of of attempting to work</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.010" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">in an even more complex way with natural</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.560" end="00:19:11.040" style="s2">systems and spent probably a decade</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:14.780" style="s2">trying to figure out how to work with</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.040" end="00:19:17.480" style="s2">toxic waste and sewage and septage and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.780" end="00:19:21.930" style="s2">industrial waste and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.480" end="00:19:27.690" style="s2">eventually the the pieces began to fall</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.930" end="00:19:33.390" style="s2">together so that by by getting on toward</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.690" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">the middle of the 1990s the theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.390" end="00:19:40.500" style="s2">foundations for it had been laid out and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:43.940" style="s2">then after that period we then began to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.500" end="00:19:47.420" style="s2">look at how we can reassemble that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.940" end="00:19:48.550" style="s2">knowledge again and create what we call</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.420" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.550" end="00:19:54.180" style="s2">Etha parks so that you bring different</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:57.670" style="s2">disparate activities together like</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.180" end="00:20:01.680" style="s2">baking and brewing and sauce making and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.670" end="00:20:06.040" style="s2">restaurants and you combine those with</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:08.650" style="s2">with new product development including</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.040" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">agricultural products and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.650" end="00:20:14.860" style="s2">continuum that began I would say with</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">some of McLaren East ponds and his</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.860" end="00:20:24.550" style="s2">basement to the first solar ponds that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:29.940" style="s2">created here all the way to where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.550" end="00:20:35.260" style="s2">at now which is more years later than</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.940" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">over 30 years and so now we&#39;re beginning</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.260" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">to think about even transforming</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.000" end="00:20:48.660" style="s2">existing processes like sewage treatment</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">plants into sewage farms that will grow</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.660" end="00:20:56.140" style="s2">higher plants botanicals that will</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">provide us with the biodiesel energy we</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.140" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">need in the future in other words why</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:03.810" style="s2">throw away all the energy and nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.550" style="s2">that&#39;s in human waste</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.810" end="00:21:11.080" style="s2">why not redirect it into a pathway</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.550" end="00:21:14.110" style="s2">that&#39;s applicable to a a era of possibly</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.080" end="00:21:20.340" style="s2">scarce and scarce scarcities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.110" end="00:21:23.260" style="s2">disruptions so there&#39;s a I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.340" end="00:21:28.210" style="s2">it&#39;s I can see a continuum and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.260" end="00:21:30.190" style="s2">never really written about it from my</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.210" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">first experiments at the Woods Hole</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.190" end="00:21:36.520" style="s2">Oceanographic Institution where I tried</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:38.830" style="s2">to create simulated tropical marine</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.520" end="00:21:44.830" style="s2">environments in a greenhouse on Cape Cod</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.830" end="00:21:49.960" style="s2">and began to develop for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.830" end="00:21:53.260" style="s2">a science of ecological assembly in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.960" end="00:21:55.090" style="s2">other words where I took pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.260" end="00:21:58.390" style="s2">elements from the edge of the sea and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.090" end="00:22:01.500" style="s2">put them in a greenhouse that I then was</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.390" end="00:22:05.159" style="s2">able to create hold and fire</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.500" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">that allowed tropical fishes that I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.159" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">studying to actually breed in those</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:12.030" style="s2">buildings and breeding marine fishes</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:15.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy and it was just so</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.030" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">exciting to see this kind of assembly</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:22.289" style="s2">and of course again all these influences</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:26.280" style="s2">that were coming in at this time and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.289" end="00:22:30.470" style="s2">still are I was very impressed with levy</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">Strauss&#39;s book the raw and the cook and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.470" end="00:22:34.950" style="s2">the idea of the brechler</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:38.190" style="s2">you know the enlightened tinkerer who</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.950" end="00:22:40.710" style="s2">finds you know whatever it is around he</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.190" end="00:22:43.559" style="s2">or she and to to create something</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.710" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">marvelous out of what most people would</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.559" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">see is junk and I thought that the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">kind of thinking could be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:55.080" style="s2">living forms ecological elements this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:56.700" style="s2">for you to the birth of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.080" end="00:23:00.929" style="s2">design and how would you define Inca</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.700" end="00:23:05.880" style="s2">logical design for me it was and I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.929" end="00:23:11.669" style="s2">slow to realize what I was doing but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.880" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">I had a sense of where I was headed well</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.669" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned ecological</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:20.490" style="s2">design is tapping into nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:24.120" style="s2">operating instructions and applying what</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.490" end="00:23:28.020" style="s2">it knows and how it does things and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.120" end="00:23:29.909" style="s2">what ways it accomplishes its ends which</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.020" end="00:23:33.030" style="s2">are so much more efficient than anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.909" end="00:23:35.789" style="s2">we can engineer on our own and also less</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.030" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">destructive and then direct it and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.789" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">is the design part directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">solving a human need whether its food or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">fuels or environmental repair or waste</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">conversion or energy so are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:58.790" style="s2">combined and you were both involved in</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.640" end="00:24:00.860" style="s2">the adam joseph lewis and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.790" end="00:24:04.820" style="s2">cool collaborative design were you not</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.860" end="00:24:08.030" style="s2">just drunk yester in the collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.820" end="00:24:10.100" style="s2">design process that created the building</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.030" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">could you say a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.100" end="00:24:17.450" style="s2">process well I was I was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:21.740" style="s2">present but I was a very minor actor on</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.450" end="00:24:25.310" style="s2">the very exciting stage well though the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.740" end="00:24:27.650" style="s2">new alchemy ideas certainly worthy you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.310" end="00:24:30.590" style="s2">know yeah the original model that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.650" end="00:24:32.990" style="s2">big battle shelter melee or arc and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.590" end="00:24:35.660" style="s2">both went and spoken Overland and showed</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.990" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">a lot of flights yes so that into that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.660" end="00:24:46.490" style="s2">degree it expands to students yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.120" end="00:24:50.260" style="s2">exactly and and and basically the David</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.490" end="00:24:55.850" style="s2">or who is the impresario professor who</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.260" end="00:24:59.140" style="s2">was the conductor of it all made some</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.850" end="00:25:01.970" style="s2">very early on decisions which I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.140" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">made the project more exciting for some</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.970" end="00:25:08.870" style="s2">of us at least and that was he intended</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:12.110" style="s2">to include his students and the staff</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.870" end="00:25:17.450" style="s2">and the faculty in the design so it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.110" end="00:25:20.120" style="s2">a process that was not driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.450" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">experts you know the grand architect or</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.120" end="00:25:26.120" style="s2">the brilliant engineer or the you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:30.110" style="s2">the wicked ecological designer was all</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.120" end="00:25:35.690" style="s2">done in a process and it was fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.110" end="00:25:38.210" style="s2">to watch normally experts who are used</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.690" end="00:25:39.770" style="s2">to telling people how to do things to</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:59.230" style="s2">coming into the process and I think</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.230" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">understood that collective design and</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:10.100" style="s2">and I must say I&#39;ve learned a lot about</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.160" end="00:26:47.380" style="s2">looked at it in three ways first is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:55.030" style="s2">idea of retrofitting badly designed</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.380" end="00:27:01.040" style="s2">older buildings into very green</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.600" end="00:27:19.670" style="s2">I can see I could see what it would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.050" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">like to walk through a ten years from</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.670" end="00:27:25.670" style="s2">now I could I got I have it all on my</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.220" end="00:27:37.810" style="s2">that I would really like to see is if</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">the university is bold enough to go from</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.560" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">would also transform how universities</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.760" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">with their own dimensions and rarely</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.429" end="00:28:30.990" style="s2">cross the boundaries it&#39;s also very</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.730" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">beginning to penetrate the university</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.299" end="00:28:42.360" style="s2">system I think Yale now has one of its</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.090" end="00:29:03.299" style="s2">corporations are starting to pay</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.309" end="00:29:09.090" style="s2">as well and it&#39;s beginning to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.410" end="00:29:12.150" style="s2">that too for the University of Vermont</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.090" end="00:29:14.990" style="s2">seeing local food and Vermont is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.150" end="00:29:18.980" style="s2">amazingly good at it and available</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.990" end="00:29:22.590" style="s2">that&#39;s you&#39;ve been a writer an editor</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">the last 35 years and he started off</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:32.940" style="s2">and then annals of Earth and you&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.929" end="00:29:34.650" style="s2">written a number of books together you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.940" end="00:29:36.929" style="s2">recently published a book could you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.650" end="00:29:41.250" style="s2">could you say a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.929" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">career as a writer Ennis well first of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.250" end="00:29:46.830" style="s2">all impractically or practically it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">something I could do at home when my</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.830" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">children were small and I wanted not to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">be away all the time when my kids were</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.970" style="s2">little and secondly I&#39;m not a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.890" style="s2">so I really would didn&#39;t feel qualified</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.970" end="00:30:01.320" style="s2">to do a lot of the work that was being</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.890" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">done both at Ocean arcs and at new</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.320" end="00:30:06.950" style="s2">alchemy but I could write about it and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">figured by my writing about it I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.950" end="00:30:11.610" style="s2">explain it in a way to people who also</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.100" style="s2">weren&#39;t familiar with the science</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.610" end="00:30:15.900" style="s2">because I wasn&#39;t you know how any</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.100" end="00:30:18.360" style="s2">established group has its own sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.900" end="00:30:19.980" style="s2">language and way of communicating among</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.360" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">the members well seeing that really</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.980" end="00:30:26.040" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a member of the scientific core I</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:28.400" style="s2">could see the importance of what we were</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.040" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">doing and then try and make that</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.400" end="00:30:35.710" style="s2">relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:39.070" style="s2">a real leader who would be more in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.710" end="00:30:40.750" style="s2">state of not really understanding I had</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:42.940" style="s2">to struggle to learn to understand about</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.750" end="00:30:44.860" style="s2">ecology and the interconnectedness of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.940" end="00:30:46.600" style="s2">everything and what didn&#39;t grow up</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.860" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">wasn&#39;t educated with those common</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.600" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">concepts at all but now they seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:55.809" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious is breathing can you say</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:57.669" style="s2">but what about how you put the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.809" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">journalist in the alchemists together</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.669" end="00:31:05.710" style="s2">and what tremendous plan first started</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:07.330" style="s2">well what we did was um basically look</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.710" end="00:31:09.130" style="s2">at everything that was going on at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.330" end="00:31:13.000" style="s2">Institute in your range from gardening</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.130" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">composting tree planting fish raising of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.000" end="00:31:18.610" style="s2">course and many many different methods</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:22.809" style="s2">of it uh and administration and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.610" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">people&#39;s other interests such as bill</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.809" end="00:31:28.570" style="s2">McCartney and and Costa Rica and ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:31.870" style="s2">everybody to make a contribution but</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.570" end="00:31:33.580" style="s2">then if you just didn&#39;t both edit it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.870" end="00:31:35.890" style="s2">organize it in a certain way it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.580" end="00:31:39.780" style="s2">came out as a bunch of stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.890" end="00:31:43.059" style="s2">and there&#39;s so what I had to do was</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.780" end="00:31:46.330" style="s2">organize it into sections and then after</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.059" end="00:31:49.539" style="s2">that introduced the journal as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.330" end="00:31:51.370" style="s2">and then introduced each article so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.539" end="00:31:54.100" style="s2">people would see how they fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.370" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">whole and why this particular work was</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.100" end="00:32:01.539" style="s2">even though they kept consisted of using</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:04.299" style="s2">pond water to water vegetables to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.539" end="00:32:07.809" style="s2">how that fit into the whole picture and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.299" end="00:32:09.429" style="s2">you recent book oh it&#39;s called safe and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.809" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">sustainable world the promise of</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.110" end="00:32:18.039" style="s2">have been that without to us but they</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:20.230" style="s2">assured me that you have such a short</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.039" end="00:32:22.299" style="s2">time to catch this the attention of</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.799" end="00:32:40.660" style="s2">was experimental and useful and</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.970" end="00:35:13.720" style="s2">well on its way and I think if you look</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.690" end="00:35:47.080" style="s2">and don&#39;t foresee making major changes</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.580" end="00:35:49.570" style="s2">or adjustments I really do believe that</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:47.330" style="s2">with ingenuity beginning to pop up</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.550" end="00:36:50.990" style="s2">everywhere and it really is a horse race</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.990" end="00:36:58.980" style="s2">crash there have been people saying that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.460" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a whole economic system</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.980" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">based on growth forever the planet can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:23.070" style="s2">as to how the future is gonna turn out I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.870" end="00:37:28.070" style="s2">think what I tell students which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.070" end="00:37:31.070" style="s2">which who our most important asset that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.070" end="00:37:31.070" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.220" end="00:37:40.180" style="s2">that they need to live as if they can</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:44.180" style="s2">make a difference in the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.180" end="00:37:47.660" style="s2">because anything less than that would</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.180" end="00:37:51.260" style="s2">lead to despair and failure of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.660" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">human this human enterprise whatever one</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.260" end="00:38:02.470" style="s2">calls it so on Mondays I&#39;m optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:05.030" style="s2">gun to cease I&#39;m a pessimist em</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.030" end="00:38:09.829" style="s2">Thursday&#39;s and back being an optimist</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.069" end="00:38:12.790" style="s2">again I&#39;m a veritable roller coaster in</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.829" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">this department do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.790" end="00:38:18.950" style="s2">plan Journal of ecological design could</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:22.099" style="s2">have a role in communicating a hopeful</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.099" end="00:38:32.420" style="s2">transition is already happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.720" end="00:38:38.119" style="s2">and I think the publication ecological</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.420" end="00:38:40.730" style="s2">design if it formulates a to use Gregory</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.119" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">Bateson&#39;s phrase and epistemology with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.730" end="00:38:50.060" style="s2">future and conveys it in enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:52.609" style="s2">different ways then I think it could</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.060" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">have enormous influence I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.609" end="00:39:04.450" style="s2">essential yeah I think it&#39;s essential if</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:39:06.760" style="s2">it if it merely sets out to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.450" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">solely professionals and not</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.760" end="00:39:12.670" style="s2">decision-makers and not people from</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.670" end="00:39:20.780" style="s2">civic sectors it won&#39;t do it but if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.150" end="00:39:24.140" style="s2">somehow the the the ecological design</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.780" end="00:39:25.550" style="s2">publications and I said that the pearl</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.140" end="00:39:29.030" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.550" end="00:39:30.470" style="s2">way to communicate and you also agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.030" end="00:39:32.780" style="s2">because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.470" end="00:39:40.020" style="s2">camera here right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.780" end="00:39:42.900" style="s2">the it has an enormous possibilities for</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.020" end="00:39:46.770" style="s2">and I like the idea that it it will be</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.900" end="00:39:49.170" style="s2">multilingual even if only initially its</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.770" end="00:39:55.250" style="s2">summaries but to to have a publication</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.170" end="00:39:58.920" style="s2">in in you know Spanish French English</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.250" end="00:40:03.570" style="s2">Mandarin it&#39;s kind of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.920" end="00:40:07.400" style="s2">interesting maybe Swahili you know could</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.570" end="00:40:10.820" style="s2">be quite could be quite a force for good</p>
