<p begin="00:00:08.120" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">about the selfish ledger the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:16.830" style="s2">that as we live our lives Google</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:20.490" style="s2">collects information on us and then they</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.830" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">can tailor our decisions for what Google</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">knowing everything they know about them</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">gonna have to do it in the secret</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to do it or they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">to like in the backend create a scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">and for and trick you into by unit so</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.380" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">group saying well we need to wait for</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2">this for this thing one we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">people say well I&#39;m not comfortable</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">is it you need to feel safe to feel okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:54.450" style="s2">and then giving that to the person so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">that we get all of the data that all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.450" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">the people that are like them won&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">unless those parameters are in place so</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.989" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">the selfish ledger is because it the</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">ledger is it&#39;s somewhat based on The</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.370" end="00:03:18.630" style="s2">Selfish Gene theory and Lamarque and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:21.030" style="s2">genetics and even like Dawkins work on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.630" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">the Selfish Gene even when I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.030" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">an undergrad it was like I love like</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">this concept like as a concept not an</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.530" end="00:03:30.540" style="s2">actual fact because genes work on every</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">level or sorry evolution works on every</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.540" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">level it works on the gene level it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">works on the population level you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">be the most selfish gene in the world if</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not able to propagate your</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:43.320" style="s2">species you&#39;ve got no one to breed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">and no no way to and so the selfless</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.320" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">ledger the one that is the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">giving this data is for my benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:54.140" style="s2">the benefit of the greater good and if</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">weight I can see it my doctor can see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.850" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">if I want to share that information and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">always have the user be in control and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:18.060" style="s2">having the conversations about what can</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">this be used for that it&#39;s the greater</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:24.419" style="s2">right now I get to decide this not</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.710" end="00:04:27.650" style="s2">Google gets to decide it in a board</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.419" end="00:04:31.319" style="s2">and then implement crazy ridiculous AI</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.650" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">that make that course is us and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.319" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">follow in a path they&#39;ve somehow set out</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">and decided is the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">instead of like what do you need and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.229" end="00:04:41.460" style="s2">can we get it to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">and what do we need and can we get it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.460" end="00:04:44.490" style="s2">from you and those things hopefully are</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:45.719" style="s2">tied together well if you give us your</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.490" end="00:04:48.659" style="s2">weight I&#39;ll give you this</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.719" end="00:04:50.789" style="s2">we need your weight why well whatever</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.789" end="00:04:54.599" style="s2">decided we needed it and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.710" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">more likely to give it but nobody has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.599" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">give it Oh Google we have to start our</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:03.539" style="s2">own technology cooperatives we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:05.639" style="s2">be able to take back our power or</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.539" end="00:05:08.129" style="s2">they&#39;re just going to keep being more</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.639" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">powerful and more evil and they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.129" end="00:05:12.689" style="s2">always going to make decisions with the</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">in it and we can create these things way</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">more powerfully than they can and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:26.129" style="s2">will not be able to compete with us so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:30.319" style="s2">come join together Tech have actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.129" end="00:05:35.389" style="s2">created the devices and these systems of</p>
