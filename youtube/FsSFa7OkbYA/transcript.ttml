<p begin="00:00:07.719" end="00:00:14.780" style="s2">okay I hope that was not actively</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.669" end="00:00:17.990" style="s2">harmful for anyone so I appreciated this</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.780" end="00:00:21.140" style="s2">opportunity to sort of invite you into</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.990" end="00:00:26.050" style="s2">an inquiry that I&#39;ve been engaging in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.140" end="00:00:31.090" style="s2">own practice which is around stories and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.050" end="00:00:31.090" style="s2">the nature of stories and how stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.160" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">occupy our lives we are occupied by</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.690" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">stories and stories occupy us and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:49.190" style="s2">they&#39;re just really fascinating there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:50.839" style="s2">a wonderful quote by Muriel Luke I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.190" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">around if I&#39;m pronouncing your last name</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.839" end="00:00:57.679" style="s2">right but says that the world is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:59.659" style="s2">made of atoms but stories and to which</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.679" end="00:01:02.329" style="s2">you might say well actually the world is</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.659" end="00:01:05.390" style="s2">made of atoms but that&#39;s just one of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.329" end="00:01:09.100" style="s2">favorite stories about how the world is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.390" end="00:01:15.189" style="s2">made and so it&#39;s this really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.100" end="00:01:17.719" style="s2">way to sort of look at the world to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.189" end="00:01:24.259" style="s2">evaluate the way that we move in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.719" end="00:01:26.930" style="s2">world and so I thought first I&#39;d kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.259" end="00:01:32.899" style="s2">talk about my story in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.930" end="00:01:38.539" style="s2">stories so for as far back as I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.899" end="00:01:40.670" style="s2">remember I was so just to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.539" end="00:01:44.210" style="s2">little bit of even more background both</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.670" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">of my parents are professors both of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.210" end="00:01:49.939" style="s2">sisters my only other two siblings are</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:52.009" style="s2">also professors so you know stories we</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.939" end="00:01:54.759" style="s2">didn&#39;t call them that played a big role</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.009" end="00:01:57.109" style="s2">at you know the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.759" end="00:02:01.429" style="s2">intellectual discourse trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.109" end="00:02:03.530" style="s2">sense of the world be it politics or you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.429" end="00:02:06.350" style="s2">know philosophy or whatever it was all</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.530" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">about whether or not you could clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.350" end="00:02:11.540" style="s2">explain what was going on in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:14.069" style="s2">others could understand could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.540" end="00:02:17.310" style="s2">communicate meaning right</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.069" end="00:02:21.569" style="s2">and so for as far back as I can remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:24.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking for a story that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.569" end="00:02:28.139" style="s2">give me security that would give me</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.620" end="00:02:33.329" style="s2">meaning that made sense that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.139" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">explain why I was so unhappy right or</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.329" end="00:02:41.969" style="s2">why the world seems so insane and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">would you know go on the internet and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.969" end="00:02:48.629" style="s2">would go to Wikipedia and I would find a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:50.069" style="s2">philosophy or a political theory and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.629" end="00:02:52.909" style="s2">would get really into it and I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.069" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">think oh great okay finally you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.909" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">this is it this is like you know Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">or con sheehan philosophy or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:07.560" style="s2">is finally I found something that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:10.409" style="s2">really give me security and I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">imbibe that I would consume that as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.409" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">heard in the talk and eventually I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:17.939" style="s2">come to the bottom of it and I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:20.759" style="s2">feel actually no this does not give me</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.939" end="00:03:21.659" style="s2">security this isn&#39;t enough this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.759" end="00:03:23.849" style="s2">what I was looking for and I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.659" end="00:03:26.819" style="s2">discard it now would go back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.849" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">Wikipedia and look for a new story right</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.819" end="00:03:34.829" style="s2">and that went on for a while there are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">lot of stories out there you may have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.829" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">noticed there are a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">stories they&#39;re competing stories there</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">are people that really believe their</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">stories are that one story that one true</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">story and they&#39;re willing to defend the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:53.040" style="s2">truth the veracity of that story to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">death because for some reason that will</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.040" end="00:03:59.909" style="s2">prove that that story is true and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:04.109" style="s2">found Buddhism in meditation and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.909" end="00:04:11.239" style="s2">thought okay you know I&#39;ll try this</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.109" end="00:04:15.509" style="s2">story see where it takes me and a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.239" end="00:04:17.909" style="s2">fascinating thing began to happen as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.509" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">sort of engaged with the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.909" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">Dharma of Buddhism in that the more that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:29.610" style="s2">I practice the more that I did what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">the story told me to do which was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.610" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">sit down and be silent and like painful</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:42.509" style="s2">though it was observe my experience the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">less I felt compelled by the stories of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.509" end="00:04:50.969" style="s2">my life the less I believed that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">could offer me any real security any</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.969" end="00:05:01.139" style="s2">real happiness and so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:03.689" style="s2">and then eventually the the story of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.139" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">Buddhism began to began to self-destruct</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.689" end="00:05:10.289" style="s2">like there&#39;s some almost internal</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:14.509" style="s2">self-destruct mechanism within that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.289" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">story itself and then it&#39;s like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.509" end="00:05:20.159" style="s2">okay I mean I kind of prescribed to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:22.710" style="s2">story it was really doing well I really</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.159" end="00:05:24.180" style="s2">thought this was the one I thought this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.710" end="00:05:26.339" style="s2">was the story that was really going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.180" end="00:05:30.469" style="s2">get me there and now it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.339" end="00:05:33.960" style="s2">even that story seems to have no ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.469" end="00:05:37.430" style="s2">and so that&#39;s kind of where I&#39;m at as</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.960" end="00:05:40.020" style="s2">far as you know my story of stories and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.430" end="00:05:41.969" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping to leave a lot of time for us</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.020" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">to share our stories about the story</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.969" end="00:05:46.860" style="s2">that I&#39;m telling you so you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:49.110" style="s2">there are whatever 50 stories that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.860" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">happening here about this story that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.110" end="00:05:54.419" style="s2">telling you but just wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:59.699" style="s2">some other kind of reflections on</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.419" end="00:06:01.469" style="s2">stories so you know we are swimming in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.699" end="00:06:04.710" style="s2">stories and we might not we might think</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.469" end="00:06:06.839" style="s2">okay stories are like you know creation</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.710" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">myths and folktales but it&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.839" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">more than that right it&#39;s like newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">store newspaper articles and blogs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">how-to manuals and Facebook status</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:20.879" style="s2">updates you know stories that we share</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">with everybody even if nobody actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.879" end="00:06:27.870" style="s2">cares like these stories that fill our</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:32.789" style="s2">lives that communicate meaning that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.870" end="00:06:36.509" style="s2">assert our identity through and in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.789" end="00:06:38.459" style="s2">of ways a story is nothing more than you</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.509" end="00:06:40.900" style="s2">might say like an account of something</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.459" end="00:06:44.650" style="s2">right like what are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.900" end="00:06:49.600" style="s2">these unpaid bills here tell me about</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.650" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">that or why is there something rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.600" end="00:06:58.270" style="s2">than nothing tell me a story about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:07:00.460" style="s2">or where do babies come from tell me a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.270" end="00:07:08.669" style="s2">story about that what&#39;s that story are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.460" end="00:07:13.990" style="s2">going to tell me and in a very real way</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.669" end="00:07:18.539" style="s2">stories teach us what&#39;s real what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.990" end="00:07:20.949" style="s2">valuable and even like what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.539" end="00:07:24.490" style="s2">what is possible so they can either</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.949" end="00:07:27.479" style="s2">constrict or expand our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.490" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">possibility through the telling of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.479" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">right and how many of us here have had</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:35.979" style="s2">the experience of being told a story or</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:38.710" style="s2">reading a story and all of a sudden we</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.979" end="00:07:41.099" style="s2">have a new sense of what might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.710" end="00:07:45.070" style="s2">possible for us or for the world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.099" end="00:07:49.570" style="s2">then we act differently all right our</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.070" end="00:07:54.849" style="s2">actions transform because of a story is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.570" end="00:08:01.720" style="s2">immaterial something that entered into</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.849" end="00:08:05.610" style="s2">our mind and then became our lives right</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.720" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">like I&#39;m here today here right here</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.610" end="00:08:11.050" style="s2">because I like went into my college</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:17.229" style="s2">library and like happen to pick out a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.050" end="00:08:19.900" style="s2">book and I read a story and then Here I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.229" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">am you know the path of my life</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.900" end="00:08:27.510" style="s2">completely altered because of a story</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:27.510" style="s2">stories are unbelievably powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.930" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">and so when we engage in an exercise</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">like we just did we might find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.150" end="00:08:46.960" style="s2">sort of or we might notice that we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:50.780" style="s2">compulsively telling ourselves stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.960" end="00:08:52.580" style="s2">right about ourselves we&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.780" end="00:08:55.850" style="s2">ourselves stories about ourselves and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.580" end="00:09:00.830" style="s2">can&#39;t really stop like we just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.850" end="00:09:02.840" style="s2">stop it&#39;s just like if if and if you if</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.830" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">you took if you actually really paid</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.840" end="00:09:07.490" style="s2">attention there&#39;s a weird way in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:10.190" style="s2">it feels really good to tell yourself a</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:07.490" style="s2">samsara right this it&#39;s a Buddhist term</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.010" end="00:10:10.550" style="s2">for like this world of suffering but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.490" end="00:10:14.510" style="s2">literal translation of it is uh going</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.550" end="00:10:18.200" style="s2">around and around going around and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.510" end="00:10:20.090" style="s2">around right which it can feel like like</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.200" end="00:10:22.460" style="s2">that is what it feels like if you just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.090" end="00:10:24.680" style="s2">sit down and like don&#39;t do a technique</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.460" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">right you just sit down you&#39;re just like</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.280" end="00:10:36.020" style="s2">just going around and around and around</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.980" end="00:10:39.380" style="s2">and around and around and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.020" end="00:10:41.630" style="s2">rehearse like the same thing in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.380" end="00:10:43.340" style="s2">slightly different way and you just kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.630" end="00:10:45.470" style="s2">of do it again because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.340" end="00:10:46.340" style="s2">you can&#39;t help it you do it again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.470" end="00:10:48.110" style="s2">it&#39;s slightly different way cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.340" end="00:10:49.310" style="s2">can&#39;t happen you drop it and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.110" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">okay this is different then you do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.310" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">again right that&#39;s just this going</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:11:00.260" style="s2">around and around and around that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:11:02.030" style="s2">what it is that well hi why do we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.260" end="00:11:04.490" style="s2">that to ourselves seriously like what is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.030" end="00:11:06.380" style="s2">it that compels us to do that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.490" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">real investigation on this path it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.380" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">like what is it that makes us do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:21.770" style="s2">and so one of the things that Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.500" end="00:11:24.350" style="s2">and you know maybe mindfulness or this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.770" end="00:11:28.940" style="s2">spiritual path more generally tells us</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">is that yeah you know stories are here</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.940" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">we have to reckon with them but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:38.780" style="s2">one particular story that you really</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">want to look at really want to pay close</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.780" end="00:11:43.730" style="s2">attention to you really want to like dig</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:47.110" style="s2">into it with whatever you got which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.730" end="00:11:50.750" style="s2">of course the story of the self right</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.110" end="00:11:52.760" style="s2">around which almost all the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.750" end="00:11:56.420" style="s2">stories we tell ourselves are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.760" end="00:11:59.840" style="s2">constellated right we have this one sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.420" end="00:12:02.330" style="s2">of master story that all other stories</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.840" end="00:12:08.450" style="s2">sort of secure themselves by latching on</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.330" end="00:12:14.390" style="s2">to you know the story of I&#39;m not good</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">enough or I could never do this or I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.390" end="00:12:21.350" style="s2">need a new iphone in order to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:25.580" style="s2">right all of those stories depend on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.350" end="00:12:28.870" style="s2">self the story of a self and just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.580" end="00:12:32.780" style="s2">anything else that we tell a story about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.870" end="00:12:36.740" style="s2">we notice that really is nowhere to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.780" end="00:12:38.270" style="s2">found right like if you really look like</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.740" end="00:12:39.800" style="s2">anything you&#39;re telling a story about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.270" end="00:12:42.590" style="s2">actually with your eyes closed sitting</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.800" end="00:12:46.280" style="s2">like this it&#39;s not present except in</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.590" end="00:12:49.850" style="s2">your mind except as the story and so in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.280" end="00:12:52.370" style="s2">these and so you know the Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.850" end="00:12:56.390" style="s2">really is trying to orient us towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.370" end="00:12:57.590" style="s2">looking at this one core story and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.390" end="00:13:05.780" style="s2">to drop all other views</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.590" end="00:13:10.460" style="s2">yeah good too and so the problem itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.780" end="00:13:12.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t so much stories but in how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.460" end="00:13:15.620" style="s2">relate to them right this compulsivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.530" end="00:13:19.480" style="s2">of being of engaging in stories of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:25.130" style="s2">kind of being addicted to stories and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:28.130" style="s2">the really tricky part of it right is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.130" end="00:13:31.580" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even often know that their</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.130" end="00:13:34.190" style="s2">stories right we don&#39;t even know their</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.580" end="00:13:37.510" style="s2">stories they&#39;re just like it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.190" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">put on like a pair of tinted glasses a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.510" end="00:13:43.070" style="s2">long time ago and we didn&#39;t even and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:45.560" style="s2">like have forgotten that we&#39;re wearing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.070" end="00:13:50.090" style="s2">glasses they&#39;re just like it&#39;s just now</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.560" end="00:13:52.400" style="s2">the way we see things right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.090" end="00:13:53.810" style="s2">can be quite startling to like take off</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.400" end="00:13:56.810" style="s2">the glasses in fact you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.810" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">put them back on because you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.810" end="00:13:59.900" style="s2">very it could be very different like I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.490" end="00:14:02.480" style="s2">you know maybe I can&#39;t I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.900" end="00:14:04.250" style="s2">things the way I used to I like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:07.880" style="s2">things away used to that&#39;s how I derived</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.250" end="00:14:11.300" style="s2">my sense of identity and often a really</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.880" end="00:14:14.120" style="s2">good teacher will go up to you and say</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.300" end="00:14:17.210" style="s2">hey i noticed that you&#39;re wearing these</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.120" end="00:14:25.640" style="s2">glasses you might want to take them off</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.210" end="00:14:30.380" style="s2">and which we might say no no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.640" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">think i do and then you know the path</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.380" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">unfolds and so one thing i find</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">especially fascinating about stories in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:49.840" style="s2">the context of our work here at CML is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">the relationship between stories and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.840" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">what we sometimes call responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.650" end="00:14:59.030" style="s2">here or what other people might refer to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.060" end="00:15:02.660" style="s2">as like social justice or cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.030" end="00:15:05.830" style="s2">change or maybe just making the world a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.660" end="00:15:05.830" style="s2">better place you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.010" end="00:15:11.300" style="s2">so we don&#39;t just tell stories to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.110" end="00:15:14.030" style="s2">ourselves of course right we tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.300" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">stories to each other and we are told</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.030" end="00:15:22.250" style="s2">stories by our culture or by you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:25.730" style="s2">television by news programs and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.250" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">task for us is not simply a huge though</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.730" end="00:15:30.440" style="s2">it is to work with learn to work with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:36.530" style="s2">stories in our own experience but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.440" end="00:15:38.590" style="s2">to play or work skillfully with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.530" end="00:15:42.710" style="s2">stories that make up our shared reality</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.590" end="00:15:46.100" style="s2">right and just like in our personal</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.710" end="00:15:50.900" style="s2">practice a really interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:55.640" style="s2">do is simply to question the stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.900" end="00:15:57.830" style="s2">that are being told right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.640" end="00:16:00.770" style="s2">for in my own practice maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.830" end="00:16:02.870" style="s2">thinking you know and I&#39;ll just say this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.770" end="00:16:06.470" style="s2">because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a real story like i</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.870" end="00:16:08.210" style="s2">really like a new phone right me i</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.470" end="00:16:11.380" style="s2">really like that new iphone it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.210" end="00:16:14.960" style="s2">like that would be a nice phone tab</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.380" end="00:16:16.340" style="s2">maybe it would make me happy to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.960" end="00:16:17.810" style="s2">that phone i don&#39;t actually say maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.340" end="00:16:21.650" style="s2">my head i say like you know that will</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.810" end="00:16:23.060" style="s2">make me but and so then you know when</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.650" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2">that story is playing in your head you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.060" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">can say really you know if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:29.660" style="s2">wherewithal you can say really like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.100" end="00:16:33.470" style="s2">really really is that going to make you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.660" end="00:16:35.180" style="s2">happy is that is that true I didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.470" end="00:16:37.190" style="s2">to get an answer to it right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.180" end="00:16:38.840" style="s2">even need to say no it&#39;s not true or</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.190" end="00:16:42.790" style="s2">well might be true or something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.840" end="00:16:45.740" style="s2">that just asking the question itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.790" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">destabilizes the story to the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.740" end="00:16:50.420" style="s2">where it can start to fade away right</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:51.800" style="s2">because most of the time that stories</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.420" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">are problem it&#39;s because we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.800" end="00:16:55.910" style="s2">question them we&#39;re just like slaves to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:58.730" style="s2">them we don&#39;t even like think about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.910" end="00:17:02.150" style="s2">right we don&#39;t even try to question them</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:05.180" style="s2">we&#39;re just like okay story like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.150" end="00:17:09.310" style="s2">whatever you say I guess I&#39;ll go buy an</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.180" end="00:17:13.880" style="s2">iphone right and millions of us do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.310" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">every day maybe unquestioningly obey the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.880" end="00:17:19.220" style="s2">demands of the stories we tell ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:22.220" style="s2">not so different</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.220" end="00:17:24.289" style="s2">culturally right so a great example this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.220" end="00:17:27.289" style="s2">that is I&#39;m really interested in is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.289" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">turn on any news channel where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.289" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">talking about economics right or about</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">national economics and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:38.299" style="s2">something like you know I have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s as accurate like gdp grew six</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.299" end="00:17:43.669" style="s2">percent this year like her ray or gdp</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.330" end="00:17:46.460" style="s2">grew two percent that wasn&#39;t so good we</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.669" end="00:17:48.890" style="s2">really need to like grow more right or</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.460" end="00:17:52.340" style="s2">they&#39;ll say you know we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.890" end="00:17:56.650" style="s2">more production or more this never</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">questioning the story of growth right</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.650" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">nobody on nobody on CNN they&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:03.080" style="s2">you know talking about a jobs report and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:04.549" style="s2">like whether or not it means that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.080" end="00:18:07.030" style="s2">economy is going to grow and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.549" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">like well hold hold on now a second like</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.030" end="00:18:12.500" style="s2">what if we&#39;re good how we are like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:14.570" style="s2">if we actually don&#39;t need to grow the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.500" end="00:18:18.650" style="s2">economy right now right nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.570" end="00:18:20.090" style="s2">questions that story on CNN you will</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.650" end="00:18:21.559" style="s2">notice if you if you see them doing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.090" end="00:18:24.919" style="s2">let me know because that&#39;s that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.559" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">fascinating to me but but you know or</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.919" end="00:18:29.150" style="s2">another great story I was I was an</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">organizer at Occupy Wall Street right</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.150" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">and so a lot of stories got questioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:35.690" style="s2">there one of the stories that got</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:39.260" style="s2">questioned there was the story of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.690" end="00:18:43.730" style="s2">ownership right this very core story to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.260" end="00:18:46.789" style="s2">our sort of national mythos are our</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.730" end="00:18:49.059" style="s2">modern world view and so to question the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.789" end="00:18:53.299" style="s2">myth or the idea the story of ownership</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.059" end="00:18:56.360" style="s2">right that anybody can own anything like</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.299" end="00:18:59.210" style="s2">what&#39;s that like you know that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.360" end="00:19:04.190" style="s2">deeply rooted story and just in the act</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.210" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">of saying it&#39;s a story you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.190" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">very powerful because most people just</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:11.929" style="s2">take it for granted they don&#39;t see it as</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:14.929" style="s2">a story they see it as the way things</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.929" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">are just like the way we see the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.929" end="00:19:23.950" style="s2">personally right we see things we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:23.950" style="s2">the way they are but of course we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.090" end="00:19:40.600" style="s2">so the the fascinating thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.140" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">practice in relationship to stories is</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.600" end="00:19:49.299" style="s2">that we see the ground lessness of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:52.860" style="s2">all right that they aren&#39;t real in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.299" end="00:19:58.440" style="s2">sense a very real sense they&#39;re not real</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.860" end="00:20:02.020" style="s2">right and that very emptiness that very</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.440" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">unreality that very like Mirage like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.020" end="00:20:09.909" style="s2">dreamlike nature of stories implies a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:15.610" style="s2">sense of malleability it implies a sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.909" end="00:20:19.390" style="s2">of that you can kind of do with it what</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.610" end="00:20:23.080" style="s2">you want right and so it opens up an</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.390" end="00:20:26.679" style="s2">opportunity for us to more consciously</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.080" end="00:20:28.750" style="s2">tell stories to be conscious about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.679" end="00:20:30.429" style="s2">stories we tell ourselves and to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.750" end="00:20:32.649" style="s2">conscious about the stories we tell each</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.429" end="00:20:34.120" style="s2">other and to toe and to be consciously</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.649" end="00:20:40.659" style="s2">the stories we tell as a culture as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.120" end="00:20:44.260" style="s2">people all right so um if the world is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.659" end="00:20:45.850" style="s2">made of stories to whatever degree we</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.260" end="00:20:47.770" style="s2">see that or know that to be true the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.850" end="00:20:49.750" style="s2">world is made of stories then therefore</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.770" end="00:20:57.399" style="s2">we can create a new world with new</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.750" end="00:21:02.260" style="s2">stories that&#39;s a huge huge information</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.399" end="00:21:04.409" style="s2">huge thing to know and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.260" end="00:21:06.520" style="s2">endeavor to be more conscious about</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.409" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">storytelling this thing that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.520" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">anyways unless you&#39;re not in which case</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:16.090" style="s2">I would also like to talk to you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.490" end="00:21:17.470" style="s2">they really interesting you know there</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.090" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">are some there are some questions that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.470" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">we might we might ask ourselves and I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">want to end with some some questions you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:31.030" style="s2">know to to help us be more conscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:34.420" style="s2">about our storytelling so</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.030" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">one question that I thought of was what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.420" end="00:21:40.980" style="s2">stories do I presently feel are the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:40.980" style="s2">meaningful and wise</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.690" end="00:21:59.059" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.789" end="00:22:04.759" style="s2">question probably changes but it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.059" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">to ask ourselves another question what</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.759" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">false and perhaps toxic stories from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:16.549" style="s2">media or culture have slipped their way</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:21.470" style="s2">into my consciousness short story about</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.549" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">this I find myself I&#39;m 27 almost 28 now</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.470" end="00:22:28.100" style="s2">and I find myself sort of passing</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:30.200" style="s2">through a cultural gate as i call it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.100" end="00:22:33.649" style="s2">where it&#39;s like there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.200" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">stories about that for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.649" end="00:22:39.019" style="s2">have been put into my consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:43.190" style="s2">about what I should be doing at this age</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.019" end="00:22:48.190" style="s2">and none of those stories involve me</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.190" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">sitting here doing this right so like</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:53.570" style="s2">there&#39;s some tension there and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:55.549" style="s2">realizing now I&#39;m unearthing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.570" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">that like yeah I&#39;m actually like this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.549" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">another layer that I&#39;ve been programmed</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:10.610" style="s2">or been you know yeah enchanted by a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:12.860" style="s2">story right a false story yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.610" end="00:23:15.259" style="s2">may show up in all of our lives in so</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.860" end="00:23:16.700" style="s2">many different ways and it&#39;s one that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.259" end="00:23:18.769" style="s2">one thing is fascinating to me too is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.700" end="00:23:21.259" style="s2">how we&#39;re decentering the storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.769" end="00:23:23.539" style="s2">from you know perhaps the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.259" end="00:23:24.379" style="s2">media into things like Facebook all</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.539" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">right we&#39;re telling each other stories</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.379" end="00:23:30.470" style="s2">on that medium now what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:34.429" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know but probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.470" end="00:23:37.429" style="s2">something another another question what</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.429" end="00:23:43.990" style="s2">story or stories do i subscribe to about</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.429" end="00:23:46.279" style="s2">political change power or progress right</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.990" end="00:23:49.250" style="s2">we may all have different stories about</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.279" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">that we can&#39;t change anything like</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.250" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">change is just around the corner voting</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:56.659" style="s2">voting doesn&#39;t change anything voting is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:23:59.299" style="s2">the only thing that matters you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.659" end="00:24:01.430" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing like the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.299" end="00:24:04.820" style="s2">stories that we tell about</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.430" end="00:24:09.110" style="s2">is meaningful in terms of changing our</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.820" end="00:24:11.480" style="s2">very sick society it&#39;s good to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.110" end="00:24:13.910" style="s2">conscious about that to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.480" end="00:24:17.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a story and that therefore we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.910" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">choose a better story and then act from</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.180" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">that better story if we so choose if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">so choose and then the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">question for me right now living here is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.910" end="00:24:43.820" style="s2">what stories do I want to live or what</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.380" end="00:24:47.780" style="s2">stories do you want to live or set in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2">slightly different way that that feels</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.780" end="00:24:56.270" style="s2">more provocative to me what stories want</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.460" end="00:24:57.920" style="s2">want to come to life through me what</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.270" end="00:25:02.210" style="s2">stories want to come through life to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.920" end="00:25:06.740" style="s2">life through you maybe you have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.210" end="00:25:09.170" style="s2">of that maybe you feel yourself pulled</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.740" end="00:25:12.170" style="s2">by something by a story a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.170" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">story that wants to come to life through</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.170" end="00:25:17.230" style="s2">you good to know that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.860" end="00:25:46.120" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll end with two quotes I like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.830" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">quotes i found one is a from gary snyder</p>
