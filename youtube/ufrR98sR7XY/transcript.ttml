<p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">this is eric with a few thoughts for</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">this week&#39;s housekeeping what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">bring up this week is how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">the portal podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:15.679" style="s2">and in particular i want to give a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">thoughts on how we should measure the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.679" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">scale of a critique</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">or the power of an idea and how these</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.039" end="00:00:22.960" style="s2">two different concepts might interrelate</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">many years ago i used to live in</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.960" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">cambridge massachusetts and we had our</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">own very peculiar notion of celebrities</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:30.160" style="s2">back then i mean tracy chapman literally</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">used to bust on the street for money</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">and npr&#39;s car talk guys lived locally it</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">was within that milieu that i would go</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">to talks for entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">as a broke graduate student lecturers</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">were a godsend as they were free and</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:42.160" style="s2">plentiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">i would attend them the way other people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.160" end="00:00:45.520" style="s2">would go to movies or concerts and from</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">time to time that would include noam</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.520" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">chomsky&#39;s lectures on political theory</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">as he worked at mit</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">i was always impressed by his sincerity</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">and sometimes i would stay after and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">talk with him</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">on one such occasion i told him that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">had had a conversation with a contacted</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:00.399" style="s2">npr</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">and that that person might be interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.399" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">in getting him a regular slot</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">of perhaps five minutes or more i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">naturally very excited to make something</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">like this happen if it were in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">gnome&#39;s response was surprising to me at</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">the time he was absolutely emphatic that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">he was not interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">somewhat stung i asked him why he was so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">definite</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">he replied in such a small slot against</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">a backdrop of npr-filtered news he would</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">appear to the audience to be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">stark-raving madman</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">and that there was no way of presenting</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">a deep critique so as to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.920" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">relentless framing of the news into</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">narratives in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">npr was engaging i have thought about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">that interchange many times since then</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">as i have been haunted by its</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">what good after all is a chomsky level</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">analysis if it is barred from having any</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">impact when done at scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">when we have a critique of a well-known</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">narrative or worldview it usually can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">sorted into a taxonomy according to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">whether it accepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">bends or is forced to break the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">the storyline with which it contends</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">as an example imagine we were back in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">2016 and i were to critique the coverage</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.079" style="s2">of the u.s presidential election for</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">failing to contend with the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.079" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">saying that i feel that we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">covering trump sufficiently because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">all know that hillary is going to win</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">would constitute a critique but one that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">accepts the narrative without challenge</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">saying instead hillary is going to beat</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">donald trump by much less than she</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.319" style="s2">imagines and will have to build her</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">mandate after the inauguration if she is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.319" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">would bend the hillary&#39;s inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">media narrative</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">but saying instead i think all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">pundits and polls are wrong and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">donald trump should be expected to win</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">would break the narrative entirely this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">breaking of the frame is usually cause</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">for derision</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">and is of course exactly what got ann</p>

<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">she made just that prediction</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">to return to our story in massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">almost all of chomsky&#39;s points were in</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">to accept chomsky was to accept a world</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">of different stories that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">oddly enough could usually be</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">authenticated but which were frequently</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">not referenced</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:10.879" style="s2">outside far left circles thus chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">could not play inside the game of npr</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.879" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">which was often bending and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">challenging official narratives</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">but seldom ever breaking the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:19.280" style="s2">frames within which the storylines</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.280" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">in short planet chomsky was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">alternative universe in which a howard</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">zinn might be found</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">but where you would never find samuel</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">huntington or henry kissinger</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">i mean they might have taught down the</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">code one digit off but it was another</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">incompatible universe entirely so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">can one say about the style of deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">critique which must break the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">its target without knowing any further</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">well in the first place no one can</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">really argue that all frame breaking is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">unwarranted</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">i mean clearly the u.s view of north</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">korea is such a critique for example</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">as is the mainstream baptist critique of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">an offshoot cult</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">like the hate-fueled westboro baptist</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">church and yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">when the narrative under scrutiny is our</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">own narrative the very one upon which we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">depend</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">to give direction meaning and security</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">in our daily lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">we can be relied upon to fight</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">everything that breaks our frame</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">as is our reflex</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">well i&#39;m glad to say that noam chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">is still going strong and i dare to</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">often speaks to me in riddles and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">sometimes reminds me in speech of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">jimi hendrix used to struggle to talk to</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">if one looks at the musical notation</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">meant to say what hendrix was doing on</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">it is remarkable how little is captured</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:19.920" style="s2">this is because hendrix expanded the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">dimensionality of the guitar with</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">sound that was being woven</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">in many ways eric has done the same</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">so just as les paul preceded hendricks</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.519" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">in using the studio as an instrument and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">flamenco artists were tapping on</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">when eric ripped the cover off the piano</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">that had plagued it since his birth</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">one of the great triumphs of pure</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">ensured that there was regularity to</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">he calls counter bop which quite frankly</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s really interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">you occur in our era from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">a lot of our popular music has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">getting simpler as it was getting more</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">intricate and more dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">musicianship</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">back in the 70s and a lot of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">seeing is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">shift to the studio to simpler forms and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">you come along and for my money you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">innovating</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">at the very highest levels of jazz</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">rock and pop all at the same time are</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">you seeing something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">where you were somehow like a salmon</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">swimming counter to the stream or do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">think that you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">a part of our age and in fact it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:57.440" style="s2">same as it ever was</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">thank you first of all</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.440" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">for saying that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">i think of myself as just</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">an arch traditionalist in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">part of the tradition of jazz</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">indeed individuate as carl young might</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">say perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">you know that is the focus</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">that i find myself orbiting</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.799" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s my pursuit i&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.400" style="s2">painted myself in a corner</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.840" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">in a lot of different ways and i use</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.400" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">sort of sense of being trapped or</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">forced to commit to this thing that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">painted myself into a corner with</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">and i use that particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">situation that particular scenario to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">drive out and bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">forth innovation as they say ingenuity</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.320" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">what is that necessity as the mother of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">ingenuity or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">mother of invention well that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">thing so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">for for people who don&#39;t know you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">they&#39;re going to not only know you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">hopefully but we have a beautiful yamaha</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">piano behind us they&#39;re going to feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">uh shortly um let me just give you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">sort of a non-musician&#39;s impression</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">of where i&#39;ve seen you innovating okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">first of all you&#39;ve taken what used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">be called prepared piano where people</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">would leave like bricks and paper clips</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">in the back of the piano</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">and you&#39;ve stuck your hand in there to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">coax all sorts of sounds out</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">that add a such a rich dimensionality to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">your playing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">you have access to many more degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">freedom than a standard person</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">so you&#39;re playing in the back and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">front of the piano</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve innovated this idea which you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">called rock jazz which was a canonical</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">innovation in that originally when jazz</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">was coming up</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">people used the popular songs of the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">as the substrate on which to improvise</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">and you you pointed out that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">autumn leaves is not a part of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">current canon</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a part of our older canon so why</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">not use the rock songs that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">knows is the substrate to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">true not to the letter but to the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">of jazz which is to use that which</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">everyone knows and show them something</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">huge innovation um like all of the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">uh you know jerry lee lewis footage</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">where he kicks away the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">the the bench and he&#39;s just playing</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">standing there you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">in insane powerful stance you use this</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">to you know to convey the aggression</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">and i think you know i always talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">the violence of creativity one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">reasons we&#39;re afraid of creativity is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">that we&#39;re afraid that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">created creativity is always a violent</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">act you came up with this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">counter bop where you&#39;re bringing sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">of bach-like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">counterpoint into a into the jazz idiom</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">and achieving a level of independence uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">we say of your hands but of parts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">your mind that i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever seen at the at</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">to say nothing of how you&#39;ve innovated</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">uh i&#39;m starting to hear that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">djing from inside of the piano</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">it feels to me like everything you touch</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">is a response</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">to a constraint that you take on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">constraints of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">and then you force yourself houdini-like</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">to break out of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">is that an accurate description of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">it is that&#39;s driving this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">explosion</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">i would say that most of it is accurate</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">some of it would be argued</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">from the perspective of branding and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">that sort of kind of thing but isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">that part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:55.039" style="s2">the tradition right so so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">you know that&#39;s part of creativity too</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s important as well so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">i would definitely say that counter bop</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">of all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">the innovations is one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">got the heaviest musical</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">academic durability</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">i would say that rock jazz was</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">innovative</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">however i&#39;m not the first person to play</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">rock tunes or rock covers on a piano</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">i think i might be the first person to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">sort of go at it with the ferocity</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">and the physical degree of power and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">endurance</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">fidelity to those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">so i think that i go about that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">particular endeavor in an innovative way</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">branding it as rock jazz perhaps that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">innovative</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">and using that as a wedge</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">to create an extension of my career</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s an innovative</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">quality there i would say counter bob</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">which is a more recent situation more</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">recent device</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">that i&#39;ve come up with that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">that i can definitely say is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">innovative in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">i really haven&#39;t heard anyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">mix bach counterpoint with bebop</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people that have</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">baroque counterpoint european</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">counterpoint</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">into jazz however</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">and this is for all of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">are going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">immediately pounce on this statement or</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">scream</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">wail that oh it has been done before</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">actually no</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t it hasn&#39;t been done in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">swinging way</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">so the idea that jazz doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">swing</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">or that sort of kind of a thing right</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a thing and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">wormhole right there can go very deep</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">but suffice to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">that no playing</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">bach counterpoint or that sort of kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">inside of jazz is very different from</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">counter bop which is why i call it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">counter bop right it&#39;s not counter point</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s counter bop so that you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">two bud powell or two charlie parker</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">like lines full of all of their internal</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">striations and internal</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">acrobatics shall we say harmonic melodic</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">acrobatics</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">working within the traditions of swing</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">the traditions of bebop at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">there are a couple of pianists that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">do have some very highly developed left</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">a good degree but i haven&#39;t heard anyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">get it to like the highest levels</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">and i believe that i&#39;ve found a way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">i have to say this because i&#39;m not a</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">so discriminating as to the fine points</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">is the way in which you&#39;re willing to</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">and totally uh overturn the apple cart</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">at the same time so that you&#39;re really</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">and i think the people who will resist</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">method whenever possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">so from the perspective of the human</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">animal</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">you know every sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">opinion about this or that as far as</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">sound goes or as far as</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">as far as certitude or validity</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">for instance if you put kenny g&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">next to miles davis name</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">i think that it&#39;s difficult to have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">truly acerbic scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.799" style="s2">conversation about that there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">be those that feel as though kenny g</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.799" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">is the greatest musician that&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">lived</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be those that think</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">that miles davis</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.679" style="s2">is the greatest musician that ever lived</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">there will be those that think that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">calling someone the greatest musician</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">that ever lived israel</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">itself yeah this flawed i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">has a bias inherent in it that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">intrinsically undermines</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:03.760" style="s2">the sort of conversation or the purity</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">the purity no no it&#39;s fine no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.760" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">fine i i</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">i feel as though it&#39;s important as far</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">in the process of me answering your</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">question and sure in the process of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">getting a sense of who i am and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">you know i feel about things or how i</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">you know classify things</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">so that answers the first aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">my approach to comparison got it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">so existentially speaking</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of the same depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">you know for instance</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">you could do a mind hack where you turn</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">on a television</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">and switch the channel to something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">just gives you white noise</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">right now you can do a mind hack where</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">you could hear jingle bells inside of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">that white noise you can pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">hear whatever you&#39;re listening cage</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">certainly explored ideas like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">right you can hear whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">listening for in something</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">and this goes to politics this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">this goes all the way out into all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">human thought and bias endeavors right</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">so i shot i&#39;m a chess player so i shy</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">away from</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">that particular battle line i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">shy away</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">from putting a qualitative or a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">valid validation oriented thing with</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">regards to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">the kenny g versus the miles let me take</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">kenny g out of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a no it&#39;s a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">actually you&#39;re not going to let me out</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">of it okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s perfect though all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">perfect riff with it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s perfect the extremities</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">always allow us to get to clarity as far</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">as i&#39;m concerned and that&#39;s a big aspect</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">of what i look at when i&#39;m evaluating</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">things you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">the more extreme something is the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">pronounced it is the purer it is and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:53.360" style="s2">easier</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">we can see how it functions</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">in reality our political climate is one</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:29:58.880" style="s2">of extremes these days</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">so then it&#39;s very clear everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.880" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">agendas are very clear</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">and so we can see how those things</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">interact and where they agree where they</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">you know the basis is upon the bases</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">the basis is base cc&#39;s or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">word is the plural basis</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">the bases upon which each extreme side</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">proffers you know their position to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">concrete well anyway so when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">the aspect of classifying levels of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">greatness in musicians and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">that becomes a difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">to nail down because of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">the movable objective criteria the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">the attackability of the objective</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">criteria that we would try to put out</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">right but what we can talk about we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">talk about branding</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">we can say or we can talk about physical</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">difficulties we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">things like that um i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">you know all of the question but</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">i can say that as far as who really</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">inspires me</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">yeah in that sense at the highest level</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">right at the highest level to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">yeah to me i&#39;m highly inspired by john</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">just to open something up and i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">this is the perfect episode to do it i</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t said it before</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">there are the n is often too low</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">in any particular field the number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">true geniuses like if i think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">physics there are lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">would be considered geniuses in any</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">other field but like the top level</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">it&#39;s five people or less than the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">century you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">and so you have to aggregate over field</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">by field by field</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:15.519" style="s2">if you want to see the pattern and in</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">define where you look for inspiration</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:19.599" style="s2">i&#39;m referring to in their own mind in</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">their own flesh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:26.879" style="s2">a profound in-house understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">of where to put the music and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.879" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">what approaches to take</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">similar to a chess player in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">that a chess game if you know how the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">pieces move</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">okay cool yeah and if you as long as</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">functioning in some kind of way that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">can either digitally</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">or physically move pieces around you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">be part of the game</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">so now how do the levels begin how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">you get from there to magnus carlsen</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">and so that internal game of okay why</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">did you decide to defend this</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">when in fact the greater attack was</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">coming over here you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">stuff okay so there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">analogy with jazz in a weird way which</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">is if i go back</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">to the guy i think of as potentially the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">greatest creative genius</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">of jazz arguably would be louis</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">armstrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">who sort of invented modern jazz from</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">the hot fives hot sevens</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.560" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">not just like the jelly roll mortons of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">that is understandable to me in the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">way that a game of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">morphy or capoblanca was understandable</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.000" style="s2">when chess was sort of in an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">stage of its development</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.000" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">but as both of these fields progressed</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">you always have this problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">the greater play loses the casual</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">observer</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">like they can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">on and i i</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">i bring this up in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">something i saw you hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">herbie hancock and it warmed my heart</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">i heard him describe playing with miles</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">yes and he said i hit a chord that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">wrong and so off i wanted to clutch my</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">and he said what i didn&#39;t know is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">there was a level of musicianship beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">where miles heard the same chord and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">figured out the exact right notes to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">that made it the right chord in arrears</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">and it was a keyboard player</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">you know talking about a trumpet player</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">who was</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">fixing his mistake because he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">hear it as a mistake he just heard it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">to be played with and i think about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">in in terms of like the improvisational</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">idiom</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">yes and there are levels and levels and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">levels and they lose us as casual</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">observers like</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">would we have known that moment happened</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">if we were in that club</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">or at that recording date if we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">at the top level of the profession</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">well i think as they say if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">good plumber</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">you never know anything&#39;s wrong right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">we&#39;re in the business of not letting the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">audience know that anything has gone</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">now analyzing the word wrong and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">sort of kind of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s where a matter of skill and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">understanding come into play we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">talking about phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">at that point we&#39;re talking about event</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">horizons we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">existentialism at that point let me be</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">slightly less obtuse in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.880" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">world of film scoring yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">bernard harmon was the one</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">who made the famous statement about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">great paradox that exists</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">in music where a piece of music could</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">quote unquote be terrible</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">you know it could be really weak bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">have a lot of inconsistencies</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">fail at a lot of different levels</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">clearly be</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">execution of those aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">however however</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">with the right visual apparatus going</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">with the right film going with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">suddenly that piece of music is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">penultimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">apex zenith of yeah the perfection</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">for that particular moment this is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">great paradox</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">so similarly when herbie played that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">chord</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">yeah miles definitely aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">type of paradox can come to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">and put a sound with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">that transcends one aspect of sonority</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">transcends one aspect of analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">speaks</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">as miles davis said a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">it speaks to a higher level of theory if</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">coming from the perspective that any</p>

<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">is just a sound free of bias free of</p>

<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">and so then it just becomes a question</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">put that term to it movement</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">work towards that same thing movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">einstein said when asked about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">when asked about god something&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something moving so</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">and yet he froze it in space-time the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">whole concept of space-time</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">freezes the wave and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">something profound about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">his insight</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">arguably got rid of movement by putting</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">time as part of the substrate</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">so you know and this is going to come up</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">cubism where you have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">on this new project which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">again once once again seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">increasing the dimensionality of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">independence like parts</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">no longer it&#39;s just two parts of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">hands being independent like multiple</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">parts of the same hand are now</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">independent</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">um and that goes back to like duchamp</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">with the nude descending staircase which</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">was a somewhat something of a reference</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">to space and time where the tube</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">of the nude like one human form</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">creates a tube over time do you see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">you&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:30.760" style="s2">sort of concepts that are coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.760" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">science-inspired exploration and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">even internal to somebody like einstein</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">is it movement or is it frozen</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">i&#39;m quite inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">neuroanatomy and i&#39;m quite inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">a good buddy of mine is far more</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">articulate about math and physics than i</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">am he&#39;s you know a big devotee</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">of that stuff and he&#39;s a musician his</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">name&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">marcus miller not the bass player he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">saxophone player yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">but he&#39;s really interesting and so he</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">and i you know talk about stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:14.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">i tend more towards the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.119" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">neuroanalytical side of things so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">the human the homunculus and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">interested in the hippocampus and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">the corpus corpus colossus and how the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">different hemispheres of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">enable movement which plays directly</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">into my coordination so i explore</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">those kinds of spaces i explore how we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:37.359" style="s2">perceive time</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">less so than the actual substrate of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">time itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">and you know although i do ponder those</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">i am very concerned with what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">under the hood you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">going on in the mind i like to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">transcripts of conversations between</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">someone who has dementia versus someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">who has alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">and listen to them talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">and how they understand each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">because to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the same as like two pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">music being played at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">you know because when something</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">makes no sense yeah at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">language level yeah or it&#39;s incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">the only way that we have to try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">glean anything from it is by analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">from a different perspective so if i</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">analyze it as music</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">like the rhythm of my voice you see what</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">these are the kinds of techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">manners and methods of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">that start to come into how i go about</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">assessing genius pursuing genius</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">and pursuing challenges and pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:57.040" style="s2">at what i do and so getting back to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">question of miles davis and kenny g</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.040" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">yeah again we&#39;re starting we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">to get into topics</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">that form the substrate of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">analysis these are the all these topics</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">are the components of a platform of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">through which i ponder</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">the event horizon of of music and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">musicians</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">so like lex luthor said</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">to otis and superman you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">some people</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">who can swerve some people can movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">some people can look at the contents of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">a bubble gum rapper</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">yeah and people figure out the secrets</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">yeah what i&#39;m saying so that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">if we want to pejoratively what call</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">kenny g a bubble gum rapper but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">actually i know you didn&#39;t i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">accusing you that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">all right i&#39;m just saying yeah i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">saying but so many people normally do</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">this is why i&#39;m the reason i chose just</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">folks at home the reason i chose kenny g</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">was that he was accessible i agree and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">just like bubble gum</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">bubble gum people would argue people</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">would argue right</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">that his music is bubble gum compared to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">a filet mignon or a few well where i was</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">going next with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">is is that if i think about two records</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">of miles</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">uh bitches brew versus kind of blue sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">bitch&#39;s brew was pretty challenging even</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.319" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">though it was trying to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">more in the rock idiom sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">kind of blue despite the fact that it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">unbelievable musicianship was inviting</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">and it became so iconic because</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">it worked at so many different levels it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">tell me you know uh bug off kid</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">this is for experts only it said this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">the highest level of musicianship</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to work in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">can put it on</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">without having to you know just</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">break your head over when i think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">art tatum</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">when i used to put the needle onto my</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">vinyl art tatum albums</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">i would only do it if i was in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">place to receive</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">the brilliance of this person that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">could not possibly understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">he was playing so fast and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">technically</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">at such a different level i mean i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">would it be fair to say that many</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">pianists consider art tatum</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">you know at the absolute maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">the top guy ever to play jazz piano sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.559" style="s2">many would</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">and then there would be those there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.559" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">claim that it&#39;s not that musical i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">you know go contrary to that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s okay but just some some</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">people at home have never heard of art</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">tatum at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">at another level there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">different times for different things and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">different moods</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:52.400" style="s2">to every scene too yeah right you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">there&#39;s situations where art tatum&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.400" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">best would be inappropriate or</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what very few circumstances in my</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">life do i</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:02.800" style="s2">think wow i really just want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">some art tatum the only situation i&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.800" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">when i really</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">feel that for myself and again not as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">musician</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">is when i want to remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">human mind is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">and this is the great conundrum this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">the great paradox because</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">as we were saying someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">could hear kenny g&#39;s silhouette for</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">and experience profound tranquility and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">serendipity they could listen to yanny</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">and get that there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">if you go to youtube you can look at a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">comment and someone would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">oh he&#39;s the mozart of our generation</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">something like that so incredulity</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">yeah is there&#39;s i&#39;m sure of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard of it the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">the fallacy of the incredulity fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">where just because it&#39;s impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">you to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">find believable makes it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">untrue so similarly</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">there&#39;s only a certain threshold that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">classifying or dissecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">validity or worth can go and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">you know let me put it to you this way</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a story about charlie parker</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">where he was at a club and he was</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.280" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">listening to a guy play</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">that was to everyone else&#39;s opinion</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">you know really weak but charlie parker</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">was like really into checking it out</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">and he was able to hear things inside of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">what that guy was doing or what that guy</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:41.359" style="s2">was going for</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">that gave him ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.359" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">i think when i was first starting out</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">with rock jazz</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">that was something that i experienced</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">in a different kind of way where when i</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">started hearing some of these young</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:56.839" style="s2">bands</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">and i would hear some of their live</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.839" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">shows on the internet at that time</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">on youtube i would think to myself man</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.359" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really sound that great but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">people are loving it yeah and so then</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">that caused me to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">have a different thought process about</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s other aspects that are in</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:21.040" style="s2">play that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">connect to people&#39;s enjoyment of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.040" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">and so you know it really called some</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">things into question you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">it really caused me to think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">from multiple perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">basically it threw me into the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just like what we see in politics</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">where you can feel really strongly about</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">a particular thing then you can find out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">there&#39;s others that feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">even potentially for the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">reasons that you feel strongly about a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">for those exact same reasons they feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">the exact opposite thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">and it can be very a very incredulous</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">sort of kind of situation i i bring up</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">this example of dolly parton writing</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">brilliant song jolene and if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">the lyrics they&#39;re incredibly tight and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">economical and conveying so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">more through implication than they even</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">state explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">jack white heard the song record it with</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">the white stripes turned it into a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">pre-murder ballad singing the</p>

<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">and dolly parton i believe wrote him a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">letter saying you may understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">something about guitar but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">understand nothing about women but i</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">think the joke was on her that she&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">written such a brilliant song</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.319" style="s2">that she didn&#39;t realize that it was now</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">approachable from a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.319" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">angle that she hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">had the last word on her own song so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">there are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">weird and that reminds me of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:54.800" style="s2">difference between</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.240" style="s2">start to break down at the quantum level</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">you would say that classical physics is</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">recoverable from the deeper model but</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">only as an approximation to the true</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">within a regime and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">he but you know we nobody has thrown</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">away newtonian physics because of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">einstein because where it works you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">don&#39;t need the extra einsteinian</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">perspective now that was an amazing stay</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">trapped did you trap me in something</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">no you just said something cool though</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:45.839" style="s2">you just said something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">blows the whole thing open very nicely</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">tell me</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">well we don&#39;t need necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">x we don&#39;t need to discard</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">x in this location or we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">necessarily need to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">y to this location so we can substitute</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">art tatum for rachmaninoff yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">algebraically plug in kenny g miles we</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.160" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">can plug</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">in whichever artists or things that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">want to in a thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">and have that same exact dichotomy of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">this works in this particular space eric</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">i totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">you see where i&#39;m going with that so</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">similarly</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">let&#39;s just say people want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">romantic evening but eric</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">look there is an aspect of this that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">fighting which</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">you&#39;re making a very deep point that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">whatever moves you whether it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:42.559" style="s2">the performer looks</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">or the the feel of the evening</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">there is the total effect on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">audience and the listener from having</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">been present at a performance</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">there is also something which i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">get escape which is you&#39;re just at a</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">different level than just about anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">i ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">meet and you we can play around with</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">that and you know i play a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">piano</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">i know when i&#39;m being uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">when i&#39;m in the presence of greatness</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">and you are at a different</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">level than almost anybody i&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to say anything back</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">uncomfortable thing to hear we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">who knows maybe taylor swift is as</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">musically interesting as mile davis it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s not what i&#39;m saying that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">not what i&#39;m saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">let&#39;s look at it from a different</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">perspective yes another perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:40.319" style="s2">let&#39;s look at it from a dj perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">all right what is a dj&#39;s job a dj&#39;s job</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.319" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">one of the jobs of a dj is to curate</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">and present music right for people for a</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">particular occasion</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">to elicit either a certain response or</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">to provide an atmosphere that the venue</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">or the client is interested in</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">now if we take that down to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">microcosmic level</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">inside of our own head take it to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">piano for instance</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">take it to these instrumental scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">each note that i decide to play in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">nanosecond in that microsecond right i</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">decide to play it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the same as me djing that note</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">is a track now imagine</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">how many notes that you would hear in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">the average performance and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:28.480" style="s2">in my case i&#39;m going to play a zillion</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">notes</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.480" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">right yeah so then that&#39;s a zillion</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">tracks</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">that i&#39;ve dropped in a particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">or a particular session</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:45.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to get into how</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">mental processes are uniform</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.760" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">whether it&#39;s at a hyper slow speed</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">yeah or a hyper fast speed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">the same process is there so this</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:58.400" style="s2">conversation that we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">might seem nebulous or maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.400" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">evasive on my part</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:04.000" style="s2">or vague in my part or non-committal no</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">i should tell people that in general</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.000" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">when you and i talk</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">what i get is a time release</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">understanding of your points over the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">next three or four days as they finally</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">make sense to me so</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to challenge my audience i</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">told them at the beginning of this show</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">that i would never</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">spoon feed them you are a more</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">challenging person to talk to because</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">quite frankly your perspective is just</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">richer and you speak in an unusual</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">fashion and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">quite frankly it takes me days to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">understand what conversation we just had</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">well i i appreciate the accolades and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">love you too</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">eric and i i really love you i just</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">admire what you&#39;ve done for us and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">going to blow people&#39;s mind by just</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">letting you be you</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">but it is important to know that these</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">levels of being exist and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">why the show is called the portal is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">that you are</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">in touch with something that most people</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">have no idea is even available</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">well i will say that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">i do find inspiration</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:10.839" style="s2">having recovered from</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">heavy depression and heavy panic attacks</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.839" end="00:57:15.359" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">sort of debilitating ones that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.359" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">for me to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">try to share perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.839" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">hopefully some people could use to get a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.640" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">different angle on their sufferings say</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">like when i talk about some of these</p>

<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">remember how the james khan character</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">sunny yeah ran out the house because</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">the way to get him out there because</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">he&#39;ll jump on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">and so then they manipulate the toba</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">yeah they manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">his anger they manipulated one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">that was predictable about him</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:41.359" style="s2">and they manipulated that to get out</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">there so similarly i think within</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.359" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">there are certain weak spots or</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">that can manipulate us whether we want</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">to or not</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">into bad situations or you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a micro bad situation or macro bad</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important to develop</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:06.480" style="s2">to manage those kinds of things ergo</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">techniques and responses</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.359" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">all played to trying to</p>

<p begin="01:02:08.720" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">different levels i think maybe one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.119" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">my mistakes here is is that i need to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:18.000" style="s2">get you in front of the piano first</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">quite as back footed i shouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">i think that it&#39;s actually a spectacular</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.240" end="01:02:45.039" style="s2">thing because it&#39;s really going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">a type of provocative</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.039" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">and easily recognizable maybe people</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">will distinction</p>

<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">making with regards to distinction</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:58.640" style="s2">yeah how do we tell things apart so we</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">have to use</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.640" end="01:03:02.640" style="s2">things that are very distinct in order</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">for us to have a distinction in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.640" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s the same thing that</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">you know cinematically or as far as</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">the power of such a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">topic that seems what is that</p>

<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">have to do with a dance competition but</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.799" end="01:05:10.720" style="s2">think about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">as a screenwriter i thought about it if</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.720" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">you take that out</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">right then you&#39;re sitting with pen and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.039" style="s2">paper and you&#39;re like okay well i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">this dance competition i&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.039" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">dancer</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve got this klutz so the the good guy</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">that you know the great dancer</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">needs to teach this klutz right how to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">dance so that he can win the competition</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">now if you replace that other scenario</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:33.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">multiple types of problems you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.440" end="01:05:36.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard to get something as</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:39.359" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.640" end="01:05:40.079" style="s2">as that however that person took a heavy</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.359" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">risk now the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.079" end="01:05:45.839" style="s2">screenwriter was a woman so then she</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">yeah the screenwriter is a woman and she</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.839" end="01:05:50.240" style="s2">was a mambo dancer and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">she was her father was a doctor and she</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.240" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">went to country clubs and so she</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">experienced this dickens like type of</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">life where</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">you know there&#39;s rich and poor and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:01.200" style="s2">know all these kinds of things and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:03.920" style="s2">sure her father</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.200" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">was you know warning her about the um</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.920" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:07.520" style="s2">the dangers of sexual activity and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:09.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.520" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">pitfalls and what he&#39;s seen and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.119" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">like that so she put that all together</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">so perhaps because she had an experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">with it and she&#39;s a woman</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:19.440" style="s2">that she was able to speak on those</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:22.559" style="s2">subjects so</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.440" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">amazingly and she had the understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.559" end="01:06:25.599" style="s2">of how to bring</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">those subjects together because she</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:29.039" style="s2">lived it right you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.319" style="s2">however it wouldn&#39;t occur to the average</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">person but this is what we call</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.319" end="01:06:34.799" style="s2">genius you know what i&#39;m saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:37.839" style="s2">genius and it&#39;s lasted the test of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.799" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">but that&#39;s my whole point with why</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.839" end="01:06:42.160" style="s2">the whole opening and this gets back to</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.160" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">talking about genius and things like</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">you did a genius thing yet you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:51.680" style="s2">to get me</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:52.319" style="s2">to discount that or go away from that</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.680" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.319" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">identifying you&#39;re a genius and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">ties to what i was saying about</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">how charlie parker would hear a guy that</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">people would say</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:02.079" style="s2">what&#39;s he talking about but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">listening intently</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.079" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point you see all these</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:08.319" style="s2">things come together if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">created this podcast as the example of</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.319" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">the thing that we were talking about in</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:12.400" style="s2">the podcast yeah these are wheels within</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">wheels</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.400" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">yeah this is the universe is within</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">universes quantum it all breaks down at</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">this level but it holds at this level</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">this is why we love having you over for</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:22.799" style="s2">shabbat</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:24.240" style="s2">all that kind of thing so you did it</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.799" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">from the very beginning all right your</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.240" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">instinctive</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">thing you i didn&#39;t force you to choose</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:32.079" style="s2">those names</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:34.400" style="s2">yeah you naturally chose those names</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.079" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">all i&#39;m doing yeah is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.400" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">that i would do inside of my mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:41.760" style="s2">if i get an idea the sensor yeah filter</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">in my mind&#39;s like wow</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.760" end="01:07:45.039" style="s2">that&#39;s actually pretty cool because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:46.160" style="s2">referencing all these other things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.039" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">seeing all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.160" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a chess game i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:52.799" style="s2">the checkmate i&#39;m like wow this king</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">is positioned over here okay i&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.799" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">do this in such a way that by the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to spring this trap</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.920" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t even see that that subtle</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.240" end="01:08:01.839" style="s2">move he made actually provides</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.920" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">the funny thing is i think i chose kenny</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.839" end="01:08:05.359" style="s2">g if i recall correctly</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">yeah because i think i remember hearing</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.359" end="01:08:07.760" style="s2">that he had had</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">he had actually been an innovator with</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.760" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">some circular breathing technique</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">and that he was somebody who was seen as</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.799" style="s2">being middle of the road but actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">a good deal above that in musicianship</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.799" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">so i think i had some different process</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">i wish it was that i had some some super</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">clever idea but it was probably only one</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:26.719" style="s2">one or two moves deep but thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">saying it still</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.719" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">functions well that&#39;s the but because</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">through dancing</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:33.759" style="s2">i get to dance with you so so you get to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">do what</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.759" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">miles did to my herbie hancock move and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">just like in</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:41.279" style="s2">dirty dancing he had to take what she</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">was doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.279" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">right and from what i&#39;ve understood</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">about dancing</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:49.199" style="s2">in that particular format it&#39;s the man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.199" end="01:08:56.319" style="s2">in traditionally to showcase</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">the female yeah he&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.319" end="01:09:00.000" style="s2">basically a pole you know a static</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:02.239" style="s2">figure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.000" end="01:09:03.679" style="s2">showcasing all the things that she can</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.239" end="01:09:05.679" style="s2">do that&#39;s what makes a good</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.679" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">male dance partner i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.679" end="01:09:08.960" style="s2">things work as far as</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">you know how we&#39;re identifying and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.960" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">know on political roles these days</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:14.239" style="s2">however i think traditionally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">kind of how well i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.239" end="01:09:18.640" style="s2">beautiful aspect to this concept that</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:20.239" style="s2">healthy male female relations and</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.640" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">heterosexual context</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.239" end="01:09:24.239" style="s2">have to do with passing power back and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">forth and so the idea is that he might</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.239" end="01:09:28.080" style="s2">have the responsibility of leading</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">which people will say well that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.080" end="01:09:33.679" style="s2">impressive act but then if the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">no but it&#39;s not just that i&#39;m leading my</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.679" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">role</p>

<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">so for me to get around that was like</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.120" end="01:18:48.480" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">striking because at that time i was</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.480" end="01:18:51.679" style="s2">really starting to feel</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">you know my depression was coming in my</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.679" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2">panic was coming in</p>

<p begin="01:19:09.280" end="01:19:15.440" style="s2">i guess marketable enough to have me</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:17.440" style="s2">be a representative of their agency you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:20.840" style="s2">know in the form of a recording artist</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.440" end="01:19:23.040" style="s2">so i really started to have some really</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.840" end="01:19:25.760" style="s2">mind-bendingly rageful and</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.040" end="01:19:26.560" style="s2">you know things going on in my head and</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.760" end="01:19:28.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.560" end="01:19:29.760" style="s2">i noticed that there were some other</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.159" end="01:19:32.239" style="s2">artists</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.760" end="01:19:34.400" style="s2">quote-unquote white artists that were</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.239" end="01:19:36.640" style="s2">starting to experiment with rock</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.400" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">in the jazz lane they were getting jazz</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.640" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">record deals but they were</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.080" end="01:19:44.159" style="s2">working with rock concepts overtly</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:45.760" style="s2">questioning does jazz have to swing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.159" end="01:19:48.960" style="s2">things of that nature</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.760" end="01:19:51.840" style="s2">that me from the wynton marcellus</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.960" end="01:19:52.560" style="s2">purest background and aspiration i would</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.840" end="01:19:55.760" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.560" end="01:20:00.960" style="s2">question does jazz have to swing right</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.760" end="01:20:04.480" style="s2">so there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.960" end="01:20:06.000" style="s2">anger starting to build up from a couple</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.480" end="01:20:07.760" style="s2">of different places from</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:09.840" style="s2">you could say a political aspect and</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:11.600" style="s2">also from a personal aspect</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.840" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">because i&#39;m like i can&#39;t even get a</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.600" end="01:20:14.639" style="s2">record deal here like</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:16.239" style="s2">how good do i have to play what do i</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:18.880" style="s2">have to prove here and</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.239" end="01:20:21.199" style="s2">ultimately who are you guys to judge</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.880" end="01:20:22.719" style="s2">whether i&#39;m worthy of a record deal or</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.199" end="01:20:24.880" style="s2">you know i it kind of got into these</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.719" end="01:20:27.600" style="s2">kind of simplistic and</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.880" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">superficial angers diminish and this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.600" end="01:20:31.600" style="s2">one of the reasons to be blunt about it</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:33.040" style="s2">since i heard you play first i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.600" end="01:20:34.800" style="s2">know</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.199" end="01:20:40.639" style="s2">i&#39;ve often thought i have to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.719" end="01:20:42.000" style="s2">promoting this guy not because he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.639" end="01:20:43.760" style="s2">going to get famous on his own but</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.000" end="01:20:45.920" style="s2">because he shouldn&#39;t have to say</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.760" end="01:20:46.960" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t need it just doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:50.159" style="s2">to be said i</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.600" end="01:23:30.960" style="s2">i&#39;m about to do something amazing</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.840" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">in in in that sense if i did it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.960" end="01:23:34.960" style="s2">from a narcissistic standpoint eric it</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:34.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:38.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you remember this she</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.639" end="01:23:40.719" style="s2">came up to me and she said he was</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.159" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">absolutely right</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.719" end="01:23:45.360" style="s2">that that said um i just want to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:48.800" style="s2">clarify that because i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.360" end="01:23:50.800" style="s2">to create the impression of a naked</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.800" end="01:23:52.320" style="s2">narcissistic egotistical kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.800" end="01:23:53.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not my point</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.320" end="01:23:56.400" style="s2">you did say something like that but it</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.760" end="01:23:58.159" style="s2">was the feeling of it if i if for me</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.400" end="01:23:59.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just that she was ruining a</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.159" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">situation you&#39;ve got sam harris there</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.840" end="01:24:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people there</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:08.159" style="s2">and she&#39;s you know bringing a scenario</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.560" end="01:24:11.840" style="s2">that ultimately no one else</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.159" end="01:24:13.040" style="s2">was going to sort of deal with it and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.840" end="01:24:14.480" style="s2">actually she&#39;s making a choice for</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.040" end="01:24:15.760" style="s2">everybody and this is why you see this</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.480" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">so then i had to make a choice as well</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.760" end="01:24:17.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:20.239" style="s2">is the thing how often do you have a</p>

<p begin="01:24:20.239" end="01:24:25.679" style="s2">of an orchestra you know of 50 people</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.679" end="01:24:27.600" style="s2">because somebody&#39;s cell phone goes off</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.679" end="01:24:30.320" style="s2">right this is now a common feature we</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.600" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">don&#39;t make the room for</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.320" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">opening our hearts and i think to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.239" end="01:24:36.080" style="s2">blunt about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.600" end="01:24:37.600" style="s2">um i&#39;m sorry if i told the story in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.080" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">way that didn&#39;t convey it but what</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.600" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">what actually happened was that we all</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:44.159" style="s2">did have a communal experience that</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">we&#39;re still talking about you know and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.159" end="01:24:46.960" style="s2">i can tell you that there are small</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:48.480" style="s2">number of performances</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.960" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">the time i saw prince open for the</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.480" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">rolling stones uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:56.880" style="s2">the time that i saw a</p>

<p begin="01:25:03.040" end="01:25:06.159" style="s2">this is one of those</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:08.880" style="s2">that was one of those nights on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.159" end="01:25:12.000" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.880" end="01:25:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve come to understand over</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.000" end="01:25:18.239" style="s2">time what aspects</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.280" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">of my playing and also what aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.239" end="01:25:23.440" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:26.719" style="s2">personal behavior or presentation</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.440" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">have been detrimental to my</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.719" end="01:25:31.920" style="s2">progression in certain aspects of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:35.120" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.920" end="01:25:38.239" style="s2">so i also want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.120" end="01:25:42.239" style="s2">i bring in that aspect</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.239" end="01:25:45.280" style="s2">to because it&#39;s very immature also</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.239" end="01:25:46.800" style="s2">to come with a knights templar kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.280" end="01:25:49.760" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.800" end="01:25:52.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that and we&#39;ve heard that and</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.760" end="01:25:55.840" style="s2">that also is not brilliant because</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.719" end="01:25:59.040" style="s2">the fact of the matter is there are many</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.840" end="01:26:02.159" style="s2">reasons and many contributing factors</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.040" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">many dynamics that play into</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.159" end="01:26:05.679" style="s2">careers into</p>

<p begin="01:26:12.400" end="01:26:19.920" style="s2">over time i&#39;ve come to understand a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:23.520" style="s2">more about how energy works and how</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.920" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve been very good at transforming the</p>

<p begin="01:26:24.560" end="01:26:28.400" style="s2">and you know bringing people to these</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:31.840" style="s2">types of ecstasies</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.400" end="01:26:32.239" style="s2">however there was another aspect that i</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.840" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.239" end="01:26:36.639" style="s2">less concerned with now i think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:38.159" style="s2">because of the panic attacks and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.639" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">depression and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.159" end="01:26:41.920" style="s2">i was a lot less sensitive to it because</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">in the anger</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.920" end="01:26:48.320" style="s2">as well however as time has gone by</p>

<p begin="01:27:02.000" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">and bring it into the music in a</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.800" end="01:29:12.000" style="s2">so far as i can tell at the piano</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.480" end="01:29:14.800" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been pushing yourself farther</p>

<p begin="01:29:14.800" end="01:29:18.719" style="s2">i i love the fact that you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.800" end="01:29:21.199" style="s2">the recognition and that it&#39;s giving you</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.080" end="01:29:50.639" style="s2">going and you have to go through those</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.239" end="01:29:53.440" style="s2">periods where you&#39;ve got that anger and</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.639" end="01:29:54.159" style="s2">furor because that&#39;s what causes things</p>

<p begin="01:29:55.920" end="01:29:59.440" style="s2">the it&#39;s quite the paradox</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.440" end="01:30:01.760" style="s2">that i&#39;ll have to concede that that</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.440" end="01:30:05.679" style="s2">that&#39;s very true</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.760" end="01:30:09.360" style="s2">had i not been so angry had i</p>

<p begin="01:30:09.360" end="01:30:13.760" style="s2">would have never appealed to me because</p>

<p begin="01:30:17.280" end="01:30:24.000" style="s2">yeah i wouldn&#39;t have had that to express</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.719" end="01:30:25.600" style="s2">the lyrics of rock are</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.000" end="01:30:28.480" style="s2">very different from the lyrics that</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.600" end="01:30:31.040" style="s2">you&#39;ll find in a gershwin or a jazz tune</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.480" end="01:30:32.880" style="s2">and it was those lyrics that provided me</p>

<p begin="01:30:39.920" end="01:30:43.440" style="s2">right right right and and to your point</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.760" end="01:30:45.679" style="s2">about swing the word rock</p>

<p begin="01:30:45.679" end="01:30:49.760" style="s2">is a rocking motion it&#39;s a verb</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.520" end="01:30:52.239" style="s2">to rock where it&#39;s led zeppelin and it&#39;s</p>
