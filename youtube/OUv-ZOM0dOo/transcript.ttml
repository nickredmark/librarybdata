<p begin="00:01:44.550" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">in the decentralization of centralized</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:53.060" style="s2">industry space so he was on the founding</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">move in the space and then after</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">realizing that decentralizing industries</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:29.220" style="s2">with tech wasn&#39;t enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">build better systems by itself he kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.220" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">of retired when the Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:35.520" style="s2">join the team there became a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">Board of Trustees and spent a number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.520" end="00:02:40.500" style="s2">years studying complex systems already</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:44.940" style="s2">had a strong background in history and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.500" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">law and sci-fi and futurism philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.940" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">and it started really thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">do we build a viable future complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">systems started a project there called</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">game B which is if game a of current</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:01.770" style="s2">civilization model is end of life what</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">does game d look like and that&#39;s when he</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.770" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">and I met and started working in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:12.209" style="s2">space and so then when we started neural</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:13.860" style="s2">hacker I was actually delightedly</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.209" end="00:03:16.110" style="s2">surprised it was something he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.860" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">get into because he hadn&#39;t been working</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.110" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">in the medicine biotech space so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">we&#39;ll start there but first Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">thanks for being on the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:29.510" style="s2">yeah thanks Dana it&#39;s fun it&#39;s uh it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">amusing coming into the office and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.510" end="00:03:33.090" style="s2">knowing that you and I who actually been</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:35.489" style="s2">a lot of time talking to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.090" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">out talking to each other publicly in</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.489" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">this vehicle yeah and you&#39;re sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">the seat that I&#39;m normally sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">when recording these there&#39;s a sign</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">behind us okay so why did you why were</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.220" style="s2">you interested in getting involved with</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:53.850" style="s2">something that&#39;s working in the health</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.220" end="00:03:55.799" style="s2">wellness neuropsych medicine space at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.850" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">all because it&#39;s different enough than</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.799" end="00:04:02.510" style="s2">things like information tech why was why</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">does that seem like a meaningful thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.510" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">okay so you you mentioned the notion and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:09.810" style="s2">the distinction between game a and game</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:11.910" style="s2">B and I had spent a substantial amount</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.810" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">of time taking a look at both of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.910" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">things kind of from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">game design and incentive structures as</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:20.040" style="s2">you mentioned decentralized versus</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">centralized technology and how that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.040" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">changes people&#39;s behaviors and attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:28.669" style="s2">and decisions and capabilities but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:31.050" style="s2">became increasingly clear was that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.669" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">whether you&#39;re playing gaming or game B</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.050" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">you&#39;re playing these games with and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">hopefully four people and a sizable</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">amount of what actually happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:44.940" style="s2">game is a consequence of the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:49.050" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.940" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">our playing and the for example the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.050" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">level of well-being their level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:59.070" style="s2">capacity are they suffering are they in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">pain are they sick are they limited by</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.070" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">particular kinds of beliefs framework</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:08.940" style="s2">for ideas and so and then as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:12.900" style="s2">out game a is in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.940" end="00:05:15.630" style="s2">simultaneously designed to not have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.900" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">much dependence on the well-being</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.630" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">capacity of discrete individual humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:23.160" style="s2">it&#39;s you know the bureaucracy it&#39;s a fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:24.540" style="s2">into this particular Square and all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">rest of you can go away and as long as</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.540" end="00:05:28.530" style="s2">you could do your job okay it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:31.790" style="s2">alright we&#39;re it&#39;s game be as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.530" end="00:05:33.930" style="s2">out is substantially more dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.790" end="00:05:36.180" style="s2">what we&#39;ve called sovereignty the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.930" end="00:05:39.420" style="s2">sovereignty of the individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:41.730" style="s2">playing the game and then just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.420" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">go one more step I think largely as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.730" end="00:05:44.100" style="s2">consequence if the fact that game a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t care that much</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.100" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">I thought the well-being of individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">human beings were part of it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:54.660" style="s2">need them to be well-rounded and capable</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:56.190" style="s2">it also tends to produce quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.660" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">significant limitations and constraints</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.190" end="00:06:02.280" style="s2">in human capacity so we end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:03.750" style="s2">situation where even if were reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.280" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">effective in building out a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.750" end="00:06:08.970" style="s2">other elements of game be say for</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:10.919" style="s2">example an alternative economic model if</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.970" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">the human beings who are coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.919" end="00:06:16.260" style="s2">game Bay and game a sorry don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:19.650" style="s2">ability to play game B for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.260" end="00:06:22.530" style="s2">reason then it&#39;s a non-starter so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.650" end="00:06:24.150" style="s2">was the the impetus for me at least to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.530" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">begin looking in the space and then of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.150" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">course that&#39;s where you&#39;d spent the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:32.070" style="s2">substantial fraction of your life</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">so you said if the people don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.070" end="00:06:38.460" style="s2">have the well-being and the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:40.350" style="s2">okay those were kind of key terms to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.460" end="00:06:43.590" style="s2">able to play a different game and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.350" end="00:06:45.300" style="s2">in in game a people&#39;s ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.590" end="00:06:48.350" style="s2">productive within a narrow niche matters</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.300" end="00:06:52.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of all the matters their</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.350" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">ability to be a healthy whole sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.830" end="00:06:56.460" style="s2">outside of that narrow niche and since</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:58.689" style="s2">the narrow niche usually doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.460" end="00:07:01.389" style="s2">them self assessing what needs done</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.689" end="00:07:03.399" style="s2">out of the narrow boundaries we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.389" end="00:07:05.979" style="s2">actually squish people into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.399" end="00:07:11.139" style="s2">narrow AI is or robots right right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.979" end="00:07:12.309" style="s2">so this is very different I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.139" end="00:07:16.360" style="s2">almost like the intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.309" end="00:07:19.329" style="s2">Education and personal development and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.360" end="00:07:20.559" style="s2">health altogether right and well yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.329" end="00:07:22.119" style="s2">I think that&#39;s right I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.559" end="00:07:24.039" style="s2">funny in fact the fact that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.119" end="00:07:27.789" style="s2">partitioned those into three different</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.039" end="00:07:30.129" style="s2">domains is part of the problem so speak</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.789" end="00:07:31.599" style="s2">to the future of that why what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.129" end="00:07:32.979" style="s2">different than saying the future of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.599" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">medicine when we say the future of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.979" end="00:07:41.319" style="s2">well-being science okay so for reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:42.879" style="s2">think both good and bad for example and</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.319" end="00:07:47.379" style="s2">we can do this in education or personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.879" end="00:07:48.579" style="s2">development medicine has its innate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.379" end="00:07:50.469" style="s2">part of the analytical methodology right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.579" end="00:07:52.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s taken a whole bunch of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.469" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">decided this is not part of medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.360" end="00:07:57.459" style="s2">we just focus on these subdomains so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:01.089" style="s2">you know the health of the physical body</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.459" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">and in particular the lack of named</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.089" end="00:08:06.489" style="s2">sickness of the physical body is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:09.429" style="s2">domain under investigation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.489" end="00:08:10.959" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of major move number one and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.429" end="00:08:13.059" style="s2">I note by the way that psychiatry for</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.959" end="00:08:17.739" style="s2">example is a branch of medicine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.059" end="00:08:21.729" style="s2">takes into consideration the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.739" end="00:08:23.649" style="s2">certain kinds of named maladies in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.729" end="00:08:25.839" style="s2">mind but of course it also does it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.649" end="00:08:29.229" style="s2">through the channel of the body as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.839" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">primary mechanism and then intriguingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.229" end="00:08:34.209" style="s2">for reasons that we probably don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:36.729" style="s2">time to go into these kinds of moves in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.209" end="00:08:39.069" style="s2">game they also tend not only not only</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.729" end="00:08:41.110" style="s2">analytically narrowing to very specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.069" end="00:08:43.689" style="s2">prescribe domains they also tended to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.110" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">grab particular tools and use those</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.689" end="00:08:46.870" style="s2">tools to the exclusion of other tools so</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.430" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">what happens in medicine then is that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.870" end="00:08:53.079" style="s2">get a combination of a handful of tools</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:56.529" style="s2">that are diagnostic and a minute of in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.079" end="00:08:58.990" style="s2">nature pharmacology being a primary in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.529" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">surgery being another primary one that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">then what happens is you get this nice</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">trade-off that to the extent that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:09.309" style="s2">is a named problem in the body a disease</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:11.380" style="s2">for which these tools work medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.309" end="00:09:12.529" style="s2">check good to go and can generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.380" end="00:09:14.869" style="s2">actually provide pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.529" end="00:09:18.139" style="s2">Solutions but to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.869" end="00:09:19.669" style="s2">there is either a intradomain problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.139" end="00:09:22.909" style="s2">something that&#39;s happening between say</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.669" end="00:09:23.929" style="s2">medicine and education or trans domain</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.909" end="00:09:25.969" style="s2">problems something that doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.929" end="00:09:30.069" style="s2">currently have a domain at all to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.969" end="00:09:31.909" style="s2">subscribe to it or something that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.069" end="00:09:33.349" style="s2">characteristics that are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.909" end="00:09:35.449" style="s2">particularly amenable to these tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.349" end="00:09:38.689" style="s2">then we find ourselves in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.449" end="00:09:42.139" style="s2">where the the approach of contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.689" end="00:09:45.289" style="s2">medicine ends up being limited and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.139" end="00:09:47.749" style="s2">oftentimes even counterproductive and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.289" end="00:09:49.129" style="s2">you know we can unpack that and create</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.749" end="00:09:49.699" style="s2">examples of that sort of thing over and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.129" end="00:09:52.159" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.699" end="00:09:54.229" style="s2">I mean diabetes is a case that medicine</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.159" end="00:09:56.389" style="s2">itself has already identified within the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.229" end="00:09:58.579" style="s2">medical tool kit diabetes shows up first</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.389" end="00:10:00.499" style="s2">and foremost as something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.579" end="00:10:02.719" style="s2">resolved through the intervention of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.499" end="00:10:04.879" style="s2">insulin and at the medical level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.719" end="00:10:06.379" style="s2">actually pretty good solution but what</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.879" end="00:10:08.389" style="s2">we see of course is the diabetes is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.379" end="00:10:09.799" style="s2">complex phenomenon that includes</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.389" end="00:10:11.809" style="s2">everything from what kind of choices</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.799" end="00:10:14.449" style="s2">individuals make in what kinds of foods</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.809" end="00:10:17.389" style="s2">they eat what kinds of health and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.449" end="00:10:21.499" style="s2">fitness regimen sleep regimen what kinds</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.389" end="00:10:23.239" style="s2">of other kinds of behaviors that engage</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.499" end="00:10:26.449" style="s2">in who the social environment they put</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.239" end="00:10:28.009" style="s2">themselves in etc etc etc and all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.449" end="00:10:29.869" style="s2">these are problems the medicine has</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.009" end="00:10:32.119" style="s2">defined as out of scope out of domain</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.869" end="00:10:33.229" style="s2">and so then you might kick it up and say</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.119" end="00:10:35.089" style="s2">whether the health care industry</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.229" end="00:10:37.399" style="s2">noticeably rebranded its the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.089" end="00:10:40.269" style="s2">industry has endeavored to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.399" end="00:10:44.229" style="s2">how to address the larger combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.269" end="00:10:46.429" style="s2">of causes associated with diabetes and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.229" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">it&#39;s actually self-conscious of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.429" end="00:10:50.269" style="s2">that it is a rather poor job you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:52.939" style="s2">health behavior change is a thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.269" end="00:10:54.559" style="s2">been around now for decades and is more</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.939" end="00:10:58.039" style="s2">less identified in healthcare as just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.559" end="00:11:00.529" style="s2">hard problem that hasn&#39;t been solved</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.039" end="00:11:03.229" style="s2">particularly effectively and of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.529" end="00:11:04.639" style="s2">diabetes is a an easy one but there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.229" end="00:11:06.139" style="s2">much larger ones that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.639" end="00:11:07.909" style="s2">grab they&#39;re even less amenable to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.139" end="00:11:10.369" style="s2">medicine yet nonetheless are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.909" end="00:11:14.109" style="s2">fundamentally identified as things</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.369" end="00:11:18.259" style="s2">around well-being human capacity okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.109" end="00:11:22.159" style="s2">I&#39;m fishing here but why is behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.259" end="00:11:24.199" style="s2">change so hard when we look at a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.159" end="00:11:25.880" style="s2">picture say we take diabetes why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.199" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">behavior change</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.880" end="00:11:29.750" style="s2">off of eating too much sugar too many</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">carbohydrates not enough nutrient filled</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.750" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">food and exercise within our larger</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:34.820" style="s2">macro systems and not just within</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.470" style="s2">medicine but like everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.820" end="00:11:39.950" style="s2">conditioning that why is that so hard</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.470" end="00:11:41.030" style="s2">and a related question of you said we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.950" end="00:11:43.850" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have time to go into it fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.030" end="00:11:45.890" style="s2">but the medicine ends up narrowing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.850" end="00:11:47.840" style="s2">just having certain tools right so then</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.890" end="00:11:49.820" style="s2">why does it have these tools and not</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.840" end="00:11:52.220" style="s2">other tools obviously we&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.820" end="00:11:55.820" style="s2">like economics and you know incentive</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.220" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">and but that&#39;s worth speaking to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.820" end="00:12:00.050" style="s2">and then it actually harkens back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:01.940" style="s2">this notion of different games because</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.050" end="00:12:03.800" style="s2">at least part of the answer there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.940" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">different aspects to this question but</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.800" end="00:12:08.780" style="s2">at least part of the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:11.750" style="s2">identified by the name attractor or</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.780" end="00:12:13.520" style="s2">basin of Attraction so and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.750" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">gonna shift from medicine for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.520" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">so we can kind of see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:20.840" style="s2">perspective let&#39;s take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">education so it&#39;s you know relatively</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.840" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">well understood that the American</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:26.780" style="s2">educational system is has challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">one of the things that many people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.780" end="00:12:33.770" style="s2">try to do reforms in education notice is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:36.170" style="s2">that they have an experience a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.770" end="00:12:39.230" style="s2">bit like trying to push a heavy ball up</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.170" end="00:12:41.450" style="s2">a hill where they get it&#39;s a 3/4 of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.230" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">way up but then smoothing that goes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.450" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">ball rolls all the way back down hill</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.990" style="s2">and that the reason for that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:49.880" style="s2">actually a basin of Attraction of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.990" end="00:12:52.190" style="s2">of different kinds of forces for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.880" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2">in education you have the linkage</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.190" end="00:12:56.450" style="s2">between what&#39;s called credential ization</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:59.570" style="s2">let&#39;s just say for example you go to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.450" end="00:13:01.850" style="s2">school to get into college you go to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.570" end="00:13:03.020" style="s2">college to get a good degree you get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.850" end="00:13:05.030" style="s2">good degree which you say you get a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.020" end="00:13:07.130" style="s2">credential so that you can get a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.030" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">job she actually had this binding</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.130" end="00:13:11.090" style="s2">between the labor market and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">education market that actually makes it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.090" end="00:13:14.570" style="s2">so the things that you do in education</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">if they actually show up is not</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.840" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">then one isn&#39;t that a new place that new</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.070" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">place is in fact stable and it&#39;ll hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">in that location you&#39;re no longer</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">hill there&#39;s actually you know to kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.730" end="00:15:08.170" style="s2">of loop back why I moved from where I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">was into the domain of well-being which</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">was that I had identified that what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:12.790" style="s2">were actually making really good</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:16.450" style="s2">progress in places like say blotching in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.790" end="00:15:18.580" style="s2">moving economic systems and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.450" end="00:15:22.300" style="s2">decentralized media and software and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.580" end="00:15:23.500" style="s2">moving same media systems I have this</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.300" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the time aware of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.500" end="00:15:25.930" style="s2">was meaningfully being done in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:28.270" style="s2">intimated well-being</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.930" end="00:15:30.130" style="s2">and these things are all connected and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.270" end="00:15:32.350" style="s2">so we actually have to be really</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.130" end="00:15:34.060" style="s2">thinking about all of it at once and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.350" end="00:15:37.780" style="s2">they all fit together if we want to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.060" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">this transition from A to B happen okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.780" end="00:15:44.080" style="s2">so you hit on a really core topic that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:45.640" style="s2">just want to kind of highlight and for</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.080" end="00:15:48.040" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.640" end="00:15:51.570" style="s2">much it sounds profoundly cynical but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.040" end="00:15:51.570" style="s2">also is inescapable is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.640" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">from the business supply side addiction</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.450" end="00:16:00.190" style="s2">is profitable so if someone is addicted</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:01.810" style="s2">to the stuff that I sell I&#39;m gonna sell</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.190" end="00:16:04.769" style="s2">more of it than if they have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.810" end="00:16:07.089" style="s2">to say no and not take it often and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.769" end="00:16:09.670" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about food if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.089" end="00:16:11.560" style="s2">selling more addictive stuff then people</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.670" end="00:16:14.920" style="s2">are gonna eat it more often and if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.560" end="00:16:17.019" style="s2">make more money by how many times people</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.920" end="00:16:19.060" style="s2">buy my thing maximize lifetime revenue</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.019" end="00:16:21.160" style="s2">of a customer then I have a financial</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.060" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">incentive to optimize towards maximum</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.160" end="00:16:25.570" style="s2">addictiveness and so interestingly right</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:27.550" style="s2">where I&#39;m gonna figure out how to market</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.570" end="00:16:29.290" style="s2">in the most compelling way is because</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.550" end="00:16:30.820" style="s2">behavior change actually isn&#39;t hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.290" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">they&#39;re they were pretty good at getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.820" end="00:16:35.980" style="s2">people to eat the shitty food right</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:37.930" style="s2">right and then the the fun thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.980" end="00:16:40.630" style="s2">mean the fun terrible thing is then that</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.930" end="00:16:42.279" style="s2">actually predisposes them needing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.630" end="00:16:43.420" style="s2">medicine and the medicine companies also</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.279" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">make more money when you need more</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.420" end="00:16:48.010" style="s2">medicine and as the people get sicker</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:49.570" style="s2">from eating more food that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.010" end="00:16:53.589" style="s2">addicted to and then get addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.570" end="00:16:55.480" style="s2">meaning dependent upon the the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.589" end="00:16:56.980" style="s2">diabetes medicine or the statin or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.480" end="00:17:01.870" style="s2">whatever it is that came from that food</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.980" end="00:17:03.850" style="s2">GDP goes up in both cases right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.870" end="00:17:05.169" style="s2">think there&#39;s actually two or there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.850" end="00:17:08.500" style="s2">bunch of stuff in there but let me see</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.169" end="00:17:11.799" style="s2">if I can tease two things out so someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.500" end="00:17:14.439" style="s2">is the the fact that because of some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.799" end="00:17:20.949" style="s2">the kind of the deep characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.439" end="00:17:23.290" style="s2">gaming which one of my collaborators Jim</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.949" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">had identified as money on money return</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.290" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">and so if you look at game a the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:32.169" style="s2">primary way to win game a is to increase</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">the rate at which your money is making</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.169" end="00:17:41.940" style="s2">more money and I say that because if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">look at the kind of the slope of game a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.940" end="00:17:48.760" style="s2">over the past 50 years or so maybe 80</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:52.770" style="s2">years what you&#39;ll notice is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.760" end="00:17:55.270" style="s2">a gradual and continuous slide from</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:17:56.530" style="s2">towards that direction and so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.270" end="00:17:58.540" style="s2">for example to put a very poor exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.530" end="00:18:01.419" style="s2">in the beginning the rule might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.540" end="00:18:03.070" style="s2">something like do the right thing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.419" end="00:18:05.530" style="s2">then the second rule might be something</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.070" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">like make as much profit</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.530" end="00:18:09.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t but winds up happening is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:11.550" style="s2">somebody who plays by that rule compared</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.850" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">to somebody who say plays by the rule of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.550" end="00:18:16.630" style="s2">make as much profit as you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.200" end="00:18:19.420" style="s2">oh and also do the right thing all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.630" end="00:18:20.470" style="s2">that minor shift of orientation means</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.420" end="00:18:21.970" style="s2">that the person who plays with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.470" end="00:18:23.830" style="s2">second rule is going to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.970" end="00:18:25.690" style="s2">more money and by virtue of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.830" end="00:18:28.300" style="s2">is more likely to be able to say get</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.690" end="00:18:29.770" style="s2">more access more power they&#39;ll go up the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.300" end="00:18:30.820" style="s2">ladder they&#39;ll have more choice making</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.770" end="00:18:32.800" style="s2">and of course they&#39;ll have more money</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.820" end="00:18:37.540" style="s2">with which to make more investments but</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.800" end="00:18:40.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not a very long step from making as</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.540" end="00:18:42.520" style="s2">much profit as you can and try to do the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.270" end="00:18:47.170" style="s2">right thing to make as much profit as</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.520" end="00:18:48.460" style="s2">you can and say do it is legal that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.170" end="00:18:50.110" style="s2">actually a move that move actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.460" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">happened and then you got something on</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.110" end="00:18:54.550" style="s2">the lines of do it is arguably legal and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:57.910" style="s2">then it&#39;s not too far to say well do</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">what you can get away with then maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.910" end="00:19:04.030" style="s2">what you where getting caught is less</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.480" end="00:19:05.740" style="s2">expensive than not getting caught or</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.030" end="00:19:07.330" style="s2">more than profits you make by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.740" end="00:19:11.020" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re doing and then even to</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.330" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">the point of where the costs of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.020" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">bribery corruption greenwashing</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:20.050" style="s2">manipulation et cetera is less expensive</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:21.640" style="s2">than the benefits of playing the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.050" end="00:19:23.710" style="s2">way right and so it&#39;s like a it is in</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.640" end="00:19:25.450" style="s2">fact a race to the bottom at downward</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.710" end="00:19:27.580" style="s2">slope but the problem is that at each</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.450" end="00:19:29.560" style="s2">step the underlying intrinsics of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.580" end="00:19:31.960" style="s2">kinds of behaviors are rewarded in game</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.560" end="00:19:33.640" style="s2">a leads to movement down that slope</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.960" end="00:19:34.930" style="s2">being actually showing up as a winning</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.640" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">strategy and of course then we end up</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.930" end="00:19:39.190" style="s2">with what I think many of us observe</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">today where a person who runs a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.190" end="00:19:44.350" style="s2">pharmaceutical company who does not in</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:47.470" style="s2">fact jack up prices to the highest they</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.350" end="00:19:47.860" style="s2">can possibly get away with is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.470" end="00:19:51.250" style="s2">loser</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.860" end="00:19:52.390" style="s2">and will end up either being bought out</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.250" end="00:19:54.520" style="s2">by somebody who&#39;s playing more</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.390" end="00:19:57.160" style="s2">aggressively being thrown out by their</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.520" end="00:20:02.260" style="s2">shareholders or board directors etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.160" end="00:20:04.540" style="s2">and so this is a it&#39;s not a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.260" end="00:20:06.610" style="s2">characteristic of the way the human</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.540" end="00:20:10.030" style="s2">beings operate in the world but it turns</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.610" end="00:20:13.990" style="s2">out to have been one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.030" end="00:20:15.190" style="s2">characteristics of of game a which had</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.990" end="00:20:16.840" style="s2">lots of virtues we should be quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.190" end="00:20:19.150" style="s2">like the way the game was designed and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.840" end="00:20:22.660" style="s2">the fact that it ended up winning</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.150" end="00:20:24.130" style="s2">in the 20th century should have lots</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.660" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">lots of positives so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.130" end="00:20:27.850" style="s2">observing now is is not the game a was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:30.250" style="s2">sort of always a terrible thing rather</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.850" end="00:20:33.340" style="s2">that there&#39;s certain characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.250" end="00:20:35.980" style="s2">that style of play that ends up in a bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.340" end="00:20:38.020" style="s2">place and so now the effort to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.980" end="00:20:41.370" style="s2">is there how do we while we still have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.020" end="00:20:43.750" style="s2">reasonably safe place to do this in</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.370" end="00:20:44.950" style="s2">figure out how to actually transition to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.750" end="00:20:47.920" style="s2">some other kind of game which hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.950" end="00:20:49.540" style="s2">is in fact one that doesn&#39;t naturally</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.920" end="00:20:50.520" style="s2">end up in a bad place by doing what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.540" end="00:20:54.130" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.520" end="00:20:56.500" style="s2">ie we engineer the basis of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.130" end="00:20:59.710" style="s2">properly of the whole system dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.500" end="00:21:01.270" style="s2">upfront at least we endeavour to Detroit</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.710" end="00:21:04.300" style="s2">at least be mindful of it the thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.270" end="00:21:06.250" style="s2">of of what are the likely places where</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.300" end="00:21:09.180" style="s2">this thing ends up as it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.250" end="00:21:11.110" style="s2">maturity what are the the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.180" end="00:21:13.270" style="s2">characteristics of what winning players</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.110" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">look like for individuals and groups so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.270" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">that is actually called niche</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.210" end="00:21:20.050" style="s2">construction so we wouldn&#39;t in fact want</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:21.880" style="s2">to construct the niche so that as people</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.050" end="00:21:23.740" style="s2">in attempt to figure out how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.880" end="00:21:27.220" style="s2">best they can in that niche their</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.740" end="00:21:29.980" style="s2">choices their local choices will always</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.220" end="00:21:34.900" style="s2">tend to actually an heir to the global</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.980" end="00:21:38.410" style="s2">best answer so for anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.900" end="00:21:41.500" style="s2">listening to the podcast a lot you will</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.410" end="00:21:42.990" style="s2">hear that two of the three major areas</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.500" end="00:21:45.820" style="s2">that neural hacker</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.990" end="00:21:48.130" style="s2">focuses on in hoping to do things in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.820" end="00:21:49.930" style="s2">health and wellness space working to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.130" end="00:21:52.630" style="s2">things in health moment space it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.930" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be done in the primary medicine</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.630" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">space right now are one that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:21:59.470" style="s2">financial incentives in the current</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:02.940" style="s2">system are wrong and so he was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.470" end="00:22:08.620" style="s2">just speaking to that which is if</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.940" end="00:22:09.880" style="s2">someone who is preventing illness ends</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.620" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">up meaning that you don&#39;t sell your</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.880" end="00:22:15.580" style="s2">product and treating curing illness</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.930" end="00:22:17.350" style="s2">quickly means that you can only charge</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.580" end="00:22:19.240" style="s2">as much as you have for a short time but</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.350" end="00:22:20.860" style="s2">managing the symptoms of illness for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.240" end="00:22:23.680" style="s2">very long time is very profitable</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.860" end="00:22:26.860" style="s2">that&#39;s a perverse incentive system if</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.680" end="00:22:29.260" style="s2">treating the side effect of a drug that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.860" end="00:22:31.190" style="s2">you give someone involves them having to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.260" end="00:22:33.170" style="s2">buy another drug</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.190" end="00:22:36.530" style="s2">also make and it&#39;s called an upsell that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.170" end="00:22:38.870" style="s2">is also a problem so we focused on is</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.530" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">there a way that we can actually get out</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.870" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">of the financial incentive trap that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:46.190" style="s2">most of medicine research is in and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">also that the epistemology is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.190" end="00:22:52.070" style="s2">meaning it narrows too much let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.680" style="s2">this an Aimable disease and let&#39;s find</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.070" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">one synthetic molecule or you know one</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.680" end="00:22:57.920" style="s2">surgery that will be able to correct</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:23:00.170" style="s2">some symptomatic part of it as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.920" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">to looking at the more complex set of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.170" end="00:23:05.650" style="s2">dynamics and how can we work with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s generating them so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.650" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">just appreciating that as Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:11.900" style="s2">talking about this he&#39;s naming some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:14.840" style="s2">the core principles of what neural</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.900" end="00:23:16.520" style="s2">hackers endeavoring to do I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.840" end="00:23:18.950" style="s2">say when you said money on money return</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.520" end="00:23:22.100" style="s2">so that brings up the thought of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:25.400" style="s2">financial services and people start</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.100" end="00:23:27.560" style="s2">mistaking production and extraction as</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.400" end="00:23:30.500" style="s2">you know one of the dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.560" end="00:23:32.540" style="s2">financial services can not meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.500" end="00:23:33.830" style="s2">increase the production of the types of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:35.390" style="s2">goods and services that increase the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.830" end="00:23:38.150" style="s2">quality of life of everyone while still</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.390" end="00:23:40.220" style="s2">extracting a lot sure this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.150" end="00:23:41.480" style="s2">main things that has made blockchain so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.220" end="00:23:44.330" style="s2">exciting to so many people in the last</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.480" end="00:23:46.250" style="s2">few years is not just to decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.330" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">anything but largely to decentralize</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.250" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">financial services for this reason and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.790" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">so this is an area that you&#39;ve worked in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">a lot and you are also talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">do we get the incentive structures right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:24:03.260" style="s2">for things like diabetes I&#39;m curious as</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">you think about the role that things</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.260" end="00:24:07.040" style="s2">like blockchain could have in changing</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:09.260" style="s2">the financial structures and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.040" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">incentive structures in medicine health</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.260" end="00:24:14.720" style="s2">wellness education some thoughts to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:16.700" style="s2">share on that Wow okay so that&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.720" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">a lot you see there&#39;s a handful that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.700" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">can put put together that would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.520" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">interesting useful in this context so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.580" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">all right so this there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:31.370" style="s2">core characteristics of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:32.750" style="s2">finance in general and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.370" end="00:24:37.790" style="s2">actually interesting to drill down on</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.750" end="00:24:40.620" style="s2">that because money isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.790" end="00:24:43.410" style="s2">anywhere near as obvious or easy as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.620" end="00:24:44.730" style="s2">as people kind of think because around</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.410" end="00:24:46.830" style="s2">all the time that we think okay well</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.730" end="00:24:48.420" style="s2">money as a is an object used to be in</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.830" end="00:24:50.100" style="s2">fact a physical object like a coin or</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.420" end="00:24:52.380" style="s2">piece of paper that I get for doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.100" end="00:24:53.700" style="s2">stuff and I give to go have them do do</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.380" end="00:24:55.220" style="s2">stuff for me alright so okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.700" end="00:24:57.270" style="s2">prosaic it&#39;s simple it&#39;s well understood</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.220" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">but what&#39;s really interesting to think</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.270" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">about is that is that you know money</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:05.610" style="s2">represents the ability of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:07.530" style="s2">to abstract it represents the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.610" end="00:25:11.340" style="s2">take something which is a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.530" end="00:25:11.880" style="s2">something and replace it for the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.340" end="00:25:14.850" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.880" end="00:25:17.490" style="s2">alright so instead of having a an apple</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.850" end="00:25:20.510" style="s2">what I can do is I can have I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.490" end="00:25:23.280" style="s2">apples cost his day to two dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.510" end="00:25:25.950" style="s2">then that is two dollars represents an</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.280" end="00:25:29.100" style="s2">abstraction the potential for me to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.950" end="00:25:30.750" style="s2">an apple if and when I wanted every</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.100" end="00:25:33.390" style="s2">course is extraordinarily powerful which</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.750" end="00:25:34.500" style="s2">is what finance is about but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.390" end="00:25:36.210" style="s2">is is that you&#39;ve now got this</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.500" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">interesting gap you&#39;ve got the gap</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.210" end="00:25:40.650" style="s2">between the thing itself the value and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">the indicator the sign of the value and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.650" end="00:25:45.450" style="s2">what happens is that it&#39;s not long</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">before somebody realizes that you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.450" end="00:25:49.740" style="s2">actually make this show up like crazy</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:51.720" style="s2">without having any meaningful impact on</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.740" end="00:25:53.610" style="s2">this and that is what I would just</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.720" end="00:25:56.970" style="s2">characterize financial services as being</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.610" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">at the insight that if you&#39;re attempting</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.970" end="00:26:01.860" style="s2">to optimize for money completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:03.540" style="s2">regardless of the degree to which the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.860" end="00:26:04.950" style="s2">money is related at all to an</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.540" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">optimization of value I should point out</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:12.780" style="s2">amount of tomfoolery in economics where</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.920" end="00:26:17.059" style="s2">economics tells a story that there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.780" end="00:26:20.070" style="s2">something kind of a revocable about</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.059" end="00:26:22.500" style="s2">money and value that they are directly</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.070" end="00:26:23.550" style="s2">and always connected and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.500" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">important to recognize that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.550" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">the case so they can be and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:30.120" style="s2">why money is useful very useful but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:31.650" style="s2">also can be separated of course we see</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.120" end="00:26:33.720" style="s2">this for example just to the simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.650" end="00:26:35.370" style="s2">notion of debasing of currency if I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.720" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">counterfeit a bunch of money I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.370" end="00:26:38.970" style="s2">generated lots and lots and lots of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.840" end="00:26:40.890" style="s2">sign but I haven&#39;t generated the value</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.970" end="00:26:42.390" style="s2">and I think in many ways it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.890" end="00:26:44.309" style="s2">happening is the financial services ends</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.390" end="00:26:47.250" style="s2">up showing a whole outlaw showing up a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.309" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">whole lot like counterfeiting now they</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.250" end="00:26:51.060" style="s2">produce lots and lots of things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:55.350" style="s2">generate lots of valid signs lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.060" end="00:26:58.360" style="s2">money but in fact little or no value</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.350" end="00:27:02.070" style="s2">in spite of the the protestations the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.360" end="00:27:02.070" style="s2">economic profession now</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.060" end="00:27:08.050" style="s2">another piece and I mmm tripe stew to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.980" end="00:27:10.290" style="s2">to pieces and they shift Dubois changes</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.050" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">to create the kind of parallax effect is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.290" end="00:27:15.280" style="s2">that another thing that happens with</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">money is that in money is an allocation</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.280" end="00:27:20.860" style="s2">that&#39;s the kinds of choice making that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:22.630" style="s2">we&#39;re investing in in our economy so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.860" end="00:27:25.030" style="s2">should just say that every dollar you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.630" end="00:27:27.580" style="s2">have is in many ways a vote in what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.030" end="00:27:30.160" style="s2">economy does all right so if I really</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.580" end="00:27:31.870" style="s2">really want to have nothing but red</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.160" end="00:27:35.620" style="s2">Ferraris and you really want to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.870" end="00:27:37.420" style="s2">nothing but say corn and I have all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.620" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">money then the economy is going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.420" end="00:27:41.560" style="s2">produce red Ferraris and not corn and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">what ends up happening is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.560" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">way that finance allocates money also it</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:49.240" style="s2">shows up as a way that our society</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:53.170" style="s2">allocates choice making at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.240" end="00:27:55.060" style="s2">economic domain and different there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.170" end="00:27:58.990" style="s2">specific reason to believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.060" end="00:28:00.970" style="s2">people who are most capable of playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.990" end="00:28:02.980" style="s2">the game of finance are also the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.970" end="00:28:04.690" style="s2">capable of making good choices in what</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.980" end="00:28:06.040" style="s2">the economy should be produced and in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.690" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">fact there&#39;s very good reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.040" end="00:28:11.170" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case now shifting over to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:13.060" style="s2">blockchain think about what what those</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.170" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">two characteristics that I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.060" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">articulated show up and blockchain and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:19.150" style="s2">then we&#39;ll kind of move to the third</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:21.880" style="s2">which is I think the most important on</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.150" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">the one hand because blockchain is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.880" end="00:28:24.910" style="s2">kind of thing that actually doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">a whole lot of sense to people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.910" end="00:28:30.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t done things like study</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.520" end="00:28:33.670" style="s2">cryptography or have a deep deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.760" end="00:28:34.870" style="s2">of technology and technology trends the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.670" end="00:28:36.820" style="s2">people who showed up as being the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.870" end="00:28:39.220" style="s2">earliest winners in the blockchain space</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">are a different population than the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.220" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">people who have been winning the finance</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">game for the last 80 years so now of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">course the finance folks are scrambling</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:49.150" style="s2">like crazy to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:50.890" style="s2">reestablish their dominance in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.150" end="00:28:52.930" style="s2">blockchain space but at least right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.890" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">even though blockchain is unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.930" end="00:28:56.770" style="s2">rather characterized by concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">wealth it&#39;s also characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">concentrated wealth from the hands of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:03.130" style="s2">different set of choice majors who at</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.730" end="00:29:07.540" style="s2">least so far have a higher degree of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.130" end="00:29:11.560" style="s2">capacity to perceive real problems and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.540" end="00:29:14.950" style="s2">compose real solutions to put it a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.560" end="00:29:16.810" style="s2">little bit prejudicially these are the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.950" end="00:29:18.970" style="s2">engineers from the movie Apollo 13 who</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.810" end="00:29:20.020" style="s2">know to solve problems and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.970" end="00:29:21.370" style="s2">actually a much better place to put your</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.020" end="00:29:23.050" style="s2">choice making than in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.370" end="00:29:26.770" style="s2">people who&#39;ve optimized for manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.050" end="00:29:29.620" style="s2">and counterfeiting money and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.770" end="00:29:32.560" style="s2">secondarily there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.620" end="00:29:34.810" style="s2">between money as we currently understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.560" end="00:29:37.330" style="s2">it and the the way that the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.810" end="00:29:39.280" style="s2">shows up that I actually remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.330" end="00:29:41.410" style="s2">thinking way back when it was first</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.280" end="00:29:42.970" style="s2">starting there was a quote that I read</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.410" end="00:29:45.580" style="s2">about from a Roman Emperor who was</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.970" end="00:29:48.430" style="s2">telling his son why was okay for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.580" end="00:29:52.450" style="s2">emperor to take taxes from the the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.430" end="00:29:55.270" style="s2">the people who did sanitation sewage and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.450" end="00:29:57.250" style="s2">he said gold hath no smell meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.270" end="00:30:00.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no choice ability to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.250" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">not any real direct connection between</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.120" end="00:30:05.500" style="s2">fiat currency and records and of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.180" style="s2">what it does is it creates a great niche</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.500" end="00:30:09.280" style="s2">for for exploiting that fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.180" end="00:30:10.360" style="s2">all right so if person a shows up with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.280" end="00:30:11.830" style="s2">million dollars in their pocket and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.360" end="00:30:15.040" style="s2">person B shows up with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.830" end="00:30:17.020" style="s2">thousand dollars in their pocket person</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.040" end="00:30:19.000" style="s2">a gets a much more power in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.020" end="00:30:20.650" style="s2">than person B in spite of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.000" end="00:30:21.970" style="s2">person a maybe for example or criminal</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.650" end="00:30:23.260" style="s2">alright somebody who stole that money</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.970" end="00:30:26.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know it has no smell</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.260" end="00:30:28.810" style="s2">you has no village of trace where as</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.200" end="00:30:30.520" style="s2">blockchain in fact is all about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.810" end="00:30:32.440" style="s2">durable records you know it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.520" end="00:30:35.650" style="s2">the whole point is that is a ledger</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.440" end="00:30:38.130" style="s2">decentralized ledger that is as</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.650" end="00:30:41.620" style="s2">resilient as we can currently conceived</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.130" end="00:30:43.600" style="s2">against modifications of the records</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.620" end="00:30:45.340" style="s2">themselves and this I think is both true</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.600" end="00:30:47.110" style="s2">to technical level added an ethos level</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.340" end="00:30:49.270" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about the ethos of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.110" end="00:30:52.030" style="s2">the blockchain community that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.270" end="00:30:54.340" style="s2">about keeping good records as being</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.030" end="00:30:55.990" style="s2">important oh by the way to be sure a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.340" end="00:30:57.910" style="s2">large number of folks in the blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.990" end="00:31:00.040" style="s2">community also very very much want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.910" end="00:31:02.920" style="s2">off and particularly the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.040" end="00:31:05.140" style="s2">radar but I think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.920" end="00:31:07.290" style="s2">subsidiary to the underlying foundation</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.140" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">of the technology that it actually does</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.290" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2">enable us to have more I think Dan</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.190" end="00:31:15.700" style="s2">Jeffery is actually a really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:17.980" style="s2">blog post about the the blockchain and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.700" end="00:31:19.900" style="s2">as being the emergence of the third</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.980" end="00:31:22.270" style="s2">major new immersion to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.900" end="00:31:24.550" style="s2">which it calls triple ledger accounting</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.270" end="00:31:30.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually worth deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.550" end="00:31:34.540" style="s2">looking into so so then you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.100" end="00:31:35.950" style="s2">last piece which is frankly I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.540" end="00:31:37.510" style="s2">right now still very esoteric but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.950" end="00:31:39.850" style="s2">think worth trying to scratch the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.510" end="00:31:43.300" style="s2">surface on which has to do with the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.850" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">that the blockchain enables us to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.300" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">money as a variable in a software system</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:53.700" style="s2">s code and what that does is allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.440" end="00:31:56.200" style="s2">actually be thoughtful about designing</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.700" end="00:31:58.300" style="s2">motivational and by the way game</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.200" end="00:32:00.580" style="s2">theoretic choice making infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.300" end="00:32:02.200" style="s2">so as to solve this problem we talked</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.580" end="00:32:04.630" style="s2">about earlier the problem how do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.200" end="00:32:06.400" style="s2">actually move high variable complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.630" end="00:32:09.520" style="s2">systems from one basin of Attraction</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.400" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">into another basin retraction and we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.520" end="00:32:11.890" style="s2">actually do this right now with a very</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:14.620" style="s2">simple example which is Bitcoin itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.890" end="00:32:18.730" style="s2">right as the first major instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.620" end="00:32:21.490" style="s2">of blockchain Bitcoin was able to solve</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.730" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">a problem that up until that point had</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.490" end="00:32:24.610" style="s2">been completely unsolved so you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">imagine for example let&#39;s say PayPal</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.610" end="00:32:29.650" style="s2">PayPal was a pretty successful company</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:31.179" style="s2">and it had if you look at the roster of</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.179" end="00:32:35.710" style="s2">there may not be a better pedigree I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:38.650" style="s2">mean in terms of the scope of what</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:40.780" style="s2">PayPal endeavoured to do in their case</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.650" end="00:32:44.350" style="s2">was to create a new form of money or</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.780" end="00:32:45.429" style="s2">digital money it still has not yet done</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.350" end="00:32:48.280" style="s2">anything other than what you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.429" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">consider to be failed so PayPal had some</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.280" end="00:32:53.590" style="s2">of the best people civilization could</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:57.280" style="s2">muster at a pretty good timing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.590" end="00:32:59.710" style="s2">failed whereas as Bitcoin more or less</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.280" end="00:33:03.190" style="s2">designed by say three or four people in</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.710" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">its original state seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.190" end="00:33:07.450" style="s2">succeeded there is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:09.400" style="s2">accelerating community of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.450" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2">using this thing and constantly solving</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.400" end="00:33:12.790" style="s2">problems and fixing and building it out</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.600" end="00:33:13.750" style="s2">and the way they did that was my</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.790" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">understanding that they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.750" end="00:33:18.280" style="s2">dealing with a complex system and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:21.040" style="s2">they designed a technical architecture</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.280" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">that had a motivational infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.040" end="00:33:25.990" style="s2">so that individuals coming from wherever</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:28.810" style="s2">they came from would look at it choose</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.990" end="00:33:30.980" style="s2">as individuals to make choices that were</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.810" end="00:33:32.870" style="s2">in their best interests because</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.980" end="00:33:35.210" style="s2">the way the system was designed those</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.870" end="00:33:37.220" style="s2">individual local choices would always</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.210" end="00:33:40.690" style="s2">aggregate to something that is in the</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.690" end="00:33:47.000" style="s2">and I mean we can double click on that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.169" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">try to get some more detail but I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.000" end="00:33:50.929" style="s2">now&#39;s a good time to pause but the point</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:55.669" style="s2">is that that&#39;s an example of how this</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.929" end="00:33:56.600" style="s2">new kind of fiscal software I think some</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.669" end="00:33:59.480" style="s2">the folks of the beer coming up</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.600" end="00:34:01.220" style="s2">socio-technical platforms actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.480" end="00:34:03.950" style="s2">enables us to crack the code on</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.220" end="00:34:05.750" style="s2">designing complex systems to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:08.690" style="s2">able to move things out of basins of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.750" end="00:34:13.190" style="s2">attraction into hopefully higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.690" end="00:34:15.200" style="s2">of overall capacity right so with</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.190" end="00:34:21.109" style="s2">blockchain 2 of the really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">things are the uncorruptible or harder</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.109" end="00:34:25.369" style="s2">to corrupt ledger but then also the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:27.260" style="s2">crypto economics and those are two</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.369" end="00:34:30.830" style="s2">different things the crypto economics is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.260" end="00:34:33.470" style="s2">the ability to have a more nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.830" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">complex incentive structure because</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.470" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">rather than just dollars that are going</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:41.690" style="s2">to be associated kind of the same across</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:43.609" style="s2">the whole market as a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.690" end="00:34:45.980" style="s2">incentive you can have different types</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.609" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">of tokens for different types of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.980" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">and etc so if we relate this back to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.010" style="s2">some of the issues we were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:57.050" style="s2">with the financial incentive that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.010" end="00:34:58.580" style="s2">know went down the game theoretic Hill</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.050" end="00:35:00.850" style="s2">that you were talking about that started</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.580" end="00:35:03.470" style="s2">with do good things and be profitable to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.850" end="00:35:09.530" style="s2">be profitable and maybe do good things</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.470" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">to get away with it how could this type</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.530" end="00:35:16.490" style="s2">of crypto economic dynamic play out in</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:18.950" style="s2">say Pharma or in hospitals or in citizen</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.490" end="00:35:21.260" style="s2">science or anything like that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.950" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">that could actually change the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.260" end="00:35:25.580" style="s2">motivational dynamics that would lead to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:27.530" style="s2">better healthcare right so as as you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.580" end="00:35:29.840" style="s2">know there was an announcement I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.530" end="00:35:32.180" style="s2">today it may have been yesterday where</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.840" end="00:35:33.950" style="s2">some hospitals are proposing that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.180" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">may begin the process of endeavor decree</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.950" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">an alternative scientific and economic</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">model for producing pharmaceuticals and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.340" style="s2">this is a response to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">pharmaceuticals are</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.340" end="00:35:50.840" style="s2">Oh too expensive so and I think actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:52.280" style="s2">the technology the blockchain technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.840" end="00:35:53.960" style="s2">and the concept of a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.280" end="00:35:55.850" style="s2">autonomous organization is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.960" end="00:35:58.760" style="s2">exactly the right solution to this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.850" end="00:36:00.230" style="s2">problem and in fact if I configure it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.760" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">with a message just the hospitals are</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.230" end="00:36:04.370" style="s2">doing it this would maybe be the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:06.200" style="s2">thing they could possibly do so first I</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.370" end="00:36:07.700" style="s2">mean shift a little bit to the software</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.200" end="00:36:09.080" style="s2">domain and then come back to the pharma</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.700" end="00:36:10.220" style="s2">domain because I know the software</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.080" end="00:36:12.440" style="s2">domain better but it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:14.900" style="s2">direct mapping so one of the things for</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.440" end="00:36:16.850" style="s2">example that you&#39;ll see in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.900" end="00:36:18.790" style="s2">blockchain core blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.850" end="00:36:22.040" style="s2">infrastructure players called etherium</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.790" end="00:36:23.960" style="s2">is that in etherium what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.040" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">actually created their own private</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.960" end="00:36:28.760" style="s2">software language called solidity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.500" style="s2">kind of like JavaScript or C or C++</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.760" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s a language that software</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.500" end="00:36:34.490" style="s2">guys can write in and what they write</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.180" end="00:36:36.170" style="s2">will show up as something that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.490" end="00:36:40.730" style="s2">etherium system knows how to understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.170" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">and can do things with now all code</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.730" end="00:36:47.480" style="s2">written in etherium is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">intrinsically open source meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.480" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">if I write a very powerful object in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">aetherium you can&#39;t actually write</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.750" style="s2">something which calls that object for</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.430" end="00:36:58.250" style="s2">free it&#39;s just there now of course I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.750" end="00:37:00.260" style="s2">make it not for free but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.250" end="00:37:02.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s in the system so it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.260" end="00:37:05.570" style="s2">happening is you get this process where</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.120" end="00:37:08.120" style="s2">as more and more core infrastructure is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.570" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">built and made available the next layer</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.690" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">core infrastructure to get to work on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.010" end="00:37:17.270" style="s2">top of that core infrastructure in fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.490" style="s2">where the primary problem is is finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.270" end="00:37:22.490" style="s2">the tools that you need out of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.490" end="00:37:24.110" style="s2">giant increasingly large pool of tools</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.110" end="00:37:27.470" style="s2">you want to solve but this is very Rama</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.880" end="00:37:28.730" style="s2">flying right the idea of standing on the</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.730" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.360" end="00:37:33.620" style="s2">when it&#39;s all sitting there as software</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:35.000" style="s2">all sitting in a blockchain registry</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.620" end="00:37:37.250" style="s2">which means that all the records are</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.000" end="00:37:39.590" style="s2">well kept and the path of who did what</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.250" end="00:37:41.330" style="s2">is actually fully traceable so you know</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.510" end="00:38:51.240" style="s2">it so it looks good and then hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:52.290" style="s2">get into a journal you can actually just</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.240" end="00:38:54.990" style="s2">have them be in an open environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.290" end="00:38:58.380" style="s2">because the people who are doing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.990" end="00:38:59.970" style="s2">work have an incentive that is not tied</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.380" end="00:39:01.079" style="s2">to for example publish or perish or have</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.970" end="00:39:02.670" style="s2">an incentive that is not tied to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.079" end="00:39:04.890" style="s2">creating patents but they have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.670" end="00:39:07.790" style="s2">incentive to moving forward the state of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.890" end="00:39:10.200" style="s2">the art in science and you can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.790" end="00:39:14.220" style="s2">neat little aetherium contracts that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.200" end="00:39:16.230" style="s2">actually reward people for say very high</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.230" end="00:39:19.770" style="s2">a high quality framework and put bam be</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.990" end="00:39:27.390" style="s2">generated and of course the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">happens for data you know if I come in</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.390" end="00:39:30.690" style="s2">and I&#39;m saying hey well I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:31.890" style="s2">contribute meaningfully to the science I</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.690" end="00:39:33.480" style="s2">can&#39;t come to me immediately to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.890" end="00:39:34.920" style="s2">software but I can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.480" end="00:39:37.950" style="s2">experimental protocols I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.920" end="00:39:40.230" style="s2">submit myself and put my data into this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.950" end="00:39:42.210" style="s2">large school and maybe what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:46.349" style="s2">was just a Senate for a sleep study and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.210" end="00:39:47.640" style="s2">so I I wear a or ring and I have an app</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.349" end="00:39:50.609" style="s2">and it&#39;s tracking my sleep and I just</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.640" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">every day submit some additional data</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.609" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">and the key is that my data gets put</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:55.740" style="s2">into this shared database and all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">variables associate with my data are now</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.740" end="00:39:59.579" style="s2">available for other people to research</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.300" end="00:40:01.319" style="s2">and I&#39;m also in a pool so I get a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.579" end="00:40:02.700" style="s2">message okay would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.319" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">participate in this particular sleep</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:06.420" style="s2">study for this particular practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:08.140" style="s2">here&#39;s the reward and we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.420" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">researched your data to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.140" end="00:40:11.740" style="s2">you already qualified for our protocol</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.000" style="s2">the protocol literally in software has</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.740" end="00:40:14.140" style="s2">the ability to make a ping out to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.000" end="00:40:16.120" style="s2">database to identify particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.140" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">individuals and make the offer on its</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.120" end="00:40:18.820" style="s2">own it&#39;s kind of like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.010" style="s2">thinking that&#39;s going on in the IOT</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:30.370" style="s2">gonna end up happening then as you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.230" end="00:40:33.250" style="s2">a an increasingly autocatalytic and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.370" end="00:40:34.990" style="s2">increasingly architecture based meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.250" end="00:40:37.030" style="s2">that most of the hard work has already</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.990" end="00:40:39.700" style="s2">been built as a platform that people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.030" end="00:40:41.230" style="s2">just access a resource and all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.700" end="00:40:43.780" style="s2">innovation work is actually be done at</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.230" end="00:40:46.540" style="s2">the surface of the sphere and as we know</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.780" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">the volume of the sphere increases to</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.540" end="00:40:50.200" style="s2">the cube all right so you actually got</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:51.880" style="s2">massive return on the investment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.200" end="00:40:53.860" style="s2">being done at the outside so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.880" end="00:40:55.210" style="s2">having lots and lots of little spheres</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.860" end="00:40:56.830" style="s2">that are all sort of communicating with</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.210" end="00:40:59.130" style="s2">each other over the market everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.830" end="00:41:01.330" style="s2">happening on the inside of that sphere</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.130" end="00:41:03.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve set all the values happening inside</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.330" end="00:41:05.050" style="s2">of the sphere that&#39;s being shared as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.070" end="00:41:08.650" style="s2">commons resource out into the broader</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.050" end="00:41:10.780" style="s2">population that&#39;s the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.650" end="00:41:12.940" style="s2">I think is frankly well within the scope</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.780" end="00:41:15.220" style="s2">of do ability now and they would take</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.940" end="00:41:16.420" style="s2">meaningful effort but if you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.220" end="00:41:18.390" style="s2">at the size of the amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.420" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s currently being frankly wasted in</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.390" end="00:41:24.820" style="s2">the interface between hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:26.590" style="s2">pharma you know on the order to say god</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.820" end="00:41:27.610" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t even be that much you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.590" end="00:41:29.950" style="s2">know the order of hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.610" end="00:41:31.660" style="s2">of dollars a year would be vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.950" end="00:41:32.680" style="s2">than enough to completely resource the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.660" end="00:41:35.860" style="s2">infrastructure that I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.680" end="00:41:37.870" style="s2">and almost immediately frankly you&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.860" end="00:41:40.900" style="s2">some returns in three or four years you</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.870" end="00:41:42.570" style="s2">could probably be replacing twenty or</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.900" end="00:41:45.820" style="s2">thirty percent of what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.570" end="00:41:47.230" style="s2">pharma and in seven years will end up</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.820" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">happening actually is that you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.230" end="00:41:53.230" style="s2">shifting you know basically be</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:55.150" style="s2">decoupling financial services from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.230" end="00:41:57.460" style="s2">science of medicine and so it&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.150" end="00:41:59.890" style="s2">happening is that the scientists will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.460" end="00:42:01.150" style="s2">radically liberated to focus on what</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.890" end="00:42:02.260" style="s2">they do and by the way the engineers and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">technologists too because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.260" end="00:42:05.950" style="s2">obviously a lot of building of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:08.530" style="s2">instruments in tech this fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.950" end="00:42:11.500" style="s2">required to do this but the resource</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.530" end="00:42:12.700" style="s2">flow will no longer be gated by what</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.500" end="00:42:14.860" style="s2">would effectively as a gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.700" end="00:42:16.630" style="s2">financial services business sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.860" end="00:42:20.830" style="s2">top of which should in fact be a science</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.630" end="00:42:21.580" style="s2">and technology project so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.830" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">the key</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.580" end="00:42:26.650" style="s2">thing that you shared in there is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:28.390" style="s2">increase in sharing and transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.650" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">thus collaboration and thus collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.390" end="00:42:32.560" style="s2">intelligence and collective capacity</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:36.040" style="s2">where the current incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.560" end="00:42:37.720" style="s2">incentivizes owning and hoarding IP and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.040" end="00:42:40.030" style="s2">making sure nobody else uses the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.720" end="00:42:43.270" style="s2">that you discovered because you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.030" end="00:42:45.550" style="s2">make your money on patents and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.270" end="00:42:46.870" style="s2">sharing what you&#39;re learning until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.550" end="00:42:49.390" style="s2">published because the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.870" end="00:42:50.980" style="s2">published know that really what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.390" end="00:42:53.830" style="s2">talking about is the ability to change</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.980" end="00:42:55.960" style="s2">the information ecology the incentives</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.830" end="00:42:58.750" style="s2">that change the information ecology from</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.960" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">ones that incentivize hoarding</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.750" end="00:43:03.250" style="s2">information and making it hard for other</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.020" end="00:43:05.590" style="s2">people to use they have to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.250" end="00:43:07.450" style="s2">license and even dis informing - one</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.590" end="00:43:09.340" style="s2">that maximizes informing sharing</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.450" end="00:43:11.230" style="s2">collaborations yeah so and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.340" end="00:43:12.550" style="s2">there&#39;s actually two key pieces to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.230" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">the first we talked about a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.550" end="00:43:17.290" style="s2">which is the ability to keep records or</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:18.820" style="s2">as our friend Michael Bastyr talks about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.290" end="00:43:23.620" style="s2">it the ability to actually deliver</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.820" end="00:43:25.330" style="s2">justice which he defines as making sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.620" end="00:43:28.270" style="s2">that the loops are closed the value</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:30.730" style="s2">created needs to be value returned and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.270" end="00:43:32.230" style="s2">that externalities need to be returned</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.730" end="00:43:34.360" style="s2">to the critters of externalities right</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.230" end="00:43:36.040" style="s2">and if you have injustice if you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.360" end="00:43:37.750" style="s2">bad records in a system if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.040" end="00:43:39.460" style="s2">have the ability to determine who</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.750" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">created how much value and who created</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.460" end="00:43:43.390" style="s2">how much externality and thereby return</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:45.070" style="s2">it then you get a system that the drifts</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.390" end="00:43:48.390" style="s2">quite rapidly I mean where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.070" end="00:43:51.610" style="s2">strategies are about stealing credit and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.390" end="00:43:53.110" style="s2">avoiding responsibility so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.610" end="00:43:55.180" style="s2">piece or so one piece is just radically</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.110" end="00:43:56.200" style="s2">increasing the quality of the records</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.180" end="00:43:57.790" style="s2">that are being kept and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.200" end="00:44:00.220" style="s2">closing more and more loops which is say</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.790" end="00:44:02.230" style="s2">creating more and more justice and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.220" end="00:44:04.630" style="s2">the other side of the equation actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.230" end="00:44:06.460" style="s2">has to go to stuff like as you say more</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.630" end="00:44:08.620" style="s2">justice you also mean more incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.460" end="00:44:09.370" style="s2">actually do the right things rather than</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.620" end="00:44:11.020" style="s2">the wrong things</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.370" end="00:44:12.190" style="s2">yeah and intrinsically it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.020" end="00:44:18.300" style="s2">simply that&#39;s not it&#39;s not that people</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.190" end="00:44:21.850" style="s2">have to become sort of more pro bono</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.300" end="00:44:24.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just that the good things they do</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.850" end="00:44:25.870" style="s2">will be noticed and rewarded and the bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.130" end="00:44:28.330" style="s2">things they do will be noticed and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.870" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">punished done right it&#39;s pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.330" end="00:44:31.480" style="s2">like that&#39;s straightforward as long as</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:33.430" style="s2">you can provide that framework where</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.480" end="00:44:34.710" style="s2">people have clean boundaries and good</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.430" end="00:44:36.300" style="s2">choices or rewarding bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.710" end="00:44:37.980" style="s2">choices are punished they will begin to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.300" end="00:44:41.609" style="s2">move in that direction the beginning to</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.609" end="00:44:46.230" style="s2">has to do with the notion of the theory</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.230" end="00:44:52.349" style="s2">of the firm so you and I&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.869" end="00:44:55.050" style="s2">benefit of having Michael Vassar spend a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.349" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">lot of time explaining this model to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.050" end="00:45:01.410" style="s2">I think a lot of people think that what</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:03.960" style="s2">that markets do what you just said that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.410" end="00:45:06.510" style="s2">we live within capitalism capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.960" end="00:45:09.660" style="s2">based on market theory and the markets</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.510" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">are supposed to reward the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.660" end="00:45:14.369" style="s2">are good and not reward the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.380" style="s2">are bad and therefore you get a natural</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.369" end="00:45:18.300" style="s2">evolutionary dynamics of good stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.380" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like how evolution itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.300" end="00:45:21.960" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:23.339" style="s2">sure well why is that not true so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.960" end="00:45:25.380" style="s2">just assume that someone&#39;s listening to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.339" end="00:45:27.800" style="s2">this thinking that markets already do</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.380" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">that why is that not currently the case</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.800" end="00:45:31.859" style="s2">well I think a big part of it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:32.190" style="s2">with this is this notion of gold has no</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.859" end="00:45:35.730" style="s2">smell</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.190" end="00:45:39.119" style="s2">meaning that again you know person a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.730" end="00:45:40.950" style="s2">shows up in the in the market with ten</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.119" end="00:45:43.800" style="s2">apples and person B shows up in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.950" end="00:45:45.570" style="s2">market with five apples the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.800" end="00:45:47.490" style="s2">person a stole those apples from person</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.570" end="00:45:49.500" style="s2">B is since of the market in may have no</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.490" end="00:45:50.490" style="s2">capacity to perceive at all and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.500" end="00:45:52.109" style="s2">we don&#39;t even think about that as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.490" end="00:45:53.849" style="s2">market transaction that&#39;s called justice</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.109" end="00:45:55.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened so what we says</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.849" end="00:45:58.770" style="s2">okay well person B then needs to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.410" end="00:45:59.970" style="s2">some way to sue or otherwise rebalance</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.770" end="00:46:01.650" style="s2">the underlying infrastructure so we</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.970" end="00:46:03.990" style="s2">would think about then is that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.650" end="00:46:06.300" style="s2">market is consisting of a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.990" end="00:46:09.320" style="s2">little circles that are communicating</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.300" end="00:46:11.640" style="s2">with each other through transactions and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.320" end="00:46:14.609" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually have any information</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.640" end="00:46:17.010" style="s2">outside of that information flow so it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.609" end="00:46:18.210" style="s2">has in an inability to perceive all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.010" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">different ways that somebody might</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.210" end="00:46:23.880" style="s2">actually falsify the stuff that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:26.550" style="s2">market actually needs to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.880" end="00:46:28.530" style="s2">good choices meaning that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.550" end="00:46:29.550" style="s2">about what the game the startup do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.530" end="00:46:32.460" style="s2">right thing and it slides all the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.550" end="00:46:35.490" style="s2">down if everybody who&#39;s playing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.460" end="00:46:36.540" style="s2">market game is self-enforcing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.490" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">right thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.540" end="00:46:40.500" style="s2">you know social norms would really</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.790" style="s2">really work and anybody who plays in</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.500" end="00:46:45.900" style="s2">anything but the most virtuous way is</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.790" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">selected against through the sort of to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.900" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">the normative channel then the mark</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:52.650" style="s2">so we&#39;ll actually tend to do a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:53.609" style="s2">good job well there&#39;s more to it than</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.650" end="00:46:54.780" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.609" end="00:46:57.329" style="s2">stuff to think about that but that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.780" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">that we can focus on right here and but</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.329" end="00:47:01.589" style="s2">that&#39;s the sense markets actually have</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.390" style="s2">very little ability to perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.589" end="00:47:05.730" style="s2">kind of a thing in fact they outsource</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.390" end="00:47:09.270" style="s2">that to other areas social norms laws</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.730" end="00:47:10.950" style="s2">etc that&#39;s the channel you gain are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.270" end="00:47:13.320" style="s2">game that channel and so you show up as</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.950" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">a really great market player you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.320" end="00:47:17.460" style="s2">bank you&#39;ve got a giant building</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:19.140" style="s2">with marble columns and a actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.460" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">completely covered in marble and impress</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.140" end="00:47:23.220" style="s2">the people wearing fancy suits that all</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:26.130" style="s2">signal certain things that the market</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.220" end="00:47:27.540" style="s2">can perceive but you know the gap</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.130" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">between signal and the thing being</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.540" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">signified is something the market has</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:32.250" style="s2">effectively no capacity to perceive at</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.440" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.250" end="00:47:35.940" style="s2">and that then becomes the game when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:38.310" style="s2">move more and more and more power and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.940" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">choice making into the market you end up</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.310" end="00:47:43.320" style="s2">basically creating a niche for gaming</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:45.270" style="s2">what the market can&#39;t perceive and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.320" end="00:47:48.540" style="s2">simulating what the market perceives as</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.270" end="00:47:49.890" style="s2">being a good answer and then then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.540" end="00:47:51.630" style="s2">on that slide right do it is most</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:53.730" style="s2">profitable highest money for money</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.630" end="00:47:55.859" style="s2">return the market sees that as positive</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.730" end="00:47:57.180" style="s2">signal and you&#39;re you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.859" end="00:48:01.050" style="s2">riding the sleigh down this down the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.180" end="00:48:02.040" style="s2">hill is there more on that damn sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.050" end="00:48:03.750" style="s2">that means lots more you want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.040" end="00:48:07.530" style="s2">exploring that space no I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.750" end="00:48:09.750" style="s2">it&#39;s good I think it&#39;s important for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.530" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">I think most people today have some</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.750" end="00:48:15.329" style="s2">sense of how much greenwashing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">various forms of we are saying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.329" end="00:48:19.560" style="s2">doing a good thing as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.460" end="00:48:22.349" style="s2">marketing budget more than the actual</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.560" end="00:48:23.880" style="s2">product budget really doing a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.349" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">proliferate and I don&#39;t think most</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.880" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">people think the amount of money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:32.339" style="s2">been made in derivatives as market</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">corresponds to real goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.339" end="00:48:38.460" style="s2">that benefit the lives of most people um</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:45.000" style="s2">but I mean we could we can actually say</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.460" end="00:48:48.230" style="s2">this extremely simply if people who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.000" end="00:48:51.470" style="s2">in control of the money supply printed</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.230" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">all the money and gave it to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.470" end="00:48:57.530" style="s2">the market would have absolutely no idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:49:00.390" style="s2">and no way of responding to that fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.530" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">right I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.390" end="00:49:03.780" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:08.070" style="s2">heroin by itself the way the brain</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.070" end="00:49:12.390" style="s2">has a really hard time being able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.660" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">tell the difference internally and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.390" end="00:49:16.410" style="s2">only way you can respond to the notion</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:18.060" style="s2">of mass counterfeiting of money is</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.410" end="00:49:20.670" style="s2">through a completely different channel</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.060" end="00:49:22.650" style="s2">not known as the market now of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.670" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">you could try to invent ways to simulate</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.650" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">that okay well alright I will do is we</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:28.380" style="s2">will create agencies they were calling</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:30.900" style="s2">anti-counterfeit agencies that we will</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.380" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">pay to enforce the Fadel okay cool now</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.900" end="00:49:35.010" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:37.050" style="s2">market mechanisms to instantiate other</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.010" end="00:49:38.550" style="s2">kinds of social functions and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.050" end="00:49:40.080" style="s2">second-order solution which we be very</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.550" end="00:49:41.310" style="s2">mindful it a second-order of not first</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.080" end="00:49:42.690" style="s2">word it actually requires us to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.310" end="00:49:44.760" style="s2">thinking about this different modality</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.690" end="00:49:46.260" style="s2">and then using market mechanisms to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.760" end="00:49:48.930" style="s2">it but you end up and then is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.260" end="00:49:51.030" style="s2">regression and then of course you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.930" end="00:49:53.010" style="s2">the scenario where the lobbyists that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.030" end="00:49:55.859" style="s2">are making the laws are getting paid for</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.010" end="00:49:57.000" style="s2">by somebody and that means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.859" end="00:49:58.349" style="s2">getting paid for by the groups that have</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.000" end="00:49:59.970" style="s2">enough money to pay for them to then</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.349" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">work on creating legislation in their</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.970" end="00:50:04.500" style="s2">own interest and the campaign budgets</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:06.089" style="s2">for the politicians and the etc except</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.500" end="00:50:07.680" style="s2">right and then this again gets back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.089" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">that notion of justice injustice and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.680" end="00:50:12.359" style="s2">record-keeping that you if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:13.950" style="s2">happen to have well there&#39;s a limit to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.359" end="00:50:15.390" style="s2">this but if you happen to have something</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.950" end="00:50:16.740" style="s2">that was just really really good</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.390" end="00:50:18.660" style="s2">record-keeping and you have really</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.740" end="00:50:19.890" style="s2">high-quality to measure who&#39;s doing what</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.660" end="00:50:21.810" style="s2">to whom and what are the various</p>

<p begin="00:51:30.130" end="00:51:34.089" style="s2">learned of happening this baby</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.180" end="00:51:36.040" style="s2">we basically invert it into the defraud</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.180" end="00:51:44.500" style="s2">training may just be fraud but the point</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.430" end="00:51:45.880" style="s2">is that I can defraud you so quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.500" end="00:51:47.079" style="s2">it&#39;s such a low cost that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.880" end="00:51:48.460" style="s2">actually close the loop and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.079" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2">again I found another solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.460" end="00:51:53.079" style="s2">problem let&#39;s get back really quickly to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:54.280" style="s2">the notion of coast and I think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.079" end="00:51:56.109" style="s2">actually quite interesting in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.280" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">concept of thinking about what this how</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.109" end="00:52:02.980" style="s2">this shows up in places like medicine in</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:06.040" style="s2">pharma so Coast who is a economist at</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.980" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">University of Chicago where things like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.040" end="00:52:12.540" style="s2">markets make good choices was was the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:15.010" style="s2">theology was wondering well okay if if</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.540" end="00:52:17.410" style="s2">individual economic actors make good</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.010" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">choices in fact make better choices than</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.410" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">centralized entities do then why the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:22.900" style="s2"> do we have companies what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:24.010" style="s2">on here why do these things show up and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.900" end="00:52:25.390" style="s2">of course he said all the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.010" end="00:52:28.599" style="s2">that is because another thing going on</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.390" end="00:52:30.339" style="s2">called transaction costs and that market</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.599" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">transactions have have higher</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.339" end="00:52:35.260" style="s2">transaction costs than the transaction</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:37.869" style="s2">cost to sit inside some kind of pre</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.260" end="00:52:40.569" style="s2">associated envelope alright so if if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.869" end="00:52:44.140" style="s2">and I agree that we&#39;re gonna split the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.569" end="00:52:45.970" style="s2">returns on our activities 50/50 so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.140" end="00:52:48.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have to make any more negotiations</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.970" end="00:52:50.140" style="s2">past that first negotiation now we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.130" end="00:52:51.730" style="s2">partnership and we can now both just</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.140" end="00:52:53.500" style="s2">sort of throw into making that thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.730" end="00:52:55.630" style="s2">work oh very quickly we don&#39;t have to re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.500" end="00:52:58.420" style="s2">think about it we just are very creative</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.630" end="00:53:00.040" style="s2">at the edge whereas if every single time</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.420" end="00:53:02.079" style="s2">either one of us does something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.040" end="00:53:03.849" style="s2">constantly having to renegotiate some</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.079" end="00:53:05.470" style="s2">kind of transaction the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.849" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">negotiation and by the way the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.470" end="00:53:10.089" style="s2">monitoring and the cost of interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:13.020" style="s2">and enforcing good for the roof so what</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.089" end="00:53:16.630" style="s2">ends up happening is the market then</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.020" end="00:53:18.760" style="s2">collapses into a series of firms that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.630" end="00:53:20.380" style="s2">are defined by a boundary where on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.760" end="00:53:24.130" style="s2">inside of the boundary you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.380" end="00:53:25.690" style="s2">whole bunch of agreements that solves</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.130" end="00:53:28.660" style="s2">the transaction cost problem and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.690" end="00:53:31.550" style="s2">people to coordinate in very</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.660" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">high-velocity low-cost way and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.550" end="00:53:34.670" style="s2">those firms then do the market</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:39.170" style="s2">transactions back and forth between each</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.670" end="00:53:41.960" style="s2">other now that obviously works it built</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.170" end="00:53:43.610" style="s2">the 20th century and keep it earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.960" end="00:53:46.030" style="s2">it runs into into battery condition</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.610" end="00:53:49.010" style="s2">problems where for example information</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.030" end="00:53:50.630" style="s2">inside one of these envelopes can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.010" end="00:53:51.950" style="s2">easily translate and connect to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.630" end="00:53:54.370" style="s2">information outside one of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.950" end="00:53:57.140" style="s2">envelopes so for example it&#39;s a you had</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.370" end="00:53:58.970" style="s2">Apple and Google and inside Apple there</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.140" end="00:54:01.070" style="s2">were three engineers who had developed</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.970" end="00:54:03.260" style="s2">something really interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.070" end="00:54:04.370" style="s2">important and inside Google there were</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.260" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2">three engineers who develop something</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.370" end="00:54:07.970" style="s2">really interesting and important and in</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:10.760" style="s2">both cases the missing piece was the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.970" end="00:54:12.620" style="s2">opposite in innovation where if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.760" end="00:54:13.940" style="s2">able to connect those dots something a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.620" end="00:54:15.560" style="s2">hundred times more powerful would emerge</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.940" end="00:54:17.870" style="s2">but because they&#39;re inside those</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.560" end="00:54:19.820" style="s2">envelopes not only is there no obvious</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.870" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">way to make that connection happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.820" end="00:54:23.660" style="s2">in fact actively inhibited in fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:26.390" style="s2">possibly even illegal for them to cross</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.660" end="00:54:27.050" style="s2">those boundaries and this is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.390" end="00:54:29.240" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.050" end="00:54:31.640" style="s2">in in the in the blockchain environment</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.240" end="00:54:35.450" style="s2">and we may be in a circumstance where</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.640" end="00:54:38.420" style="s2">through automation of of contracts smart</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.450" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">contracts safer in aetherium we can</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">likely be a factor of a thousand and as</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.220" end="00:54:47.240" style="s2">a consequence collapse most of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:49.880" style="s2">economic utility is associated with</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.880" end="00:54:55.670" style="s2">therefore get a whole lot more of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.670" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">a broader shareable environment and by</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.460" end="00:55:03.830" style="s2">the way also do it in a way that enables</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:06.260" style="s2">as you said earlier sharing to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.830" end="00:55:07.910" style="s2">sense meaning on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.260" end="00:55:09.620" style="s2">record-keeping is better so the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.910" end="00:55:11.720" style="s2">innovators themselves were able to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.620" end="00:55:15.230" style="s2">high confidence that the their value</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.720" end="00:55:17.210" style="s2">will actually loop back and connect and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.230" end="00:55:18.920" style="s2">then the other hand you have ways of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.210" end="00:55:20.990" style="s2">wiring and incentive structures we could</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.920" end="00:55:24.500" style="s2">do things like actually consider the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.990" end="00:55:26.780" style="s2">Commons as a Commons and build into code</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.500" end="00:55:29.240" style="s2">rather than build into se norms or law</p>

<p begin="00:55:30.500" end="00:55:37.490" style="s2">like that so there&#39;s a few companies</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.600" end="00:55:39.140" style="s2">that are working on trying to make some</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.490" end="00:55:41.150" style="s2">ride sharing program like uber on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.140" end="00:55:41.820" style="s2">blockchain so that you decentralized the</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.820" end="00:55:46.050" style="s2">the uber the lift as a company which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.340" end="00:55:48.600" style="s2">going to be extracting a lot of profit</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.050" end="00:55:50.970" style="s2">from the system driving the price of the</p>

<p begin="00:55:53.340" end="00:55:57.930" style="s2">if you were to decentralize that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:56:00.180" style="s2">have a scenario where it would be more</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.930" end="00:56:01.740" style="s2">value to everyone with less central</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.180" end="00:56:02.760" style="s2">extraction then you say well we still</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.740" end="00:56:04.650" style="s2">have to be able to pay for the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.760" end="00:56:06.540" style="s2">well that&#39;s where an ICO or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.650" end="00:56:09.210" style="s2">comes in that you can pay for it without</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.540" end="00:56:11.130" style="s2">needing a thousand X return on an</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.210" end="00:56:12.900" style="s2">initial venture capital financial</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.130" end="00:56:15.510" style="s2">service type thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.900" end="00:56:18.150" style="s2">so that could be done with pharma</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.510" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s a lot of science to do</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.190" end="00:56:28.500" style="s2">procedure there&#39;s like real cost that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.230" end="00:56:33.540" style="s2">involved but the real cost that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.500" end="00:56:35.100" style="s2">involved doesn&#39;t end up equaling the</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.100" end="00:56:38.460" style="s2">because of all of the profit that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.080" end="00:56:40.020" style="s2">central company has to make and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.460" end="00:56:41.610" style="s2">financial services that are involved</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.020" end="00:56:44.130" style="s2">what&#39;s I mean you can actually economics</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.610" end="00:56:45.480" style="s2">are pretty easy retail is carrying the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.130" end="00:56:46.680" style="s2">full burden I mean at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.480" end="00:56:47.970" style="s2">the consumer is carrying the entire</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.680" end="00:56:51.150" style="s2">burden of the entire supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.970" end="00:56:53.070" style="s2">including investors and so to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.150" end="00:56:56.010" style="s2">to which you can you can empower the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:57.630" style="s2">consumer to create the capital structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.010" end="00:57:00.420" style="s2">that generates the innovation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.630" end="00:57:01.620" style="s2">ultimately consuming either they show up</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.420" end="00:57:02.910" style="s2">is the investor in which case they just</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.620" end="00:57:06.380" style="s2">get the return of their own consumption</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.910" end="00:57:08.490" style="s2">or prices go down either one is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.380" end="00:57:10.440" style="s2">equivalent and probably in between</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.490" end="00:57:13.110" style="s2">because some consumers will not have</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.440" end="00:57:14.490" style="s2">been capital providers and so right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.110" end="00:57:16.800" style="s2">for example and when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.490" end="00:57:19.430" style="s2">about hospitals Kerry moves to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.800" end="00:57:22.800" style="s2">retail cost of providing medical care</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">and so there already have plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.800" end="00:57:26.520" style="s2">money and they&#39;re pouring lots of dough</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:29.550" style="s2">into Pharma so this just becomes a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.520" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">for them to reduce the amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.550" end="00:57:31.830" style="s2">they&#39;re putting into something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:33.570" style="s2">already spending they just basically it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.830" end="00:57:36.330" style="s2">shows up as spending less money more</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.570" end="00:57:37.560" style="s2">effectively which if anything any of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.330" end="00:57:39.600" style="s2">stories that we tell about capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.560" end="00:57:41.010" style="s2">are even vaguely true then they should</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.600" end="00:57:42.750" style="s2">be doing that if you can spend less</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.010" end="00:57:45.900" style="s2">money to be more effective this is what</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.750" end="00:57:48.900" style="s2">you should do now there are a heap of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.900" end="00:57:51.360" style="s2">conditions that we don&#39;t yet have good</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.900" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">drugs developed for because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.360" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">profitable way to develop them the cost</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:57:55.790" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to take because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:57.710" style="s2">either not enough people that have that</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.790" end="00:57:59.480" style="s2">or because rather than treating a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.710" end="00:58:01.310" style="s2">symptom forever we&#39;d be curing something</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.480" end="00:58:04.120" style="s2">and we just can&#39;t charge enough for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.310" end="00:58:06.350" style="s2">one-time treatment to make back the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.120" end="00:58:07.880" style="s2">billion or half a billion it cost to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.350" end="00:58:10.760" style="s2">through phase 3 clinical trials and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.880" end="00:58:12.740" style="s2">current landscape right cetera so if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.760" end="00:58:14.180" style="s2">bring that if we bring the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.740" end="00:58:18.320" style="s2">actually being able to produce it down</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.180" end="00:58:20.690" style="s2">we also open up a now profitable market</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.320" end="00:58:22.730" style="s2">to work on discovery of the heaps of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.690" end="00:58:25.700" style="s2">solutions that currently just don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.730" end="00:58:28.940" style="s2">researched sure well I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.700" end="00:58:30.530" style="s2">goes down to the notion of oh cool I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.940" end="00:58:31.850" style="s2">gonna pivot this a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.530" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do is I&#39;m gonna shift the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.850" end="00:58:36.590" style="s2">language and shift it from scarcity to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:38.630" style="s2">abundance and in abundance actually to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.590" end="00:58:39.800" style="s2">talk about two things so the first is</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.630" end="00:58:41.510" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been largely talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.800" end="00:58:43.820" style="s2">which is what is the economics of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.510" end="00:58:45.890" style="s2">abundance I think it&#39;s a very nice</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.820" end="00:58:48.860" style="s2">conceptual model to say that almost all</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.890" end="00:58:51.020" style="s2">I mean to almost to the limit of all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.860" end="00:58:53.720" style="s2">the thinking about economics that has</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.020" end="00:58:57.380" style="s2">been done thus far has been scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.720" end="00:58:59.330" style="s2">economics and we&#39;re right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.380" end="00:59:00.710" style="s2">process of the obsolescence of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.330" end="00:59:03.470" style="s2">entire approach which I&#39;m gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.710" end="00:59:05.060" style="s2">in a second but this begs the question</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.470" end="00:59:07.490" style="s2">of okay what does abundance economics</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.060" end="00:59:09.550" style="s2">look like which has to do with things</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.490" end="00:59:13.910" style="s2">like okay well how do i appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.550" end="00:59:17.110" style="s2">incentivize innovative people to create</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.910" end="00:59:21.260" style="s2">solutions to gigantic problems but where</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.110" end="00:59:23.960" style="s2">scarcity and therefore profit based upon</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.260" end="00:59:25.370" style="s2">scarcity is not available as the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.960" end="00:59:26.840" style="s2">solution and this is what you just as</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.370" end="00:59:29.990" style="s2">categorical you just articulated</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.840" end="00:59:32.060" style="s2">and specifically when you make money or</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.990" end="00:59:34.220" style="s2">incentive of any kind solving a problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.060" end="00:59:36.050" style="s2">the perverse incentive there the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.220" end="00:59:37.510" style="s2">scarcity base incentive can be that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.050" end="00:59:40.250" style="s2">you&#39;re now invested in that problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.510" end="00:59:41.990" style="s2">ongoing so that you manage it right the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.250" end="00:59:45.110" style="s2">military-industrial complex the supplier</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.990" end="00:59:46.760" style="s2">complex as opposed to how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.110" end="00:59:49.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to the abundance side of make</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.760" end="00:59:51.620" style="s2">money just ops of leaving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.730" end="00:59:54.590" style="s2">rather than on going to managing yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.620" end="00:59:57.130" style="s2">fact you can even make it like how</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.590" end="00:59:59.720" style="s2">having the highest leverage on</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.130" end="01:00:00.590" style="s2">increasing collective well-being it</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.720" end="01:00:03.050" style="s2">would be the thing that you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.590" end="01:00:05.870" style="s2">to accomplish and which of course if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.050" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">would imagine taking the most innovative</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.870" end="01:00:10.440" style="s2">people and just fully and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">powering them to focus on that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.440" end="01:00:15.390" style="s2">problem that that question if you</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:20.130" style="s2">imagine how much more effective we would</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.390" end="01:00:22.740" style="s2">be I came in probably a hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.130" end="01:00:25.290" style="s2">more effective almost immediately within</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.740" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">weeks actually if you just pivot that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.290" end="01:00:32.280" style="s2">direction so in that context I&#39;m gonna I</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">want to explore a little bit a branch to</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.280" end="01:00:35.849" style="s2">the right and when we can come back to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:37.849" style="s2">this branch here if we&#39;d like which has</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.849" end="01:00:39.660" style="s2">to do with the other side of abundance</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.849" end="01:00:40.950" style="s2">and this is something that I was just</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.660" end="01:00:43.109" style="s2">talking about with some folks yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.950" end="01:00:44.730" style="s2">so it&#39;s top of mind and that has to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.109" end="01:00:47.970" style="s2">with everybody being obsolete or most</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.730" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">people being obsolete and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.970" end="01:00:53.460" style="s2">that is absolutely not that people are</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:55.650" style="s2">obsolete obviously not what I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.460" end="01:00:59.660" style="s2">that the stuff that people have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.650" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">doing to keep themselves busy goes away</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.660" end="01:01:05.310" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:07.079" style="s2">that because of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.310" end="01:01:08.849" style="s2">characteristics of how we&#39;ve gone about</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.079" end="01:01:13.319" style="s2">meeting our needs and have been trained</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.849" end="01:01:16.190" style="s2">to be valuable and useful in game a we</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.319" end="01:01:18.180" style="s2">actually quite addicted to being busy</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.190" end="01:01:19.410" style="s2">which is the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.180" end="01:01:21.900" style="s2">all right that&#39;s that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.410" end="01:01:23.550" style="s2">issue of abundance so this is why for</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.900" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">example the universal basic income is</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.550" end="01:01:28.109" style="s2">simultaneously a good idea in a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.430" style="s2">idea on the good idea front at least it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.109" end="01:01:30.900" style="s2">makes sure that people don&#39;t starve to</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.430" end="01:01:33.020" style="s2">death before we figure out a way to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.900" end="01:01:39.180" style="s2">something differently and that&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.020" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">on the bad idea front a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.180" end="01:01:45.540" style="s2">people addicted to being busy who can no</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:47.099" style="s2">longer be busy is in fact a moral</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.540" end="01:01:49.770" style="s2">ethical and ultimately actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.099" end="01:01:51.780" style="s2">political and physical disaster and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.770" end="01:01:52.980" style="s2">this actually ends up being one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.780" end="01:01:54.990" style="s2">core problems that needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.980" end="01:01:56.940" style="s2">and thought through and experimented</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.990" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">with and then delivered on which is how</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.940" end="01:02:02.369" style="s2">do we rather rapidly actually train</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:06.990" style="s2">people to kick their addiction to being</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.369" end="01:02:10.560" style="s2">busy and relearn the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.990" end="01:02:13.349" style="s2">actually engage with the world and with</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.560" end="01:02:16.619" style="s2">life authentically and without any</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.349" end="01:02:18.420" style="s2">necessity of being busy at all that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.619" end="01:02:20.609" style="s2">seems like an odd thing to be like an</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.420" end="01:02:21.270" style="s2">emergency crisis but I believe actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.609" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the emerge</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.270" end="01:02:28.470" style="s2">see crisis and it&#39;ll turn out that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:29.970" style="s2">what are the biggest economic markets in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.470" end="01:02:34.050" style="s2">the the era of technological</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.970" end="01:02:39.510" style="s2">unemployment is going to be helping</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.050" end="01:02:43.170" style="s2">people relearn how to meet their needs</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.510" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">and be fulfilled without being busy</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.170" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.210" end="01:02:55.950" style="s2">okay all right you&#39;re bringing up the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.330" end="01:02:57.860" style="s2">topic of technological automation the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.950" end="01:03:02.610" style="s2">emerging technological automation with</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.860" end="01:03:05.700" style="s2">robotics with AI etcetera obsoleting a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.610" end="01:03:07.830" style="s2">huge amount of jobs and saying people</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.700" end="01:03:10.800" style="s2">you know are currently addicted to being</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.830" end="01:03:12.770" style="s2">busy and other ways that people have</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.800" end="01:03:15.000" style="s2">said that and could identify with it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.770" end="01:03:17.430" style="s2">people have their identities wrapped up</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.000" end="01:03:19.470" style="s2">and what they do to make money and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.430" end="01:03:21.480" style="s2">a lot of fathers haven&#39;t had any wrapped</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.470" end="01:03:24.090" style="s2">up and being a provider in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.480" end="01:03:29.070" style="s2">way in the particular craft that they</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.090" end="01:03:32.340" style="s2">came from or whatever and now that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.070" end="01:03:35.310" style="s2">were gonna relate this back to you were</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.340" end="01:03:37.590" style="s2">saying that game a optimized people for</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.310" end="01:03:38.700" style="s2">filling a fairly narrow niche and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.590" end="01:03:40.050" style="s2">really care about the rest of their</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.700" end="01:03:41.640" style="s2">well-being and that narrow niche was</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.050" end="01:03:44.070" style="s2">well filled by them staying busy doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.640" end="01:03:47.640" style="s2">that thing mm-hmm and so then they of</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.070" end="01:03:49.080" style="s2">course have not learned how to and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.640" end="01:03:50.730" style="s2">education was coupled to that so</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.080" end="01:03:52.410" style="s2">education worked on making them good at</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.730" end="01:03:55.260" style="s2">identifying with being that narrow niche</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.410" end="01:03:57.390" style="s2">FULFILLER right I am a lawyer I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.260" end="01:04:01.290" style="s2">doctor I am a marketer I&#39;m a whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.390" end="01:04:03.890" style="s2">right and so in as the macro economy</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.290" end="01:04:06.090" style="s2">shifts an economy and education er are</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.890" end="01:04:10.050" style="s2">bound together in this way because the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.090" end="01:04:11.490" style="s2">economy that is the environment that</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.050" end="01:04:14.130" style="s2">people are having to be prepared for by</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.490" end="01:04:16.110" style="s2">the educational system so if we get</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.130" end="01:04:20.490" style="s2">something like universal basic income or</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.110" end="01:04:23.220" style="s2">a common wealth system based on access</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.490" end="01:04:24.840" style="s2">or something like that based on a way of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.220" end="01:04:27.300" style="s2">having technological automation not just</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.840" end="01:04:29.730" style="s2">create a total failed capitalist state</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.300" end="01:04:32.520" style="s2">this obviously requires a totally new</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.730" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">type of education mm-hmm and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.520" end="01:04:36.630" style="s2">saying how do we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:39.029" style="s2">will not get you know heal their</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.630" end="01:04:40.140" style="s2">addiction being busy so this is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.029" end="01:04:42.809" style="s2">now again we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.140" end="01:04:44.729" style="s2">intersection of personal development the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.809" end="01:04:48.089" style="s2">thing we call education vocational</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.729" end="01:04:50.939" style="s2">development purpose medicine right which</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.089" end="01:04:52.469" style="s2">is how do we create whole healthy beings</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.939" end="01:04:56.519" style="s2">and you mentioned the term sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.469" end="01:04:58.049" style="s2">which is core so I if if you would you</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.519" end="01:05:00.539" style="s2">were the first person talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.049" end="01:05:06.619" style="s2">history of the u.s. education system hmm</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.539" end="01:05:08.789" style="s2">and how it specifically evolved to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.619" end="01:05:12.029" style="s2">beings that were well designed for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.789" end="01:05:13.380" style="s2">Industrial Revolution era and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.029" end="01:05:14.999" style="s2">that&#39;s a valuable piece of history here</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.380" end="01:05:17.759" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind sharing it and then go</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.999" end="01:05:20.189" style="s2">into from that what would the future of</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.759" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">Education look like that would address</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.189" end="01:05:26.009" style="s2">this topic that you&#39;re bringing up and</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:30.049" style="s2">also the future of really supporting the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.009" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">types of whole human process needed so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.049" end="01:05:35.880" style="s2">education and well-being support and</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:37.859" style="s2">sovereignty subordinate okay great so if</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.880" end="01:05:40.140" style="s2">I lose track just let remind me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.859" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">a third piece to this move so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.140" end="01:05:47.819" style="s2">just start out with the the first which</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:50.099" style="s2">okay so back in the 19th century when we</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.819" end="01:05:52.109" style="s2">were trying to really start to formalize</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.099" end="01:05:55.229" style="s2">the approach that we were going to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.109" end="01:05:56.789" style="s2">engaging in education they were among</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.229" end="01:05:58.109" style="s2">the impact out there in fact many many</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.789" end="01:06:00.929" style="s2">ways to do education that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.109" end="01:06:02.339" style="s2">there&#39;s actually many ways when America</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.929" end="01:06:04.409" style="s2">was we need to look closely at how we</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.339" end="01:06:07.499" style="s2">were going to do it there were at least</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.409" end="01:06:09.299" style="s2">two major models that existed that had</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.499" end="01:06:10.739" style="s2">people who thought there were good ideas</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.299" end="01:06:11.609" style="s2">and had been around for a while and</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.739" end="01:06:12.539" style="s2">they&#39;re very effective they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.609" end="01:06:15.929" style="s2">many more but there were at least two</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.539" end="01:06:16.949" style="s2">they were under consideration one which</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.929" end="01:06:20.369" style="s2">is the ultimate the one that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.949" end="01:06:22.229" style="s2">adopted was the German model and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.369" end="01:06:23.429" style="s2">characteristics of this model are the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.229" end="01:06:25.049" style="s2">ones that we Americans at least are all</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.429" end="01:06:29.579" style="s2">familiar with which is the the notion</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.049" end="01:06:32.309" style="s2">that there is a subject matter area say</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.579" end="01:06:34.289" style="s2">math there is a person who is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.309" end="01:06:37.169" style="s2">designated authoritative expert known as</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.289" end="01:06:41.819" style="s2">the teacher or the professor their job</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.169" end="01:06:44.069" style="s2">is to convey the lessons the content the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.819" end="01:06:46.109" style="s2">everybody else is in the role of being a</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.069" end="01:06:48.130" style="s2">receiver of information the student</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.109" end="01:06:50.680" style="s2">whose job is to learn that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.130" end="01:06:54.120" style="s2">information and then the the teacher</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.680" end="01:06:56.890" style="s2">also has the job of demonstrating</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.120" end="01:06:57.880" style="s2">information transfer or competency in</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.890" end="01:07:00.570" style="s2">the subject matter</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.880" end="01:07:02.710" style="s2">by creating various forms of tests</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.570" end="01:07:04.510" style="s2">implementing those tests and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.710" end="01:07:06.250" style="s2">iterating on that process right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.510" end="01:07:08.020" style="s2">all it&#39;s closed so what ends up</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.250" end="01:07:11.380" style="s2">happening is that a student will have</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.020" end="01:07:13.230" style="s2">some number of teachers all more or less</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.380" end="01:07:15.160" style="s2">identical in terms of that architecture</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.230" end="01:07:16.690" style="s2">differentiated only by the content the</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.160" end="01:07:19.210" style="s2">subject matter that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.690" end="01:07:22.390" style="s2">conveying and then at the output of that</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.210" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">you will have a set of evaluations we</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.390" end="01:07:27.010" style="s2">should say how well you did on the tests</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:31.270" style="s2">indicating how capable you are in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.010" end="01:07:32.380" style="s2">underlying subject matter and when</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.270" end="01:07:36.460" style="s2">notably with this intima doing this</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.380" end="01:07:37.330" style="s2">creates a giant question mark well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.460" end="01:07:38.560" style="s2">a whole bunch of the facts but one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.330" end="01:07:40.120" style="s2">the effects it has is a giant question</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.560" end="01:07:43.210" style="s2">mark about the degree to which a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.120" end="01:07:45.400" style="s2">particular score matters because who</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.210" end="01:07:47.890" style="s2">knows how good the underlying teacher or</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.400" end="01:07:53.110" style="s2">professor was at a teaching or B testing</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.890" end="01:07:57.400" style="s2">and so maybe I have an a from a small</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.110" end="01:08:00.700" style="s2">college small College X and I&#39;ve got a C</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.400" end="01:08:02.110" style="s2">from super famous University Y it may</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.700" end="01:08:04.990" style="s2">very well be that my C is in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.110" end="01:08:07.750" style="s2">worth more than my to my a because the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.990" end="01:08:10.300" style="s2">professor in C was better had more to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.750" end="01:08:12.430" style="s2">tell more insight and Ted tested harder</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.300" end="01:08:14.020" style="s2">so being average in that domain is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.430" end="01:08:16.210" style="s2">much much better than being quick for</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.020" end="01:08:19.260" style="s2">example in another Goodman this is a you</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.210" end="01:08:21.430" style="s2">know a known issue in the German model</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.260" end="01:08:23.350" style="s2">there are lots of other known issues but</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.430" end="01:08:25.540" style="s2">then the other model that existed at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.350" end="01:08:27.670" style="s2">same time existed this day is the Oxford</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.540" end="01:08:29.830" style="s2">Cambridge model of England which</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.670" end="01:08:32.920" style="s2">operates very differently and in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.830" end="01:08:36.210" style="s2">environment first the student is</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.920" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">principally responsible for in fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.210" end="01:08:42.010" style="s2">consuming information right so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:44.680" style="s2">student does a lot of reading and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.010" end="01:08:48.070" style="s2">do interviewing and learning the subject</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.680" end="01:08:49.810" style="s2">matter they then have a tutor who has</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.070" end="01:08:52.150" style="s2">domain expertise who understands the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.810" end="01:08:53.830" style="s2">subject matter and interacts with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.150" end="01:08:55.210" style="s2">student to help the student puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.830" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">through certain problems points them in</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.210" end="01:08:58.840" style="s2">different directions maybe helps them</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">think more clearly about where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.840" end="01:09:04.009" style="s2">getting turned around</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:05.750" style="s2">the tutor is not responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.009" end="01:09:07.579" style="s2">conveying the information per se that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.750" end="01:09:09.559" style="s2">the student job and the tutor is not</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.579" end="01:09:11.210" style="s2">responsible for evaluating the quality</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.559" end="01:09:13.039" style="s2">of the students work that&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.210" end="01:09:16.210" style="s2">separate function where you actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.039" end="01:09:18.289" style="s2">have a impaneled group who crafts</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.210" end="01:09:20.139" style="s2">generalized tests that are given to</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.289" end="01:09:22.849" style="s2">everybody in a particular subject matter</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.139" end="01:09:25.670" style="s2">many different groups tend to be</p>

<p begin="01:09:25.670" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">happening is that if I have a you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.710" end="01:09:32.509" style="s2">an a with the equivalent of an A in math</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:33.559" style="s2">across the entire set of universities to</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.509" end="01:09:37.309" style="s2">participate in the Oxford Cambridge</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.559" end="01:09:39.710" style="s2">model then I should be at a standard</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.309" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">no matter what university I went to so a</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.710" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">very very good University might have</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:46.579" style="s2">more people who show up at a but if I go</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:49.130" style="s2">to a you know small podunk college I</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.579" end="01:09:53.750" style="s2">still have an A then I&#39;m considered to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.130" end="01:09:54.889" style="s2">be a peer to them in capability now the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.750" end="01:09:56.119" style="s2">reason why this is interesting by the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.889" end="01:09:58.280" style="s2">way is just to a third which is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.119" end="01:10:00.139" style="s2">guilt model and the Guildhall you</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.280" end="01:10:01.190" style="s2">actually have a even a different</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.139" end="01:10:03.500" style="s2">approach and this is because in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.190" end="01:10:05.659" style="s2">guilt model you&#39;re largely trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:07.519" style="s2">convey things that actually can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.659" end="01:10:10.070" style="s2">well done through information transfer</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.519" end="01:10:12.619" style="s2">they&#39;re more associated with complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.070" end="01:10:19.219" style="s2">skills practices you know classically</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.619" end="01:10:21.559" style="s2">things like say carpentry or medicine</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.219" end="01:10:23.809" style="s2">this is actually pretty guilty we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.559" end="01:10:25.670" style="s2">then apprentices foodies who&#39;s somebody</p>

<p begin="01:10:26.869" end="01:10:30.650" style="s2">master gives them tasks that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.239" end="01:10:32.480" style="s2">designed to be at their level of</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.650" end="01:10:33.500" style="s2">capability but by virtue of doing them</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.480" end="01:10:35.630" style="s2">they increase their level of capability</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.500" end="01:10:37.190" style="s2">and the master basically just puts them</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.630" end="01:10:39.409" style="s2">on a path of more and more and more</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.190" end="01:10:41.659" style="s2">complex tasks and the individual student</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.409" end="01:10:41.840" style="s2">just by doing stuff and every once a</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.659" end="01:10:43.550" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.840" end="01:10:45.349" style="s2">interventions and hints and notes and</p>

<p begin="01:10:48.739" end="01:10:54.760" style="s2">take all program thing by the way there</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.980" end="01:10:57.230" style="s2">are many many other approaches and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.760" end="01:10:59.090" style="s2">the Samantha that&#39;s the history the</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.230" end="01:11:01.179" style="s2">history is that we as Americans locked</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.090" end="01:11:03.619" style="s2">into a particular model and then have</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.179" end="01:11:05.449" style="s2">using our earlier language the basin of</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.619" end="01:11:07.610" style="s2">Attraction now is completely locked in</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.449" end="01:11:09.949" style="s2">meaning that I actually remember very</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.610" end="01:11:11.510" style="s2">clearly when I was in first grade the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.949" end="01:11:13.010" style="s2">teacher was telling us that we had to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.510" end="01:11:14.490" style="s2">work really hard on this particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.010" end="01:11:17.640" style="s2">piece because I tell you what</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.490" end="01:11:18.900" style="s2">great is no joke much harder and gotta</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.640" end="01:11:19.890" style="s2">kind of get if you can&#39;t you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.900" end="01:11:21.510" style="s2">well in second grade you got to do well</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.890" end="01:11:22.620" style="s2">now and of course there&#39;s just a handoff</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.510" end="01:11:24.120" style="s2">if you want to do well in fifth grade</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.620" end="01:11:25.440" style="s2">you get a b-tree shirt together in 4th</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.120" end="01:11:27.540" style="s2">grade if you want to do it all the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.440" end="01:11:28.680" style="s2">up until finally well why am i doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.540" end="01:11:30.330" style="s2">this at all well if you want to get a</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.680" end="01:11:33.200" style="s2">good job right in the hand off from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.330" end="01:11:35.460" style="s2">education vertical to the work vertical</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.200" end="01:11:38.160" style="s2">now the couple of things come out and</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.460" end="01:11:40.830" style="s2">the one that entire model was already</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.160" end="01:11:42.690" style="s2">linked to the notion of getting a job or</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.830" end="01:11:44.490" style="s2">getting a good job or being qualified</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.690" end="01:11:45.900" style="s2">for a particular job and remember this</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.490" end="01:11:48.150" style="s2">is true just to high school even</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.900" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">vocational school was college being</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.150" end="01:11:52.140" style="s2">added on after World War two and as the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:54.240" style="s2">economy moved more and more into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.140" end="01:11:57.410" style="s2">domain where information processing</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.240" end="01:11:59.490" style="s2">capability and credential ization became</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.410" end="01:12:02.850" style="s2">minimum requirements for having could</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.490" end="01:12:05.970" style="s2">include a good job in the economy and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.850" end="01:12:08.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s reasonably good at conveying</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.970" end="01:12:10.260" style="s2">what does it call dat France is it wrote</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.460" end="01:12:12.420" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really good for conveying</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.260" end="01:12:14.610" style="s2">information and people who process</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.420" end="01:12:17.850" style="s2">through that model will end up doing a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.610" end="01:12:20.580" style="s2">pretty good job at crank turning give me</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.850" end="01:12:22.410" style="s2">an input where I&#39;ve been Matt I have</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.580" end="01:12:23.670" style="s2">actually learned a particular process to</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.410" end="01:12:25.230" style="s2">process that input and I will give you</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.670" end="01:12:27.270" style="s2">with pretty high predictability a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.230" end="01:12:29.370" style="s2">predictable output which maps pretty</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.270" end="01:12:31.350" style="s2">closely to industrial civilization the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.370" end="01:12:33.590" style="s2">idea was the education system and the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.350" end="01:12:36.180" style="s2">economic system of the era were</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.590" end="01:12:38.460" style="s2">unsurprisingly similar to each other so</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.180" end="01:12:45.090" style="s2">if I if I had an early Industrial</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.460" end="01:12:47.820" style="s2">Revolution with you know the types of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.090" end="01:12:50.130" style="s2">production lines where I just needed</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.820" end="01:12:52.770" style="s2">people to be able to do a certain job</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.130" end="01:12:54.330" style="s2">that needed to be fully fungible I could</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.770" end="01:12:57.000" style="s2">remove someone from that job but someone</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.330" end="01:12:58.620" style="s2">else in and I needed X number of people</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.000" end="01:13:00.630" style="s2">on the assembly line to do that thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.620" end="01:13:02.370" style="s2">and then if they were off the assembly</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.630" end="01:13:04.590" style="s2">line and they were a bookkeeper I needed</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.370" end="01:13:06.090" style="s2">to know okay this person can do this</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.590" end="01:13:08.430" style="s2">function called bookkeeping so I could</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.090" end="01:13:10.740" style="s2">make an org chart and make a firm then</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.430" end="01:13:13.110" style="s2">in that environment we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.740" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">using people like we&#39;re making robots to</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.110" end="01:13:17.910" style="s2">do now using them for a very specific</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:20.310" style="s2">defined process function so then the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.910" end="01:13:21.630" style="s2">goal is make them a good robot yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.310" end="01:13:25.140" style="s2">I think this is this is probably the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.630" end="01:13:27.930" style="s2">best way of grasping it it&#39;s in any kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.140" end="01:13:29.730" style="s2">of thing that you&#39;re doing that has</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.930" end="01:13:31.680" style="s2">similar characteristics over and over</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.730" end="01:13:33.810" style="s2">again they&#39;re always learning everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.680" end="01:13:35.070" style="s2">about your learning system doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.810" end="01:13:36.900" style="s2">what it&#39;s learning so it&#39;s to just grab</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.070" end="01:13:39.330" style="s2">grabbing patterns and learning how to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.900" end="01:13:40.710" style="s2">adapt to those patterns so you know if</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.330" end="01:13:43.650" style="s2">you&#39;re going to kindergarten all the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.710" end="01:13:45.480" style="s2">up just just make it high school you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.650" end="01:13:47.490" style="s2">exposed to a wide variety of different</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.480" end="01:13:48.750" style="s2">kinds of content are you doing English</p>

<p begin="01:13:48.750" end="01:13:51.060" style="s2">studies you actually supposed to why</p>

<p begin="01:13:51.060" end="01:13:56.960" style="s2">but what is exactly the same every</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.460" end="01:14:03.500" style="s2">single time is this core architecture of</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.900" end="01:14:11.550" style="s2">actually learn in this system is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.940" end="01:14:12.660" style="s2">model if that&#39;s the key transfer doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.550" end="01:14:14.310" style="s2">actually matter whether or not you take</p>

<p begin="01:14:16.680" end="01:14:21.810" style="s2">because everybody learned how to operate</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.290" end="01:15:15.110" style="s2">and I guess the point here is that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.450" end="01:15:18.210" style="s2">output of that is people who in fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.110" end="01:15:19.890" style="s2">really rather dramatically lost their</p>

<p begin="01:15:19.890" end="01:15:24.630" style="s2">lost their individual capacity to for</p>

<p begin="01:15:42.690" end="01:15:48.119" style="s2">speaking to this model it was meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.480" end="01:15:49.889" style="s2">to me and he said this the kids that</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.119" end="01:15:51.329" style="s2">seemed smarter more talented we pushed</p>

<p begin="01:15:51.329" end="01:15:54.300" style="s2">then we pushed them further and further</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.590" end="01:15:56.520" style="s2">into specialization so by the time they</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.300" end="01:15:58.679" style="s2">finished their PhD it is on the most</p>

<p begin="01:15:58.679" end="01:16:02.820" style="s2">string theory with it only a few other</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.270" end="01:16:05.460" style="s2">people in the world know and so none of</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.820" end="01:16:07.020" style="s2">the people that have a lot of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.460" end="01:16:09.270" style="s2">horsepower ever looking at the whole</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.270" end="01:16:12.239" style="s2">disturbed you would try and make it do</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.889" end="01:16:15.719" style="s2">that right you would make them very</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.239" end="01:16:16.920" style="s2">sharp gears inside the machine but not</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.719" end="01:16:18.809" style="s2">something that was looking at me</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.920" end="01:16:21.090" style="s2">designing redesigning the machine as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.809" end="01:16:22.380" style="s2">whole so then the people who are left to</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.090" end="01:16:24.690" style="s2">actually look at the whole and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.380" end="01:16:27.059" style="s2">wrong with it an externality are people</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.690" end="01:16:29.699" style="s2">that didn&#39;t do that well in the system</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.059" end="01:16:31.349" style="s2">as a whole and so now we&#39;re in a world</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.699" end="01:16:32.730" style="s2">where we have to actually redesign the</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.349" end="01:16:34.320" style="s2">entire system the whole game that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.730" end="01:16:35.909" style="s2">requires a different set of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.320" end="01:16:37.889" style="s2">than how to optimize some tiny part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.909" end="01:16:43.770" style="s2">it yeah and this is true in both</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.889" end="01:16:48.030" style="s2">directions meaning that everybody has to</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.770" end="01:16:50.579" style="s2">actually shift although I guess to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.030" end="01:16:52.050" style="s2">sure there is differential value to</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.579" end="01:16:57.920" style="s2">different people the shifting different</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.050" end="01:17:00.929" style="s2">capacities there&#39;s the more you can get</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.920" end="01:17:03.679" style="s2">people that have been selected for high</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.929" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">cognitive horsepower to have for example</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.679" end="01:17:10.079" style="s2">more awareness of the whole more saving</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:14.000" style="s2">a broader scope of empathy or a better</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.079" end="01:17:16.440" style="s2">sense of how externalities actually work</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.000" end="01:17:18.059" style="s2">one the more they&#39;ll be able to play</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.440" end="01:17:19.290" style="s2">together they&#39;ll be able to collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.059" end="01:17:22.139" style="s2">with each other which radically</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.290" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">increases their capabilities but then to</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.139" end="01:17:25.760" style="s2">the less likely they are to use that</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:27.659" style="s2">cognitive horsepower for Bad ends</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:29.610" style="s2">because they&#39;ll just be aware of it we</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.659" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">know they&#39;ll notice it themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.610" end="01:17:35.099" style="s2">then they&#39;ll engineer around okay so now</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:38.130" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that these people</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.099" end="01:17:40.679" style="s2">who were actually the education system</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.130" end="01:17:43.590" style="s2">was actually optimizing for deferring to</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.679" end="01:17:45.659" style="s2">Authority and who being part of an</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.590" end="01:17:47.280" style="s2">authoritarian structure even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.659" end="01:17:48.809" style="s2">an authority within it you&#39;re also still</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:51.900" style="s2">subordinate to other authorities that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.809" end="01:17:53.699" style="s2">the whole deal and that people lost</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.900" end="01:17:58.469" style="s2">their sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.699" end="01:17:59.969" style="s2">and now we&#39;re saying if you want to take</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.469" end="01:18:01.320" style="s2">the people high intellectual capacity</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.969" end="01:18:02.670" style="s2">and make them really sovereign they need</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.320" end="01:18:05.880" style="s2">things like empathy and the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.670" end="01:18:09.300" style="s2">work with other people would you define</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.880" end="01:18:10.469" style="s2">sovereignty and now I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.300" end="01:18:11.940" style="s2">that&#39;s something we&#39;ve used quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.469" end="01:18:14.670" style="s2">and we need to actually be pretty clear</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.940" end="01:18:17.810" style="s2">about what we mean because first if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.670" end="01:18:21.449" style="s2">happen to be doing this from a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.810" end="01:18:23.250" style="s2">old-school American history we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.449" end="01:18:25.650" style="s2">mean the same thing I think that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.250" end="01:18:26.760" style="s2">Jefferson meant and if you&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.650" end="01:18:28.710" style="s2">around kind of in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.760" end="01:18:30.929" style="s2">environment we definitely don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.710" end="01:18:33.810" style="s2">same thing that if the freemen movement</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.929" end="01:18:35.310" style="s2">means it&#39;s kind of a term of art</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.810" end="01:18:38.040" style="s2">actually but it&#39;s such a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.310" end="01:18:39.449" style="s2">concept that I think we want to get a</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.040" end="01:18:42.780" style="s2">good definition and get that definition</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.449" end="01:18:45.810" style="s2">out into the world so the the basic</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.780" end="01:18:48.870" style="s2">proposition is that sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.810" end="01:18:52.560" style="s2">represents your capacity to be an</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.870" end="01:18:55.199" style="s2">effective agent in the world but of</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.560" end="01:18:56.489" style="s2">course what was that mean so if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.199" end="01:18:59.250" style="s2">think about what it means to be an age</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.489" end="01:19:02.010" style="s2">in the world that has to do with on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.250" end="01:19:03.360" style="s2">one hand your ability to have accurate</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.010" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">perceptions of what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.360" end="01:19:07.530" style="s2">world but if you&#39;re if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:08.820" style="s2">perceive what&#39;s happening you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.530" end="01:19:13.410" style="s2">good choices you can&#39;t respond very</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.820" end="01:19:15.330" style="s2">effectively and then second your ability</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.410" end="01:19:17.460" style="s2">to make sense of those perceptions you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.330" end="01:19:19.800" style="s2">know so if you&#39;re overwhelmed by too</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.460" end="01:19:21.330" style="s2">much input or you don&#39;t have the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.800" end="01:19:23.340" style="s2">frameworks to take the information that</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.330" end="01:19:27.810" style="s2">you see now this is say for example the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.340" end="01:19:30.510" style="s2">problem of the tsunami back in the in</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.810" end="01:19:32.969" style="s2">Phuket where people could see they can</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.510" end="01:19:34.170" style="s2">visibly see that the sea had receded but</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.969" end="01:19:35.940" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t make sense of what was</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.170" end="01:19:40.260" style="s2">going on so they couldn&#39;t then make good</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.940" end="01:19:41.550" style="s2">choices and then and then third is then</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.260" end="01:19:43.110" style="s2">the ability to take the ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.550" end="01:19:45.719" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s going on and then take a</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.110" end="01:19:47.580" style="s2">look at then what you could do the kinds</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.719" end="01:19:50.219" style="s2">of actions you can take and connect</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.580" end="01:19:51.810" style="s2">those two together into making good</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.219" end="01:19:54.840" style="s2">choices the choices that are most likely</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.810" end="01:19:58.320" style="s2">to simultaneously deliver on the results</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.840" end="01:19:59.760" style="s2">that you desire and the least amount of</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.320" end="01:20:00.929" style="s2">negative consequences in the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.760" end="01:20:01.429" style="s2">externalities with the least amount of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.929" end="01:20:03.480" style="s2">effort</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.429" end="01:20:05.070" style="s2">and then the last piece is in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.480" end="01:20:06.960" style="s2">actuation piece which is which is then</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.070" end="01:20:09.870" style="s2">the execution on those choices</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.960" end="01:20:11.730" style="s2">so that they actually do deliver the</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.870" end="01:20:13.380" style="s2">results you intend with the least amount</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.730" end="01:20:16.530" style="s2">of unintended consequences Amitha least</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.380" end="01:20:19.350" style="s2">amount of effort and so that whole that</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.530" end="01:20:22.110" style="s2">entire construct is what we&#39;re defining</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.350" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">as sovereignty and what&#39;s important is</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.110" end="01:20:26.190" style="s2">to actually recognize it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:28.500" style="s2">spherical geometry to this thing meaning</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.190" end="01:20:30.210" style="s2">that if you&#39;re over balanced any one of</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.500" end="01:20:32.730" style="s2">these characteristics that lack of</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.210" end="01:20:34.200" style="s2">balance you know you think about like it</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.730" end="01:20:36.480" style="s2">takes the sphere out of round so you</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.200" end="01:20:37.770" style="s2">might actually have say like a wheel</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.480" end="01:20:40.110" style="s2">that&#39;s got a dent in it and so as its</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.770" end="01:20:42.570" style="s2">rolling it keeps flopping this might be</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.110" end="01:20:45.810" style="s2">for example somebody who lacks the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.570" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">ability to make sense of let&#39;s make a</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.810" end="01:20:49.170" style="s2">very simple example other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:50.490" style="s2">facial expressions alright so I can see</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.170" end="01:20:52.110" style="s2">that your face is doing stuff but I</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.490" end="01:20:54.570" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of it so now what ends</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.110" end="01:20:55.740" style="s2">up happening is that my capacity to take</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.570" end="01:20:57.330" style="s2">information from my environment</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.740" end="01:20:59.580" style="s2">converted into meaning and make good</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.330" end="01:21:01.020" style="s2">choices it&#39;s got a big blind spot which</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.580" end="01:21:02.430" style="s2">is going to show up for example and me</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.020" end="01:21:03.750" style="s2">making weird choices around other</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.430" end="01:21:05.100" style="s2">people&#39;s behavior because I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.750" end="01:21:06.960" style="s2">actually read their faces that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.100" end="01:21:08.850" style="s2">a simple example lots and lots of stamps</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.960" end="01:21:10.380" style="s2">looking on this if you can&#39;t hear then I</p>

<p begin="01:21:12.900" end="01:21:15.810" style="s2">any of the dimensions so the point is</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.280" end="01:21:18.660" style="s2">that there&#39;s actually a very interesting</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.580" end="01:21:22.590" style="s2">do is you want to take a look at</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.510" end="01:21:25.410" style="s2">somebody and make sure that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.590" end="01:21:28.590" style="s2">in round but their spheres is as round</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.410" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">as it is it can be then you can start</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.590" end="01:21:31.710" style="s2">thinking about how to expand this fear</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:32.880" style="s2">and this actually loops us back all the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.710" end="01:21:35.310" style="s2">way to the beginning remember we talked</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.880" end="01:21:36.870" style="s2">about how complex systems have all kinds</p>

<p begin="01:21:45.810" end="01:21:49.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all these different elements</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.580" end="01:21:51.330" style="s2">that are very tightly wound into how</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.290" end="01:21:53.130" style="s2">you&#39;re able to show up in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.330" end="01:21:55.110" style="s2">there&#39;s only so much I can do to</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.130" end="01:21:57.480" style="s2">increase for example your cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.110" end="01:21:59.010" style="s2">intellect if I do also increase your</p>

<p begin="01:21:59.010" end="01:22:03.270" style="s2">also increase your ability to act in the</p>

<p begin="01:22:05.190" end="01:22:10.890" style="s2">humans is that we have a massively</p>

<p begin="01:22:23.250" end="01:22:27.270" style="s2">about it so our response then is to feel</p>

<p begin="01:23:23.430" end="01:23:27.540" style="s2">sovereignty is all wacky and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.830" end="01:23:29.460" style="s2">actually get things done but as that</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.540" end="01:23:31.350" style="s2">team practices in practice and starts to</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.460" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">get real fluid with each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.350" end="01:23:35.100" style="s2">perception sense-making choice making</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:36.630" style="s2">actuation elements begin to flow through</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.100" end="01:23:38.940" style="s2">nicely and then you actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.630" end="01:23:41.310" style="s2">sovereignty as a team that begins to</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.940" end="01:23:46.800" style="s2">increase and the same thing happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.310" end="01:23:49.800" style="s2">just scale all the way up okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.800" end="01:23:51.390" style="s2">lot okay so one I want to restate the</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.800" end="01:23:53.970" style="s2">essential point really clearly make sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.390" end="01:23:55.739" style="s2">everyone gotten so sovereignty made up</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.970" end="01:23:56.940" style="s2">of three things and the reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.739" end="01:23:58.739" style="s2">saying a sphere is you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.940" end="01:24:00.210" style="s2">these three things are the three axes</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.739" end="01:24:01.950" style="s2">that would make up a three dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.210" end="01:24:04.020" style="s2">shape like a sphere so that they that</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.950" end="01:24:05.460" style="s2">means they&#39;re orthogonal to each other</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.020" end="01:24:07.950" style="s2">they&#39;re they actually represent the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.460" end="01:24:11.750" style="s2">vector space of being a human of</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.950" end="01:24:14.580" style="s2">sovereignty and you said sensory input</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.750" end="01:24:16.830" style="s2">information processing of that sensory</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.580" end="01:24:19.140" style="s2">input to inform a choice and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.830" end="01:24:20.489" style="s2">actually acting actuator output and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.140" end="01:24:21.989" style="s2">there&#39;s a closed loop because then you</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.489" end="01:24:25.440" style="s2">act in the world and you can in turn</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.989" end="01:24:27.090" style="s2">sense the effects of the action and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.440" end="01:24:29.489" style="s2">make sense of it in acting energy of</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.090" end="01:24:32.160" style="s2">this closed loop hmm and that we have</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.489" end="01:24:34.500" style="s2">just words that we&#39;ve used before and we</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.160" end="01:24:36.420" style="s2">use you know this is actually related</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.500" end="01:24:38.010" style="s2">to the mission statement of neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.420" end="01:24:40.560" style="s2">of sovereignty increasing this</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.010" end="01:24:44.040" style="s2">definition of sovereignty that we think</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:46.770" style="s2">of the sensory part of it the first part</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.040" end="01:24:49.860" style="s2">of it as related to sentient right the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.770" end="01:24:51.540" style="s2">ability to actually have not just that</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.860" end="01:24:53.400" style="s2">information is coming in that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.540" end="01:24:56.850" style="s2">landing in a being that&#39;s recognizing it</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.400" end="01:24:58.740" style="s2">and experiencing it and that the second</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.850" end="01:25:00.660" style="s2">part the ability to take all of that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.740" end="01:25:04.170" style="s2">internal sensing right our own feelings</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.660" end="01:25:05.700" style="s2">or proprioception are our past awareness</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.170" end="01:25:07.080" style="s2">and learning plus what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.700" end="01:25:10.200" style="s2">the world around us from our eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.080" end="01:25:13.950" style="s2">ears and information and make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.200" end="01:25:16.230" style="s2">it is intelligence and then agency is</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.950" end="01:25:19.470" style="s2">our ability to then act on that in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.230" end="01:25:20.850" style="s2">world especially act in the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.470" end="01:25:23.910" style="s2">pressures that might make it hard act</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.850" end="01:25:26.730" style="s2">right increasing agent passing yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.910" end="01:25:30.960" style="s2">the triplicate of sentient intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.730" end="01:25:33.240" style="s2">and agency makes up this sphere now if</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:36.660" style="s2">someone has very high agency meaning</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.240" end="01:25:38.820" style="s2">they&#39;re very motivated they have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.660" end="01:25:41.280" style="s2">of resilience but they&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.820" end="01:25:43.140" style="s2">making good sense of the world they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.280" end="01:25:45.860" style="s2">gonna make a lot of very powerful very</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.140" end="01:25:48.480" style="s2">bad choices mm-hmm if someone is</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.860" end="01:25:50.490" style="s2">actually sensing the world well and very</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.480" end="01:25:52.740" style="s2">intelligent that has low agency then</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.490" end="01:25:53.820" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have a lot of good ideas</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.740" end="01:25:55.110" style="s2">and be crippled to make them happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.820" end="01:25:57.180" style="s2">right we can look at any of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.110" end="01:25:59.600" style="s2">combinations of these and say only all</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.180" end="01:26:02.730" style="s2">three ends up actually being adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.600" end="01:26:04.680" style="s2">right now we should be careful under</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.730" end="01:26:06.600" style="s2">certain circumstances they out-of-round</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.680" end="01:26:11.240" style="s2">is right we talked about for example if</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.600" end="01:26:15.360" style="s2">you&#39;re a fighter pilot in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.240" end="01:26:18.390" style="s2">dogfight big chunks of sensory capacity</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.360" end="01:26:19.800" style="s2">and sense-making need to be not input</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.390" end="01:26:22.140" style="s2">and you actually need to have a</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.800" end="01:26:24.150" style="s2">different shape than in round right and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.140" end="01:26:26.580" style="s2">this is actually I mean we do the whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.150" end="01:26:30.120" style="s2">complicated complex thing as well</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.580" end="01:26:32.780" style="s2">that being in a pure in a high quality</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.120" end="01:26:35.670" style="s2">sphere is maximally adapted under</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.780" end="01:26:37.530" style="s2">uncertain conditions meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.670" end="01:26:39.060" style="s2">environments where what the future is</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.530" end="01:26:40.980" style="s2">going to look like is not exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.060" end="01:26:42.690" style="s2">same as it looks right now and then in</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.980" end="01:26:45.120" style="s2">that case it is for sure the case that</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.690" end="01:26:45.980" style="s2">is fear is the best geometry and I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.120" end="01:26:48.650" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.980" end="01:26:51.460" style="s2">but one way of saying it would be to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.650" end="01:26:54.350" style="s2">fighter pilot obviously has to be in</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.460" end="01:26:56.420" style="s2">taking information making sense of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.350" end="01:27:00.320" style="s2">information and acting on it but the</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.420" end="01:27:02.300" style="s2">information about how much they need to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.320" end="01:27:04.040" style="s2">go to the bathroom and lots of other</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.300" end="01:27:06.290" style="s2">things they need to really suppress and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.040" end="01:27:07.870" style="s2">hyper pay attention to their visual cues</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.870" end="01:27:12.440" style="s2">but the adaptive capacity to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.940" end="01:27:15.320" style="s2">pay attention to the right information</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.440" end="01:27:17.120" style="s2">and to not pay attention to the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.320" end="01:27:19.340" style="s2">information because then when that same</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.120" end="01:27:21.650" style="s2">person is making love or tending to a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.340" end="01:27:23.270" style="s2">baby it&#39;s different things they need to</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.650" end="01:27:26.480" style="s2">pay attention to with their limited</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.270" end="01:27:28.820" style="s2">bandwidth I mean this is a it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.480" end="01:27:30.739" style="s2">round it&#39;s just different rounds based</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.820" end="01:27:32.810" style="s2">on the environment yeah well I get to</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.739" end="01:27:34.940" style="s2">this state switching between domains is</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.810" end="01:27:38.330" style="s2">the problem and so it happens in the in</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.940" end="01:27:40.580" style="s2">the game a is the training will build</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.330" end="01:27:43.370" style="s2">whatever your roundness is in a given</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.580" end="01:27:45.770" style="s2">domain but you don&#39;t have the individual</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.370" end="01:27:48.140" style="s2">agency of the individual capacity to do</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.770" end="01:27:49.610" style="s2">your own kind of state switching and</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.140" end="01:27:51.620" style="s2">your own kind of designing of your own</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.610" end="01:27:53.960" style="s2">Socrates I gave a domain so England I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.620" end="01:27:57.020" style="s2">having is go ahead most of the fighter</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.960" end="01:27:58.760" style="s2">pilots and other you know people highly</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.020" end="01:28:00.739" style="s2">trained and military coming back after</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.760" end="01:28:02.720" style="s2">the war and being really mal adapted to</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.739" end="01:28:04.970" style="s2">a non Moore environment right exactly so</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.720" end="01:28:07.460" style="s2">then they&#39;ve been pushed by external</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.970" end="01:28:09.770" style="s2">extrinsic factors into a particular sub</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.460" end="01:28:11.210" style="s2">specialization of was in fact very high</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.770" end="01:28:14.030" style="s2">qualit quality sovereignty and a very</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.210" end="01:28:16.340" style="s2">specific domain but if the cost of their</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.030" end="01:28:18.890" style="s2">in fact actual intrinsic we might call</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.340" end="01:28:19.820" style="s2">human sovereignty and I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.890" end="01:28:21.830" style="s2">kind of the point it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.820" end="01:28:24.140" style="s2">example all of us in some sense have</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.830" end="01:28:25.580" style="s2">PTSD all of us in some very important</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.140" end="01:28:28.100" style="s2">sense have actually undergone that</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.580" end="01:28:30.950" style="s2">process of losing our intrinsic human</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.100" end="01:28:33.500" style="s2">sovereignty to become who we want to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.950" end="01:28:35.270" style="s2">and in any kind of context and have</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.500" end="01:28:37.520" style="s2">become to a greater or lesser extent</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.270" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">very specialized and having been</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.520" end="01:28:46.130" style="s2">separated from our core capacity sure</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:48.860" style="s2">then what does what is education some</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.130" end="01:28:50.120" style="s2">more sovereign beings look like yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.860" end="01:28:52.100" style="s2">this was actually the third thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.120" end="01:28:53.810" style="s2">wanted to talk about on the education</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.100" end="01:28:58.040" style="s2">wreck is that it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.810" end="01:28:59.219" style="s2">actually I think quite lucky they were</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.040" end="01:29:02.460" style="s2">actually coming into this</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.219" end="01:29:05.909" style="s2">from two distinct directions so one</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.460" end="01:29:08.880" style="s2">direction is the what happens to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.909" end="01:29:11.489" style="s2">educational model the German model in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.880" end="01:29:13.559" style="s2">pace of accelerating change and what I</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.489" end="01:29:16.229" style="s2">mean by that is in a pace where for</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.559" end="01:29:18.840" style="s2">example having asymmetric information</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.229" end="01:29:20.219" style="s2">becomes less and less true having access</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.840" end="01:29:21.269" style="s2">to information becomes more and more of</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.219" end="01:29:24.929" style="s2">a commodity right it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.269" end="01:29:26.159" style="s2">matter at all if I is actually really</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.929" end="01:29:29.579" style="s2">good example remember this when I was</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.159" end="01:29:31.170" style="s2">kind of in high school there was a time</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.579" end="01:29:34.619" style="s2">when knowing the multiplication tables</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.170" end="01:29:36.659" style="s2">in your head was extremely useful now is</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.619" end="01:29:38.070" style="s2">not that time right though if I am</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.659" end="01:29:39.360" style="s2">separated from a device that can</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.070" end="01:29:41.249" style="s2">calculate long division</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.360" end="01:29:43.849" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually got bigger problems than</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.249" end="01:29:46.499" style="s2">my inability to calculate long division</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.849" end="01:29:48.059" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s no longer a</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.499" end="01:29:49.889" style="s2">functional capacity does it matter right</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.059" end="01:29:51.599" style="s2">I can just import that capacity through</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.889" end="01:29:52.499" style="s2">some kind of tool and do it a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.599" end="01:29:54.360" style="s2">lot better than I could ever have done</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.499" end="01:29:56.579" style="s2">it by spending countless hours learning</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.360" end="01:29:58.170" style="s2">how to do it internally and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.579" end="01:29:59.460" style="s2">true generic so think about driving you</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.170" end="01:30:01.469" style="s2">know driving around not only is like</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.460" end="01:30:03.150" style="s2">haven&#39;t being able to read a map</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.469" end="01:30:04.559" style="s2">becoming an obsolete skill but soon</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.150" end="01:30:08.249" style="s2">driving it all is going to be an</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.559" end="01:30:10.070" style="s2">obsolete skill etc etc etc so the output</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.249" end="01:30:12.389" style="s2">the theme for which this authoritative</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.070" end="01:30:14.940" style="s2">authoritarian training regime was ever</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.389" end="01:30:16.349" style="s2">useful which was putting specialized</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.940" end="01:30:17.489" style="s2">knowledge in the hands of specialized</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.349" end="01:30:20.550" style="s2">people who could operate within a</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.489" end="01:30:23.159" style="s2">hierarchical framework that entire thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.550" end="01:30:25.469" style="s2">is becoming obsolete at Lightspeed</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.159" end="01:30:27.479" style="s2">so one side of the equation is ok well</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.469" end="01:30:31.229" style="s2"> if we want to go through the basic</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.479" end="01:30:33.119" style="s2">art of called retraining or educating</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.229" end="01:30:34.739" style="s2">anyone to be adaptive to the Future</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.119" end="01:30:37.469" style="s2">environment what we have to do is we</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.739" end="01:30:39.809" style="s2">have to unwind a lot of that and think</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.469" end="01:30:42.929" style="s2">about ok well you&#39;re gonna be in not 10</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.809" end="01:30:44.849" style="s2">careers in your lifetime but 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.929" end="01:30:46.800" style="s2">careers in the next day all right</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.849" end="01:30:49.260" style="s2">something like that where the only</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.800" end="01:30:50.550" style="s2">possible approach is to maximize your</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.260" end="01:30:53.070" style="s2">individual sovereignty right your</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.550" end="01:30:55.050" style="s2">individual capacity for where you are to</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.070" end="01:30:57.150" style="s2">perceive where you are and what is</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.050" end="01:30:58.380" style="s2">needful now and if by the way it turns</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.150" end="01:31:00.570" style="s2">out that you don&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.380" end="01:31:03.690" style="s2">address what was needful now how to</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.570" end="01:31:07.199" style="s2">build that capacity right so learning</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.690" end="01:31:10.469" style="s2">about how to learn and learning about</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.199" end="01:31:11.969" style="s2">how to have the stick with it &#39;no stu be</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.469" end="01:31:13.650" style="s2">able to commit to</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.969" end="01:31:15.329" style="s2">do what you have to learn learning how</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.650" end="01:31:16.320" style="s2">to have emotional resilience to deal</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.329" end="01:31:18.389" style="s2">with circumstances where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.320" end="01:31:21.139" style="s2">overwhelming I&#39;m like really deep</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.389" end="01:31:23.309" style="s2">fundamental core capacities that are</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.139" end="01:31:26.130" style="s2">completely absent from education as we</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.309" end="01:31:28.969" style="s2">currently know it and or if they are</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.130" end="01:31:31.860" style="s2">learned they&#39;re learned willy-nilly and</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.969" end="01:31:34.079" style="s2">are fundamentally applicable under any</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.860" end="01:31:35.820" style="s2">possible circumstance amendments of</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.079" end="01:31:38.329" style="s2">happenings you have a a sovereign being</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.820" end="01:31:40.559" style="s2">who then shows up in a given domain</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.329" end="01:31:42.030" style="s2">rapidly pulls together the specific</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.559" end="01:31:44.340" style="s2">domain specific skills they need to have</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.030" end="01:31:46.590" style="s2">maybe even sub specializes but never</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.340" end="01:31:48.900" style="s2">becomes the subspecialty always</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.590" end="01:31:51.210" style="s2">maintains the integrity of their core</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.900" end="01:31:53.610" style="s2">sovereignty this this was a key thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.210" end="01:31:56.309" style="s2">never becomes it means something at an</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.610" end="01:31:59.030" style="s2">identity level yes that&#39;s right yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.309" end="01:32:02.550" style="s2">am NOT a fire pilot I do fly fighters</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.030" end="01:32:05.369" style="s2">sometimes yeah I&#39;m not a fireman I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.550" end="01:32:07.409" style="s2">a banker I&#39;m not X Y or Z that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.369" end="01:32:09.179" style="s2">something that I do sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.409" end="01:32:11.460" style="s2">something that I it&#39;s a game that I play</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.179" end="01:32:13.499" style="s2">right it&#39;s moving into a state where you</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.460" end="01:32:16.559" style="s2">are not the games you play you play</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.499" end="01:32:20.070" style="s2">games you are not the games you play now</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.559" end="01:32:24.210" style="s2">this was also key bit for most people in</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.070" end="01:32:26.940" style="s2">gaming games already defined like you</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.210" end="01:32:28.409" style="s2">know if you go play most games right you</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.940" end="01:32:29.670" style="s2">go play soccer Monopoly the rules are</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.409" end="01:32:31.469" style="s2">already set and the question is can you</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.670" end="01:32:35.130" style="s2">get good at doing it right when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.469" end="01:32:36.539" style="s2">learning subjects in school the answers</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.130" end="01:32:38.460" style="s2">are already set this clear right and</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.539" end="01:32:39.840" style="s2">wrong can you get do a good job at</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.460" end="01:32:41.550" style="s2">getting that right and then when you go</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.840" end="01:32:42.900" style="s2">work at a company it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.550" end="01:32:44.909" style="s2">right someone else is setting the</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.900" end="01:32:48.119" style="s2">objectives of the company and so you</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.909" end="01:32:51.239" style="s2">mostly have to have a very little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.119" end="01:32:53.789" style="s2">sovereignty within whatever domain space</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.239" end="01:32:56.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t fully specified but towards a goal</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.789" end="01:32:58.199" style="s2">that someone else set and so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.280" end="01:32:59.519" style="s2">have to self assess what needs done and</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.199" end="01:33:01.170" style="s2">how to go about doing it you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.519" end="01:33:03.210" style="s2">trained in a very specific capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.170" end="01:33:05.610" style="s2">do that most people who&#39;ve been trained</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.210" end="01:33:08.579" style="s2">that way so intensely the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.610" end="01:33:09.869" style="s2">assessing what needs done and how to go</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.579" end="01:33:10.800" style="s2">about doing it without someone else</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.869" end="01:33:12.239" style="s2">telling them how to do it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.800" end="01:33:13.650" style="s2">overwhelming yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.239" end="01:33:15.210" style="s2">challenging and I think this is showing</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.650" end="01:33:18.300" style="s2">up more and more and more and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.210" end="01:33:19.739" style="s2">going to show up particularly heavily on</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.300" end="01:33:21.179" style="s2">the other side of the coin which is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.739" end="01:33:24.809" style="s2">people who are in fact obsoleted or</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.179" end="01:33:25.470" style="s2">their identity their skills the thing</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.809" end="01:33:28.950" style="s2">that keeps them</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.470" end="01:33:31.920" style="s2">z is rendered obsolete because in that</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.950" end="01:33:34.160" style="s2">case they are going to feel overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.920" end="01:33:36.150" style="s2">off in a lot of different dimensions and</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.160" end="01:33:37.530" style="s2">it is in fact simply the case that</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.150" end="01:33:39.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going to need to learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.530" end="01:33:41.910" style="s2">come back and begin to self assess</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.000" end="01:33:42.570" style="s2">because you know did the notion that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.910" end="01:33:44.310" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.570" end="01:33:47.010" style="s2">programmatically tell everybody what to</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.310" end="01:33:50.190" style="s2">do is one not very reasonable and to</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.010" end="01:33:51.450" style="s2">terrible if we could pull it off so it</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.190" end="01:33:54.480" style="s2">ends up happening is we have to find a</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.450" end="01:33:56.880" style="s2">way to unmask rebuild that core kernel</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.480" end="01:33:58.350" style="s2">which is ok you know reclaim your</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.880" end="01:34:00.210" style="s2">sovereignty reclaim your ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.350" end="01:34:02.280" style="s2">the choices that are your responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.210" end="01:34:03.720" style="s2">to make and take ownership for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.280" end="01:34:07.080" style="s2">consequences of those choices back out</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.720" end="01:34:09.380" style="s2">in the world which is it turns out by</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.080" end="01:34:11.550" style="s2">the way in terms of like just games is</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.380" end="01:34:13.980" style="s2">actually where fun lives you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.550" end="01:34:17.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a very common experience among</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.980" end="01:34:21.890" style="s2">people who play say video games computer</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.130" end="01:34:24.780" style="s2">games that any game where you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.890" end="01:34:27.300" style="s2">against a machine which is to say where</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.780" end="01:34:29.490" style="s2">the game is ultimately finite it has a</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.300" end="01:34:31.080" style="s2">very specific curve to it where when</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.490" end="01:34:32.490" style="s2">you&#39;re first in it it actually feels</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.080" end="01:34:34.040" style="s2">really fun because you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.490" end="01:34:36.840" style="s2">where it actually kind of feels real</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.040" end="01:34:39.150" style="s2">after some little bit little bit you</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.840" end="01:34:41.910" style="s2">begin to actually understand where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.150" end="01:34:44.310" style="s2">not real and begin to optimize for the</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.910" end="01:34:46.200" style="s2">game aspects and then you actually have</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.310" end="01:34:47.880" style="s2">an accelerating arc of have sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.200" end="01:34:49.950" style="s2">a visceral response because now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.880" end="01:34:51.330" style="s2">winning you can actually win the game no</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.950" end="01:34:53.280" style="s2">longer Nolan are you playing the game</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.330" end="01:34:55.080" style="s2">you&#39;re now winning the game but at a</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.280" end="01:34:56.580" style="s2">certain point you&#39;ve become so good at</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.080" end="01:34:58.380" style="s2">winning the game that you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.580" end="01:34:59.520" style="s2">get any kind of visceral feedback from</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.380" end="01:35:02.010" style="s2">winning the game it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.520" end="01:35:04.680" style="s2">interesting because he&#39;s now gamed the</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.010" end="01:35:07.130" style="s2">game and achieving certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.680" end="01:35:09.630" style="s2">characteristics like getting scores</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.130" end="01:35:11.580" style="s2">becomes of diminishing returns and this</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.630" end="01:35:13.350" style="s2">by the way is true of any finite domain</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.580" end="01:35:14.970" style="s2">right when you first enter into the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.350" end="01:35:16.680" style="s2">finite domain the act of exploring is</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.970" end="01:35:18.390" style="s2">really interesting and fulfilling then</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.680" end="01:35:19.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve optimized you found out what the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.390" end="01:35:21.420" style="s2">shape of the domain is and what kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.800" end="01:35:23.730" style="s2">things work or don&#39;t work so then the</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.420" end="01:35:25.380" style="s2">act of optimizing has a visceral</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.730" end="01:35:27.240" style="s2">response because that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.380" end="01:35:30.720" style="s2">where the rewards come but if you become</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.240" end="01:35:32.340" style="s2">that thing that&#39;s optimizing then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.720" end="01:35:33.930" style="s2">now locked into a circumstance where at</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.340" end="01:35:35.580" style="s2">some point you&#39;re going to go over the</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.930" end="01:35:37.800" style="s2">top of the curve and now you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.580" end="01:35:39.000" style="s2">diminishing returns and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.800" end="01:35:41.100" style="s2">point is if you become</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.000" end="01:35:44.430" style="s2">thing he&#39;s actually lost the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.100" end="01:35:46.290" style="s2">move out and jump into other kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.430" end="01:35:49.430" style="s2">games willy-nilly or play games that</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.290" end="01:35:49.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have those characteristics at all</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.700" end="01:35:57.750" style="s2">so when we think about optimizing humans</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.560" end="01:36:01.590" style="s2">for sovereignty so that they could move</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.750" end="01:36:03.870" style="s2">between doing fighter pilot or making</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.590" end="01:36:05.580" style="s2">love or raising a baby or assessing a</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.870" end="01:36:07.290" style="s2">totally foreign environment or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.580" end="01:36:09.150" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.290" end="01:36:11.100" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.150" end="01:36:13.350" style="s2">involved and you also started in terms</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.100" end="01:36:14.780" style="s2">of how to learn new skills</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.350" end="01:36:17.940" style="s2">right there&#39;s meta education</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.780" end="01:36:19.590" style="s2">epistemology how do I assess when I need</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.940" end="01:36:22.140" style="s2">a new skill how do I go about learning</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.590" end="01:36:24.150" style="s2">new skills well you know there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.140" end="01:36:25.230" style="s2">that but you also said one has to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.150" end="01:36:26.700" style="s2">able to deal with the emotions that</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.230" end="01:36:28.860" style="s2">arise in new environment so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.700" end="01:36:32.310" style="s2">emotional skills and personal skills and</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.860" end="01:36:34.080" style="s2">then you know we also related the topic</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.310" end="01:36:37.350" style="s2">of medicine and healthcare to this and</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.080" end="01:36:39.000" style="s2">that we move from just a sick care model</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.350" end="01:36:40.980" style="s2">to a sovereignty optimization where</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.000" end="01:36:42.990" style="s2">people&#39;s physiology in their states and</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.980" end="01:36:44.280" style="s2">their ability to address it is also part</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.990" end="01:36:46.470" style="s2">of that so</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.280" end="01:36:48.960" style="s2">and obviously with neuro hacker we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.470" end="01:36:53.430" style="s2">starting to look at mind brain right</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.960" end="01:36:56.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a goal there so what we talked</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.430" end="01:36:58.530" style="s2">earlier about how things like economics</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.340" end="01:37:01.950" style="s2">and like macro world things affect</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.530" end="01:37:04.380" style="s2">people&#39;s health through advertising</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.950" end="01:37:06.120" style="s2">dynamics that are sending the hyper</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.380" end="01:37:08.580" style="s2">normal stimuli of sugar all the time</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.120" end="01:37:11.340" style="s2">right through martini but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.580" end="01:37:14.940" style="s2">this other side of do people&#39;s physical</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.340" end="01:37:17.580" style="s2">health well-being affect macro dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.940" end="01:37:20.460" style="s2">and if so how and how is that part of</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.580" end="01:37:23.160" style="s2">the sovereignty optimization I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.460" end="01:37:26.220" style="s2">understand that to me ask that again so</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.160" end="01:37:27.810" style="s2">you mean all the lines of does the</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.220" end="01:37:30.180" style="s2">population where everybody in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.810" end="01:37:33.500" style="s2">population is depressed show up for</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.180" end="01:37:36.000" style="s2">example in different politics yes okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.500" end="01:37:38.040" style="s2">defines different consumption patterns</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.000" end="01:37:40.380" style="s2">crime patterns whatever right I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.040" end="01:37:42.090" style="s2">obviously the way that I asked that</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.380" end="01:37:46.530" style="s2">question makes it pretty easy to answer</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.090" end="01:37:49.140" style="s2">the answer is obviously yes and it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.530" end="01:37:51.900" style="s2">it like we can do it like all the way</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.140" end="01:37:52.980" style="s2">down so let&#39;s say for example you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.900" end="01:37:57.470" style="s2">somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.980" end="01:38:03.000" style="s2">as a particular objective response to</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.470" end="01:38:04.650" style="s2">anxiety where you eat food because the</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.000" end="01:38:06.000" style="s2">the visceral activating of food causes</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.650" end="01:38:08.520" style="s2">your body to have certain dumps of</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.000" end="01:38:10.170" style="s2">endorphins and serotonin levels go up</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.520" end="01:38:12.060" style="s2">and so therefore you your anxiety levels</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.170" end="01:38:13.650" style="s2">ambiently feel like they go down and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.060" end="01:38:17.250" style="s2">you more or less feel like you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.650" end="01:38:19.260" style="s2">into being okay so then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.250" end="01:38:21.900" style="s2">have the characteristic of overeating</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.260" end="01:38:23.130" style="s2">well interesting enough if lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.900" end="01:38:25.200" style="s2">of people have that characteristic then</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.130" end="01:38:27.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have an economy that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.200" end="01:38:28.710" style="s2">going to be into optimized for those</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.000" end="01:38:30.600" style="s2">kinds of choices which is bizarre like</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.710" end="01:38:32.489" style="s2">you have both of a feedback loop on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.600" end="01:38:33.960" style="s2">one hand people who have an addiction to</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.489" end="01:38:36.300" style="s2">that particular approach to dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.960" end="01:38:38.370" style="s2">anxiety are actually generating a real</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.300" end="01:38:41.030" style="s2">economic signal of I want more things</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.370" end="01:38:43.500" style="s2">that are subject to overeating and</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.030" end="01:38:45.000" style="s2">therefore the food artifacts that do</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.500" end="01:38:48.120" style="s2">actually satisfy that addiction well</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.000" end="01:38:51.360" style="s2">like say potato chips and on the other</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.120" end="01:38:52.860" style="s2">side you have a manipulation media and</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.360" end="01:38:55.110" style="s2">advertising infrastructure that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.860" end="01:38:56.700" style="s2">incentivized to push people into domains</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.110" end="01:38:58.590" style="s2">that are likely to be triggered by that</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.700" end="01:39:00.150" style="s2">particular addictive response because</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.590" end="01:39:01.530" style="s2">that will maximize their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.150" end="01:39:04.020" style="s2">generate profits on the products they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.530" end="01:39:07.170" style="s2">already spent time investing in that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.020" end="01:39:08.550" style="s2">really bad feedback loop and then you</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.170" end="01:39:09.540" style="s2">can imagine that in say for example</p>

<p begin="01:39:12.720" end="01:39:16.110" style="s2">this feedback loop then you&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="01:39:34.610" end="01:39:38.040" style="s2">suicidal meaning you have to actually</p>

<p begin="01:39:51.390" end="01:39:54.510" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that no given</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.530" end="01:39:56.070" style="s2">individual agent acting on their own is</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.510" end="01:39:59.280" style="s2">likely going to be able to resolve that</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.070" end="01:40:00.630" style="s2">problem and the game dynamics are if you</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.280" end="01:40:03.750" style="s2">do the thing that&#39;s good for the whole</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.630" end="01:40:05.130" style="s2">and bad for you you lose and so over</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.750" end="01:40:06.079" style="s2">time iteratively there are a few people</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.130" end="01:40:08.389" style="s2">fear of your</p>

<p begin="01:40:10.460" end="01:40:14.360" style="s2">or the lie that&#39;s right yeah and so it</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.040" end="01:40:17.480" style="s2">ends up happening now if you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.360" end="01:40:20.599" style="s2">that at a neurological level you spend</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.480" end="01:40:22.670" style="s2">to say ten hours a day in a space where</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.599" end="01:40:25.250" style="s2">you&#39;re combining a variation as if</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.670" end="01:40:27.199" style="s2">sociopathy and delusion you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.250" end="01:40:29.929" style="s2">gonna have congenital neurological</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.199" end="01:40:31.250" style="s2">changes which are going to show up in</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.929" end="01:40:32.270" style="s2">all the rest of the ways that you show</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.250" end="01:40:33.619" style="s2">up in life so you&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.270" end="01:40:34.849" style="s2">weird relationship with your spouse</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.619" end="01:40:36.320" style="s2">you&#39;re going from weird relations with</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.849" end="01:40:38.090" style="s2">your kids you&#39;re gonna make weird</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.320" end="01:40:40.550" style="s2">choices in politics you&#39;re a risk I mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.090" end="01:40:41.869" style="s2">it&#39;s just going to continue to go which</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.550" end="01:40:43.040" style="s2">is not that different than saying for</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.869" end="01:40:45.230" style="s2">example if you had an entire population</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.040" end="01:40:48.199" style="s2">that was addicted to opium an entire</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.230" end="01:40:50.059" style="s2">population that was sort of functionally</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.199" end="01:40:53.630" style="s2">alcoholic which by the way is you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.059" end="01:40:54.800" style="s2">the medieval medieval Europe could be</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.630" end="01:40:57.230" style="s2">characterized as an entire population</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.800" end="01:41:00.949" style="s2">who are functionally alcoholic and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.230" end="01:41:01.940" style="s2">think pre like mid 19th century giant</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.949" end="01:41:03.889" style="s2">parts of America had the same</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.940" end="01:41:06.139" style="s2">characteristics so we can run this at a</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.889" end="01:41:08.929" style="s2">neuro at a physiological level we can</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.139" end="01:41:11.150" style="s2">run at a behavioral level I&#39;m gonna run</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.929" end="01:41:13.010" style="s2">it the feedback loops between them but</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.150" end="01:41:14.150" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s important to take</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.010" end="01:41:16.489" style="s2">into account the fact that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.150" end="01:41:18.199" style="s2">case and then think about what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.489" end="01:41:20.329" style="s2">believers again keep coming back to the</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.199" end="01:41:21.949" style="s2">same notion of when you see the whole</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.329" end="01:41:25.849" style="s2">you see how all the pieces feed back on</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.949" end="01:41:27.139" style="s2">each other it is in fact just necessary</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.849" end="01:41:28.610" style="s2">chose to be thoughtful on how they</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.139" end="01:41:30.980" style="s2">feedback on each other and how does one</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.610" end="01:41:32.719" style="s2">begin to engage in this struggle process</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.980" end="01:41:34.880" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think by the way is</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.719" end="01:41:37.010" style="s2">actually sort of intrinsically harder</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.880" end="01:41:37.940" style="s2">than other things that we do well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.010" end="01:41:39.710" style="s2">just not something we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.940" end="01:41:42.380" style="s2">developed a lot of skillfulness in yet I</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.710" end="01:41:46.190" style="s2">think that the practice of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.380" end="01:41:48.290" style="s2">be perceptive of how many many various</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.190" end="01:41:50.000" style="s2">systems operate and being able to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.290" end="01:41:51.829" style="s2">skillful in shifting them in desired</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.000" end="01:41:53.869" style="s2">ways is actually just something that we</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.829" end="01:41:56.000" style="s2">need to build skill at I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.869" end="01:41:59.510" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is obviously beyond</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.000" end="01:42:01.400" style="s2">our capacities okay so I want to restate</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.510" end="01:42:03.110" style="s2">and underline something that Jordan just</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.400" end="01:42:04.579" style="s2">said for everyone listening because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.110" end="01:42:07.360" style="s2">so key he&#39;s talking about the feedback</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.579" end="01:42:10.190" style="s2">loops here so wait is it the demand</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.360" end="01:42:12.710" style="s2">drives supply or is it that supply</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.190" end="01:42:14.869" style="s2">drives demand it&#39;s very much both and</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.710" end="01:42:17.389" style="s2">it&#39;s really critical to get that of</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.869" end="01:42:19.320" style="s2">course originally demand Drive supply</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.389" end="01:42:20.880" style="s2">more people want something and supply</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.320" end="01:42:23.579" style="s2">steps up but then you have a real source</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.880" end="01:42:24.989" style="s2">of supply and you want to manufacture</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.579" end="01:42:26.280" style="s2">you want to protect the demand because</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.989" end="01:42:28.409" style="s2">otherwise your business goes out and</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.280" end="01:42:30.420" style="s2">maybe manufacture more demand and that</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.409" end="01:42:32.550" style="s2">looks like marketing that looks like</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.420" end="01:42:34.770" style="s2">whatever - great manufactured demand so</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.550" end="01:42:36.090" style="s2">supply is driving demand demand is</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.770" end="01:42:38.130" style="s2">driving supply and you can get feedback</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.090" end="01:42:40.230" style="s2">loops that move in the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.130" end="01:42:42.949" style="s2">right move in the direction of society</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.230" end="01:42:47.190" style="s2">as a whole getting worse and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.949" end="01:42:49.739" style="s2">similarly we have dynamics where you</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.190" end="01:42:52.199" style="s2">know this very much just addressed one</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.739" end="01:42:54.840" style="s2">of the core differences between what the</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.199" end="01:42:58.739" style="s2">rational left-right argument has largely</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.840" end="01:43:00.869" style="s2">been about the is the individual do</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.739" end="01:43:02.070" style="s2">individuals create the whole so you want</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.869" end="01:43:03.719" style="s2">to optimize for the sovereignty of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.070" end="01:43:05.010" style="s2">individuals or the individuals affected</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.719" end="01:43:06.300" style="s2">by the whole so you want to make good</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.010" end="01:43:09.119" style="s2">social systems that make good</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.300" end="01:43:11.130" style="s2">individuals and it&#39;s very much both and</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.119" end="01:43:12.599" style="s2">so you want to make good educational</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.130" end="01:43:14.130" style="s2">systems good economic systems that</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.599" end="01:43:16.190" style="s2">condition better people you also want to</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.130" end="01:43:19.199" style="s2">make more sovereign people that lead to</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.190" end="01:43:20.849" style="s2">better whole systems but when we start</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.199" end="01:43:23.460" style="s2">thinking about these feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.849" end="01:43:25.889" style="s2">the same is true with if someone is in</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.460" end="01:43:27.599" style="s2">an economic system that&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.889" end="01:43:29.159" style="s2">certain kinds of stress and certain</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.599" end="01:43:31.710" style="s2">kinds of behavior does that affect their</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.159" end="01:43:35.520" style="s2">brain and their health yes but if we</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.710" end="01:43:37.560" style="s2">also are - someone&#39;s what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.520" end="01:43:39.360" style="s2">with their diet and with their</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.560" end="01:43:41.190" style="s2">physicality that&#39;s affecting their brain</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.360" end="01:43:42.929" style="s2">and health and affect the decisions that</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.190" end="01:43:46.469" style="s2">they make in the world yes it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.929" end="01:43:48.300" style="s2">much both and so mine brain interface is</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.469" end="01:43:50.790" style="s2">a classic one like supply and demand</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.300" end="01:43:51.929" style="s2">like individual and collective and to</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.790" end="01:43:53.429" style="s2">really get the basins of attraction</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.929" end="01:43:55.290" style="s2">right we have to not think about</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.429" end="01:43:57.929" style="s2">either-or we have to think about the</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.290" end="01:44:00.300" style="s2">synergies and the feedback loops yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.929" end="01:44:02.699" style="s2">this reminds me actually but what I</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.300" end="01:44:04.070" style="s2">noticed and I hadn&#39;t expected to be the</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.699" end="01:44:08.820" style="s2">case but I noticed that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.070" end="01:44:11.550" style="s2">reasonably common misconception coming</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.820" end="01:44:14.460" style="s2">back from from people about neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.550" end="01:44:18.750" style="s2">which was because we had specifically</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.460" end="01:44:20.940" style="s2">focused on the physiological you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.750" end="01:44:23.449" style="s2">body mind a body brain pieced the</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.940" end="01:44:25.860" style="s2">equation that somehow we were also</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.449" end="01:44:27.599" style="s2">collapsing the entire space down to just</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.860" end="01:44:29.699" style="s2">that one thing right so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.599" end="01:44:31.139" style="s2">saying hey this is the the elixir of all</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.699" end="01:44:32.500" style="s2">good things and just do this everything</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.139" end="01:44:34.240" style="s2">will be okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.500" end="01:44:36.850" style="s2">when in fact of quarters obviously that</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.240" end="01:44:38.340" style="s2">can&#39;t be the case that every single</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.850" end="01:44:41.800" style="s2">component of all behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.340" end="01:44:43.260" style="s2">interpersonal social cognitive and many</p>

<p begin="01:44:45.100" end="01:44:49.530" style="s2">achieve well-being you have to learn how</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.890" end="01:44:51.280" style="s2">to eat right you have to learn how to</p>

<p begin="01:45:24.430" end="01:45:29.500" style="s2">way back down to core capacities because</p>

<p begin="01:45:29.500" end="01:45:32.920" style="s2">you have them and if you do have them</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.030" end="01:45:34.600" style="s2">your ability respond to all of them</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.920" end="01:45:36.700" style="s2">basically just becomes fungible yeah</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.600" end="01:45:39.610" style="s2">they&#39;re more or less domain and in</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.700" end="01:45:41.170" style="s2">specific and then there was actually</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.610" end="01:45:44.530" style="s2">something that came to me as you were</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.170" end="01:45:46.180" style="s2">describing as you were talking a few</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.530" end="01:45:47.320" style="s2">moments ago that I thought in the path</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.180" end="01:45:52.030" style="s2">that I thought might be very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.320" end="01:45:54.910" style="s2">to share and said in an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.030" end="01:45:57.000" style="s2">language so you know in traditional</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.910" end="01:46:00.040" style="s2">evolution you have you have an organism</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.000" end="01:46:02.200" style="s2">and you have the the landscape or the</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.040" end="01:46:04.780" style="s2">ecosystem which that organism is</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.200" end="01:46:08.260" style="s2">existing and the basic idea is that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.780" end="01:46:11.410" style="s2">the organism is is striving to be fifth</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.260" end="01:46:13.690" style="s2">meaning had to compete for scarce</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.410" end="01:46:15.760" style="s2">resources which may be its own body</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.690" end="01:46:20.500" style="s2">against predators and be able to</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.760" end="01:46:22.210" style="s2">reproduce and one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.500" end="01:46:25.000" style="s2">things that exist in the organisms</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.210" end="01:46:28.390" style="s2">portfolio of actions is a concept called</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.000" end="01:46:31.390" style="s2">niche production and so if you happen to</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.390" end="01:46:32.050" style="s2">be say really really good at thriving in</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.390" end="01:46:34.450" style="s2">the swamp</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.050" end="01:46:36.340" style="s2">if you have the capacity to turn more of</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.450" end="01:46:40.780" style="s2">the world into swamp that&#39;s to your</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.340" end="01:46:43.990" style="s2">local advantage but of course it turns</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.780" end="01:46:45.790" style="s2">out there&#39;s a problem that if you become</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.990" end="01:46:47.590" style="s2">so capable of constrain</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.790" end="01:46:49.240" style="s2">controlling your environment that you</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.590" end="01:46:52.030" style="s2">lose your individual adaptive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.240" end="01:46:53.410" style="s2">then if and when something happens that</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.030" end="01:46:54.970" style="s2">pushes the environment out of your</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.410" end="01:46:57.100" style="s2">control so the swamp transitive desert</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.970" end="01:46:59.050" style="s2">you&#39;re just dead alright so there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.100" end="01:47:01.150" style="s2">interesting balance between niche</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.050" end="01:47:03.130" style="s2">construction and intrinsic adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.150" end="01:47:05.350" style="s2">capacity but there&#39;s actually even a</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.130" end="01:47:09.520" style="s2">higher-order synthesis between those two</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.350" end="01:47:10.810" style="s2">which we may actually just be humans may</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.520" end="01:47:14.020" style="s2">just be uniquely entering to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.810" end="01:47:15.940" style="s2">possibility of proceeding and doing and</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.020" end="01:47:18.520" style="s2">in fact may actually be necessary that</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.940" end="01:47:20.980" style="s2">we do it which is if you can come to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.520" end="01:47:23.170" style="s2">point where you can actually have full</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.980" end="01:47:25.660" style="s2">responsibility for your individual</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.170" end="01:47:27.550" style="s2">well-being and for the enduring</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.660" end="01:47:31.900" style="s2">well-being of the niche in which you</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.550" end="01:47:34.600" style="s2">live and now as as an organism you are</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.900" end="01:47:37.180" style="s2">no longer evolving in a niche you and</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.600" end="01:47:39.310" style="s2">your niche are in fact co-evolved such</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.180" end="01:47:40.510" style="s2">that the integrity between the two is</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.310" end="01:47:43.270" style="s2">fully maintained meaning that your niche</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.510" end="01:47:45.100" style="s2">does better the better you do and you do</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.270" end="01:47:48.810" style="s2">better the better your niche does that</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.100" end="01:47:50.770" style="s2">has an endurance characteristic that</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.810" end="01:47:56.200" style="s2">cannot be achieved through any other</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.770" end="01:47:58.930" style="s2">evolutionary strategy mmhmm yep</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.200" end="01:48:01.150" style="s2">and I think that is a great place to</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.930" end="01:48:03.100" style="s2">leave this one on because we have went</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.150" end="01:48:09.880" style="s2">long here and covered a lot of territory</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.100" end="01:48:12.580" style="s2">from economics and then crypto economics</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.880" end="01:48:15.610" style="s2">and blockchain to education healthcare</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.580" end="01:48:18.400" style="s2">medicine sovereignty niche construction</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.610" end="01:48:20.200" style="s2">versus intrinsic adaptiveness so I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.400" end="01:48:25.650" style="s2">this will be a fun one for people to</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.200" end="01:48:25.650" style="s2">figure out how to make sure notes of and</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.300" end="01:48:33.190" style="s2">if anyone wants to see more of Jordans</p>
