<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:09.870" style="s2">We’re gonna review a proposition.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.870" end="00:00:15.490" style="s2">Now, if I ever tell you something in enough<br />detail that you&#39;ve already heard that you’ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.490" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">heard it enough, please tell me because I<br />can’t precisely remember what I told you.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">I know the line of the narrative throughout<br />the entire course, and we will return to some</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">things fairly frequently, but I don&#39;t want<br />to tell you the same story three times, unless</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">you’re particularly compelled by that story.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:38.080" style="s2">So let me know.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.080" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">We’re going to start with a proposition,<br />and the proposition is that in order to orient</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:50.630" style="s2">yourself properly in life, there&#39;s two classes<br />of information you have to have access to.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.630" end="00:00:56.530" style="s2">One class of information is information about<br />the nature of the objective world, and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.530" end="00:01:01.789" style="s2">objective world is described in a manner - or<br />the world when it is treated objectively - is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.789" end="00:01:06.070" style="s2">described in a manner that strips all the<br />subjectivity from it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.070" end="00:01:08.100" style="s2">That’s the technology.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.100" end="00:01:14.590" style="s2">The philosophical technology that&#39;s behind<br />the Scientific Revolution - involves stripping</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.590" end="00:01:22.980" style="s2">the subjectivity from the sense mediated consequences<br />of certain kinds of actions because when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.980" end="00:01:26.720" style="s2">lay out an experiment, you&#39;re not just talking<br />about what happened, you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.720" end="00:01:29.020" style="s2">what you did and then what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.020" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">And you&#39;re supposed to be able to do it in<br />a way that ensures that if someone else followed</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:36.700" style="s2">the exact same procedure, they would obviously<br />observe the same consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.700" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">And, in some sense, we’re trying to establish<br />a realm of knowledge that is universally applicable</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">to people despite their individual differences.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:50.160" style="s2">That&#39;s one way of thinking about it, and obviously<br />that works.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.160" end="00:01:56.060" style="s2">Whether or not it works in a Darwinian sense,<br />we still have to determine because it could</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.060" end="00:02:03.231" style="s2">easily be that our development of the scientific<br />method is what will make us go extinct, under</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.231" end="00:02:06.759" style="s2">which circumstances you might consider it<br />to have been an error.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.759" end="00:02:14.570" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t really matter at the moment<br />because so far so good, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.570" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">Now, people think the world is an objective<br />place because we can describe it objectively,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:25.030" style="s2">and that&#39;s a much more debatable presupposition.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.030" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">It’s partly debatable because it&#39;s actually<br />based on a decision in some sense, rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">than evidence, partly because your knowledge<br />is finite in every direction in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:43.370" style="s2">So what that means in a way is no matter what<br />you know about anything, you don&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.370" end="00:02:44.620" style="s2">about that thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.620" end="00:02:47.350" style="s2">And so, you kind of ground out in ignorance<br />at some point.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.350" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2">So what means is you that you have to buttress<br />your thinking with a set of assumptions that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:55.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t question or you just end up in an<br />infinite regress.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.600" end="00:03:02.660" style="s2">One of those sets of assumptions is usually<br />reality definition sets of assumptions, or</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.660" end="00:03:07.379" style="s2">truth definition sets of assumptions, but<br />the thing is generally no matter what your</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.379" end="00:03:12.150" style="s2">theory of reality is, or what your theory<br />of truth is, there are alternative theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.150" end="00:03:17.379" style="s2">of reality and alternative theories of truth<br />that are equally rigorous and that have different</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.379" end="00:03:19.370" style="s2">domains of application.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.370" end="00:03:30.629" style="s2">And it’s a very tricky business, so for<br />example, if you&#39;re a reductionist materialist,</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.629" end="00:03:39.340" style="s2">you&#39;re going to make the presupposition that<br />brain physiology is more real than emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.340" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">experience.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s in some sense because you<br />can&#39;t get access to someone else’s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">experiences, at least not directly whereas<br />you can get universal access to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">details of someone’s brain physiology.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:53.490" style="s2">It’s something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.490" end="00:04:00.110" style="s2">Anyways now, that&#39;s still an arbitrary assumption<br />because the person and you as well are going</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.110" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">to be acting all the time as if your emotions<br />and motivational states are real and so then</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:09.379" style="s2">you run into a problem and the problem is<br />well, how do you know what someone actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.379" end="00:04:10.379" style="s2">believes?</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.379" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">You listen to what they say or do you listen<br />to their explicit and well articulated theories,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">or do you watch how they act?</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">And the answer to that is, you make your choice<br />and generally there are reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:35.870" style="s2">Now, one of the conceptual tools that I have<br />found helpful in my attempts to avoid confusion</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:39.310" style="s2">when dealing with the fact that there are<br />very many ways of looking at the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.310" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">to start thinking about theories of reality<br />as tools rather than descriptions and I find</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">that extraordinarily useful as a metaphor.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">If you have a toolbox full of tools, you don&#39;t<br />necessarily try to reduce the utility of one</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">tool to another and you don&#39;t actually complain<br />that all tools aren&#39;t the same.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">A wrench isn&#39;t a very good hammer, but that<br />doesn&#39;t mean you can criticize it on that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:06.199" style="s2">grounds.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.199" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">You might not want to use it as a hammer,<br />although you could I suppose, but it’s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:15.061" style="s2">a justifiable criticism, and it looks to me<br />- and this is something that a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.061" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">named George Kelly pointed out as well, although<br />I think it’s also an element of pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:26.090" style="s2">philosophy is that one set of tools for one<br />thing, and another set of tools for another</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.090" end="00:05:27.480" style="s2">thing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.480" end="00:05:33.040" style="s2">That’s helpful, that’s helpful.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.040" end="00:05:36.699" style="s2">And then you are also thinking about the sorts<br />of problems that you might solve with different</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.699" end="00:05:41.960" style="s2">forms of tools, and one problem is what are<br />things made of - in an objective sense let’s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.960" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">say.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:48.979" style="s2">And another problem might be what is the landscape<br />of experience, and that&#39;s more of a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.979" end="00:05:49.979" style="s2">problem.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.979" end="00:05:52.150" style="s2">That’s the problem the phenomenologists<br />set out, and then the other problem might</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.150" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">be how do you, and should you conduct yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:03.699" style="s2">And it could easily be that you can&#39;t use<br />the same tool to solve all of those problems,</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.699" end="00:06:09.310" style="s2">and I would say particularly true, technically,<br />when you&#39;re dealing with science because science</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.310" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">in its very nature refuses to answer questions<br />about what it is that you should do, apart</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:18.919" style="s2">from some implicit assumption that you should<br />do science which is actually not -</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.919" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2">Well that’s actually not a scientific assumption,<br />by the way, because it’s a moral assumption,</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.770" end="00:06:30.300" style="s2">and the moral assumption is that if you conduct<br />yourself in a scientific manner, things will</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.300" end="00:06:34.970" style="s2">be better because why would you run around<br />doing science to make things worse, although</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.970" end="00:06:37.319" style="s2">you absolutely can.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.319" end="00:06:43.210" style="s2">And, we perhaps are, and even if we aren’t,<br />we still might.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.210" end="00:06:47.819" style="s2">So that&#39;s one of the things I find quite interesting<br />about the scientific endeavor, and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.819" end="00:06:52.090" style="s2">something Jung observed was that it had to<br />be nested in something outside of itself to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.090" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">be given its motive force.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.130" end="00:06:58.669" style="s2">It had to be nested in a system of moral assumptions,<br />and the fundamental moral assumption is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.669" end="00:07:02.819" style="s2">world will be a better place if we conduct<br />ourselves along scientific lines, because</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.819" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">why do it?</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:08.690" style="s2">And that&#39;s a statement that cannot be analyzed<br />from within the confines of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.690" end="00:07:12.100" style="s2">worldview because it doesn&#39;t analyze those<br />sorts of questions.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.100" end="00:07:17.500" style="s2">Now, you can say they&#39;re not real, but that&#39;s<br />a stupid answer because - I think it’s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.500" end="00:07:20.440" style="s2">cop out, maybe it’s not a stupid answers,<br />but it probably is.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.440" end="00:07:26.110" style="s2">At least it’s a cop out because if you don&#39;t<br />take that question seriously, you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.110" end="00:07:28.440" style="s2">justify engaging in the activity.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.440" end="00:07:32.020" style="s2">So you could refuse to answer it but you&#39;re<br />basically answering it by engaging in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.020" end="00:07:39.789" style="s2">activity anyways so even if you&#39;re not saying<br />it, you&#39;re still justifying it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.789" end="00:07:43.310" style="s2">Assuming you can draw conclusions from people’s<br />actions like you can from their statements</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.310" end="00:07:46.120" style="s2">- and it’s hard to really dispute that I<br />would say.</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.120" end="00:07:51.230" style="s2">If you&#39;re wise, in fact, I think you derive<br />more conclusions from their actions than their</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.230" end="00:07:52.620" style="s2">statements.</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.620" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">So that’s the underbelly of the first proposition,<br />and the development of that is something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.229" end="00:08:08.710" style="s2">the means by which information is transmitted<br />that is relevant to the domain of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.710" end="00:08:13.970" style="s2">is not the same means by which it’s transmitted<br />- by which scientific information is transmitted.</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.970" end="00:08:20.199" style="s2">And we kinda know that too, without any real<br />debate, I believe, because how old do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.199" end="00:08:23.319" style="s2">think science is as a technical endeavor?</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.319" end="00:08:28.520" style="s2">What would you estimate?</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.520" end="00:08:32.079" style="s2">Hundreds of years.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.079" end="00:08:35.740" style="s2">Maybe thousands of years if you’re willing<br />to give the Greeks some credit, but really</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.740" end="00:08:36.810" style="s2">probably not.</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.810" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">Probably hundreds because Aristotle wasn&#39;t<br />a scientist - like he wasn&#39;t a bad observer,</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">but he certainly wasn&#39;t an empirical observer,<br />and no one got science straightened out till</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:51.970" style="s2">what - Newton, Descartes, Bacon, and you know<br />there&#39;s a handful of other characters who</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.970" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">were thinking around that period of time.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:09:00.380" style="s2">They sort of established the proper methods,<br />really, and also the philosophy that underlies</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.380" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:02.380" style="s2">It’s not very old.</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:03.380" style="s2">Six hundred years, you know, five hundred<br />years.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.380" end="00:09:04.380" style="s2">That’s really nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.380" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">It’s the blink of an eye.</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">It’s yesterday, if that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:11.780" style="s2">It might even be an hour ago.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.780" end="00:09:17.422" style="s2">It’s nothing, but obviously people were<br />transmitting information about how to act</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.422" end="00:09:24.280" style="s2">to each other for untold millennia before<br />that, and it’s probably more like - it depends</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.280" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">on what you&#39;re willing to consider transmission<br />of information, but even octopi couldn&#39;t imitate,</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:34.670" style="s2">and they&#39;re the smartest invertebrate.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.670" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">They’re quite bright, those things.</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.150" end="00:09:41.649" style="s2">They only live a couple of years so they can&#39;t<br />really get things going.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.649" end="00:09:42.649" style="s2">They can problem solve.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.649" end="00:09:46.100" style="s2">They can pull corks out of bottles to get<br />like a crab in a bottle, and if they watch</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.100" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">an octopus - if an octopus watches another<br />octopus pull a cork out of a bottle to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:56.390" style="s2">a tasty crab, then that octopus knows how<br />to do it, which is pretty impressive.</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.390" end="00:10:00.740" style="s2">And you could kind of see why octopi can kind<br />of do that because not only do they have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.740" end="00:10:04.550" style="s2">brain, but they also have little tentacle-y<br />appendages which allow them to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.550" end="00:10:05.550" style="s2">things.</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.550" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">So, one of the precursors to being able to<br />be intelligent in any act of way is that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">have to have tentacle-y appendages so you<br />can manipulate the world.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">At least for it to be anything resembling<br />what we would consider to be intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:23.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of the reason dolphins aren&#39;t<br />really as intelligent as people like to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.820" end="00:10:25.370" style="s2">because what are they gonna do?</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.370" end="00:10:27.710" style="s2">They can&#39;t build cities with their flippers.</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.710" end="00:10:33.070" style="s2">They&#39;re kinda trapped in their test tube bodies,<br />and the same thing applies to whales.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.070" end="00:10:37.810" style="s2">Obviously they have very large brains, and<br />they&#39;re very social, and they can learn, but</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.810" end="00:10:41.700" style="s2">whatever their intelligence is, it’s not<br />like our intelligence because we run around</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.700" end="00:10:46.760" style="s2">tearing things apart and putting them back<br />together and we’ve got the body for that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.760" end="00:10:51.860" style="s2">So anyways, long before we were practicing<br />science, we were doing perfectly well, in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.860" end="00:10:56.370" style="s2">a sense, without any real knowledge of the<br />objective world at all - at least not any</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">scientific knowledge about the objective world.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:03.649" style="s2">So another thing you might observe about that<br />is that you can survive perfectly well without</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.649" end="00:11:08.120" style="s2">knowing any science at all, in an articulated<br />and developed manner.</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.120" end="00:11:11.029" style="s2">Of course animals are in that category.</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.029" end="00:11:17.160" style="s2">So, that also, I think in some sense, undermines<br />the claim of science to anything approaching</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.160" end="00:11:21.750" style="s2">a universal truth because obviously life can<br />get along perfectly well without it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.750" end="00:11:24.341" style="s2">Now it depends on some degree whether you’re<br />a Darwinian or a Newtonian.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.341" end="00:11:25.341" style="s2">Perhaps the unwillingness to commence on what<br />people should do is one feature of modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.341" end="00:11:46.770" style="s2">science than it is of science in general because<br />I’m thinking someone like Clifford.</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.770" end="00:11:49.950" style="s2">I don’t know if you know his essay on belief.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.950" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">I don’t, no.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">Oh okay, well his maxim is that basically<br />it’s wrong always for anyone everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:11:59.740" style="s2">to believe anything on his push to evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.740" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">And he sort of tries to prove it - he’s<br />a mathematician.</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:04.510" style="s2">He tries to prove it on a moral basis.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.510" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">Of course, it’s not scientific.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.779" style="s2">That kind of claim can’t be scientific but<br />Yeah, well I mean obviously the people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.779" end="00:12:15.029" style="s2">began the Scientific Revolution thought of<br />it as part of a moral movement.</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.029" end="00:12:16.740" style="s2">I mean it was part of the enlightenment.</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.740" end="00:12:23.029" style="s2">It was part of bringing clarity to our conceptualizations<br />of the world and that was supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.029" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">positive thing, but the only issue is that<br />claim seems to be outside of the claim on</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:30.649" style="s2">science, in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.649" end="00:12:33.649" style="s2">Anyways, you get the picture with regard to<br />the argument.</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.649" end="00:12:44.200" style="s2">Okay, now the next step might be if you need<br />or can utilize or there exists information</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.200" end="00:12:50.170" style="s2">that is not strictly scientific, one might<br />be, well, where did that information come</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:51.170" style="s2">from?</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.170" end="00:12:52.170" style="s2">That&#39;s a good one.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.170" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2">How is it transmitted?</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:54.649" style="s2">That&#39;s another one.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.649" end="00:12:58.860" style="s2">And the worst of it is, of course, how might<br />it be verified?</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.860" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">Because one of the issues - one of the things<br />that scientists have really got down, and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:07.471" style="s2">it’s a major deal, is that they can lay<br />forth a theory of truth and they they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.471" end="00:13:12.779" style="s2">operate within that theory of truth and pretty<br />much everyone can agree on what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.779" end="00:13:15.790" style="s2">The more well established the science, the<br />more that’s the case.</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.790" end="00:13:20.460" style="s2">Like people don’t really doubt Einstein’s<br />- people really don’t doubt quantum theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.460" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">anymore, and you guys don’t doubt it because<br />there you are using your computers and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:29.029" style="s2">wouldn’t be able to use your computers if<br />quantum theory wasn&#39;t right, so it’s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.029" end="00:13:30.029" style="s2">right enough.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.029" end="00:13:35.410" style="s2">But enough more impressively than that, whenever<br />someone’s tried to prove it wrong, in any</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.410" end="00:13:43.310" style="s2">possible way, even in its most bizarre predictions<br />over the last hundred and some years, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.310" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">passed every test with flying colors.</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:50.210" style="s2">So you know, you can make pretty damn solid<br />truth claims from within the scientific perspective,</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.210" end="00:13:54.680" style="s2">but the problem is that it’s a lot harder<br />to do that from within a moral perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.680" end="00:13:57.950" style="s2">and there&#39;s all sorts of reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.950" end="00:14:05.110" style="s2">One reason might be that there&#39;s a certain<br />amount of situational complexity related to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.110" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">every moral question that you can&#39;t reduce.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:15.380" style="s2">For example, imagine if you&#39;re a clinical<br />psychologist and you&#39;re listening to two people</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.380" end="00:14:22.209" style="s2">who know each other very well, maybe husband<br />and wife, discuss their last argument.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.209" end="00:14:26.649" style="s2">And you might say - well you might think - well<br />let&#39;s get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.649" end="00:14:29.560" style="s2">Let&#39;s find out what this argument is about.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.560" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">You might think, if you were scientifically<br />inclined, that it is in fact about something</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:40.089" style="s2">which means that if you investigated long<br />enough, you can actually figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.089" end="00:14:44.410" style="s2">facts are, but I actually don&#39;t believe that&#39;s<br />true.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.410" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2">And the reason I don’t think it’s true<br />is this.</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.240" end="00:14:50.769" style="s2">Imagine you have a - there’s this old joke<br />about these two friends.</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.769" end="00:14:55.860" style="s2">They&#39;re like 85 years old and they&#39;re sitting<br />on the park bench feeding the pigeons, and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.860" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">one friend says to the other “64,” and<br />the other guy cracks up and laughs like mad</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:02.279" style="s2">about that.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.279" end="00:15:06.170" style="s2">Then the other guy says “83,” then the<br />other guy cracks up and laughs about that,</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.170" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">and some guy’s watching them and wondering<br />what in the world is going on.</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:13.790" style="s2">So the person comes over to these old guys<br />and says what’s the scoop here?</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.790" end="00:15:17.880" style="s2">All you’re doing is sitting there saying<br />numbers to each other and then you’re laughing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.880" end="00:15:20.779" style="s2">uproariously and I just don&#39;t get it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.779" end="00:15:24.890" style="s2">And they said, well we’ve known each other<br />so long that we’ve heard each other’s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.890" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">jokes at least a hundred times and so we have<br />them completely memorized, and so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">of years ago we decided we’d just number<br />the damn things and it would take a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">time to tell then and we could laugh more<br />that way.</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:43.089" style="s2">So, it’s an interesting little joke because<br />it sheds some light on the nature of deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.089" end="00:15:49.210" style="s2">relationships, and if you have a deep relationship<br />with someone, here’s how you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.210" end="00:15:50.300" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.300" end="00:15:54.790" style="s2">Imagine you&#39;re trying to analyze an essay,<br />and I’ve actually built an essay writing</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.790" end="00:15:59.899" style="s2">module which is on my site - 230 website.</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.899" end="00:16:03.300" style="s2">I don’t remember which template it is but<br />I’ll tell you in a while.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.300" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">It’s based on this theory of meaning, roughly<br />speaking, and you should use it to write your</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:11.230" style="s2">essay because if you do, it’ll be a way<br />better essay.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.230" end="00:16:12.449" style="s2">Here’s the issue.</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.449" end="00:16:16.360" style="s2">If you&#39;re reading an essay, where is the meaning?</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.360" end="00:16:22.060" style="s2">Well, that’s a hard one because it might<br />be a hard one.</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.060" end="00:16:26.230" style="s2">So, the question might be badly formulated<br />in some sense because it might be many places.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.230" end="00:16:28.670" style="s2">But, let’s think it through logically.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.670" end="00:16:32.860" style="s2">Well you need the letters if it’s written<br />in alphabetic script.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.860" end="00:16:36.829" style="s2">So obviously some of the meaning is in the<br />letters, and then the letters are combined</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.829" end="00:16:40.600" style="s2">in certain particular ways and that gives<br />you some words, and the words are combined</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.600" end="00:16:44.220" style="s2">in some particular ways and that gives you<br />phrases, and the phrases are joined together</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.220" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">in sentences, and the sentences are strung<br />together in some reasonably coherent manner.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">So they kind of go from start to end in a<br />paragraph, and then the paragraphs are strung</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:58.310" style="s2">together in a coherent manner to make up the<br />totality of the essay.</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.310" end="00:17:02.410" style="s2">One of the things I noticed when I tried to<br />figure out how to grade essays and how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.410" end="00:17:07.939" style="s2">assess them is that you could do a good or<br />a bad job at any one of those levels.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.939" end="00:17:14.490" style="s2">Like a really bad essay is full of spelling<br />mistakes, the words are inappropriate because</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.490" end="00:17:17.939" style="s2">the person doesn&#39;t actually understand them<br />so they&#39;re awkwardly used, the phrases are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.939" end="00:17:22.459" style="s2">put together in a cliched manner, the sentence<br />structure isn&#39;t good.</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.459" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">The sentences aren&#39;t even in the right paragraphs,<br />much less organized properly.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">The paragraphs don&#39;t flow from one to another<br />in what might be called - that’s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:34.410" style="s2">where the skeleton of the story is.</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.410" end="00:17:39.000" style="s2">It’s sort of the most important level in<br />some sense, and even if that wasn&#39;t all wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.000" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">there’s actually no idea there anyways.</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:50.539" style="s2">And then you can also read essays that have<br />one or more of those flaws or some combination</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.539" end="00:17:51.539" style="s2">of all of them.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.539" end="00:17:56.210" style="s2">So very frequently, I’d read a student’s<br />essays and this often happens with smart,</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.210" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">creative students who are very badly educated,<br />and that would be probably fifty percent of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">the people in this class, I would bet.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">I say that for genuine reasons because I run<br />a fourth year seminar where I have people</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:17.220" style="s2">write extensively, so what they do is they<br />write a four page essay, and then I complain</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.220" end="00:18:21.480" style="s2">about it at all those levels of analysis,<br />and then they write the same essay again in</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.480" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2">six pages, and then I do the same thing, and<br />then I do the same thing and then they do</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.700" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">the same thing in eight pages, and half of<br />the first essays are terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:31.720" style="s2">That&#39;s partly because students do triage.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.720" end="00:18:34.340" style="s2">They think, well do I really have to work<br />in this course?</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.340" end="00:18:39.260" style="s2">I’ll try a bit and if I get slapped, I’ll<br />work a little harder, and if I don’t, I’ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.260" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">devote my time to other courses which is a<br />perfectly reasonable thing to do, but some</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.020" end="00:18:44.920" style="s2">of it is just pure inability.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.920" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">But what is really fascinating is by the end<br />of the course is that all of the students</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:53.309" style="s2">are writing well, and it’s pathetic as far<br />as I’m concerned because it meant that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.309" end="00:18:57.490" style="s2">could have been taught to write ten years<br />ago but they weren&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.490" end="00:19:02.760" style="s2">Anyways if you look at this template that<br />I laid out, then it will help you in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.760" end="00:19:11.740" style="s2">because it walks you through the process of<br />writing properly.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.740" end="00:19:14.590" style="s2">So now and then I would read an essay and<br />everything is wrong about it, but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.590" end="00:19:19.620" style="s2">a really smart about it, and knowing this<br />multilevel idea with regards to meaning, I</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.620" end="00:19:23.200" style="s2">can say, look you’re smarter than you can<br />write.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.200" end="00:19:27.140" style="s2">There&#39;s really something here, but here&#39;s<br />all the things that are wrong with it.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.140" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">Then you get a worse situation in some sense<br />where everything about the essay is good but</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:34.660" style="s2">the idea isn’t, and so the words are good,<br />the phrases.</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.660" end="00:19:38.170" style="s2">The sentences are right, and it goes together<br />but it adds up to nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.170" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">And those are hard to grade because you give<br />them a C maybe or a B, cause I’d probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">give them a B, and the person comes up and<br />says, where did I make a mistake?</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:52.270" style="s2">It’s like, well you didn&#39;t really make a<br />mistake, you just didn&#39;t do anything right,</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.270" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s a whole different problem.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:19:57.980" style="s2">So you think, that’s pretty complex with<br />regards to an essay.</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.980" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">Where’s the meaning?</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.980" end="00:20:01.650" style="s2">But that isn&#39;t where the meaning is.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.650" end="00:20:04.170" style="s2">Here, let me give you an example.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.170" end="00:20:05.530" style="s2">I was thinking of this the other day.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.530" end="00:20:09.860" style="s2">So, the ethnicity and the cultural backgrounds<br />of my students have changed quite radically</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.860" end="00:20:11.080" style="s2">over the years.</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.080" end="00:20:15.230" style="s2">When I started teaching this course for example<br />- and my personality course as well which</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.230" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">would have been thirty years ago - I can take<br />it for granted that everyone in the room would</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:22.919" style="s2">know the basic biblical stories, and they<br />would know the Judeo-Christian version of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.919" end="00:20:25.180" style="s2">them and not, say the Islamic version of them.</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.180" end="00:20:31.100" style="s2">Well that&#39;s gone, and that&#39;s really made it<br />difficult for me in some ways because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:32.100" style="s2">a bunch of things.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.100" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">There’s a bunch of collective knowledge<br />that might constitute a shared set of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.111" style="s2">assumptions that I can no longer presume and<br />it means there&#39;s all sorts of things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.111" end="00:20:48.300" style="s2">I can&#39;t talk about or if I’m going to talk<br />about, I have to step way back and start from</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.300" end="00:20:50.090" style="s2">first principles let’s say.</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.090" end="00:20:55.010" style="s2">So that’s also made me think because if<br />I - let’s say you write me an essay and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.010" end="00:20:56.990" style="s2">let’s say it’s a Psychology essay.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:00.059" style="s2">Now you&#39;re gonna presume that there&#39;s a whole<br />bunch of things I know about Psychology that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.059" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">you also know.</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">And the reason you&#39;re going to presume that<br />is because, well we come - for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">of this conversation - we come from the same<br />cultural background and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:17.539" style="s2">we share a set of assumptions, and we don&#39;t<br />have to say what those assumptions are.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.539" end="00:21:21.350" style="s2">We can assume them and then we can talk about<br />the things that we disagree about, and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.350" end="00:21:24.289" style="s2">course that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re<br />writing an essay or having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.289" end="00:21:25.289" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.289" end="00:21:29.400" style="s2">You&#39;re saying well obviously we don&#39;t have<br />to talk about what we know because we already</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.400" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">know it.</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:34.630" style="s2">We want to push that a little bit so we start<br />to talk a little bit about the things we don’t</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.630" end="00:21:40.700" style="s2">know, but no more so than we both understand.</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:44.050" style="s2">So then you think damn it, the meaning of<br />the essay isn’t in the essay at all.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.050" end="00:21:48.460" style="s2">It’s in the interaction between the shared<br />cultural assumptions between the writer and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.460" end="00:21:50.950" style="s2">the reader and the essay.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.950" end="00:21:54.630" style="s2">Well and then you think, it’s worse than<br />that even because the shared cultural assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.630" end="00:22:02.710" style="s2">are in their own sort of network, and then<br />that&#39;s nested inside a very an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.710" end="00:22:09.400" style="s2">broad biological network and it’s like actually,<br />you can continue expanding the outer reaches</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.400" end="00:22:13.630" style="s2">of the essay without limit.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.630" end="00:22:18.900" style="s2">So part of that means it’s actually impossible<br />to specify the meaning of the essay.</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.900" end="00:22:25.250" style="s2">It’s something you both work at in combination,<br />as writer and as reader, but it’s very fluid</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.250" end="00:22:26.710" style="s2">and flexible.</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.710" end="00:22:31.510" style="s2">That problem is partly why the post modernists<br />got going because they sort of noticed this.</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.510" end="00:22:37.409" style="s2">Corrupt as they are, they did notice at one<br />point that it was very very difficult to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.409" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">what any given phrase, paragraph, or essay<br />mean because it wasn&#39;t there - like it’s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:46.660" style="s2">not in the book.</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.660" end="00:22:53.500" style="s2">It’s sort of in the book, but - you know<br />this too if you listen to a piece of music.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.500" end="00:22:58.440" style="s2">So let’s say you had a favorite song when<br />you were fourteen, and when you first heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.440" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">that song, maybe you didn’t like it that<br />much, but you maybe heard it four times and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:04.010" style="s2">thought man that’s one excellent song.</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.010" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">Then at some point, you&#39;ve heard it so many<br />times that you never want to hear it again.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.340" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">That’s interesting too because it means<br />the song has transformed in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">your historical interactions with it and you<br />might say, no this song is the same.</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:22.510" style="s2">Well, it depends on what you mean by the song.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.510" end="00:23:24.510" style="s2">The notes are the same.</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.510" end="00:23:27.530" style="s2">The experience has certainly transformed.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.530" end="00:23:31.210" style="s2">So anyways, back to the couple that are sitting<br />there talking.</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.210" end="00:23:33.789" style="s2">They&#39;re having this argument and they&#39;re trying<br />to sort out what this is about.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.789" end="00:23:38.169" style="s2">Well the problem is it’s about everything<br />the argument is about plus everything that’s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.169" end="00:23:42.100" style="s2">ever happened to them in their relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.100" end="00:23:48.610" style="s2">If someone has told you the same thing fifty<br />times, it is not the same thing as the thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.610" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">they told you the first time.</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:55.310" style="s2">God only knows how many transformations it’s<br />gone through as it’s been continually repeated,</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.310" end="00:23:59.669" style="s2">and how many different arguments it’s been<br />embedded in, and how many things you’d have</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.669" end="00:24:03.029" style="s2">to know to understand the shades of intonation<br />in all of that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.029" end="00:24:10.570" style="s2">But basically each utterance a couple produces<br />is - it’s meaning is determined by the entire</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.570" end="00:24:14.140" style="s2">history of interactions that those two people<br />have had.</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.140" end="00:24:16.900" style="s2">So, how are you going to specify that?</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.900" end="00:24:19.799" style="s2">It’s very very difficult to specify it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.799" end="00:24:25.320" style="s2">Now, you really can’t, and it’s also difficult<br />to know when you’ve specified it enough.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:33.090" style="s2">You know, one of the things that is interesting<br />training as a psychoanalyst is that it started</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.090" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">to become absolutely mind boggling how much<br />archaeology you can undertake underneath a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:45.730" style="s2">single statement, especially if it’s delivered<br />with a bit of edge and some contempt.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.730" end="00:24:51.860" style="s2">It’s like there’s just levels and levels<br />and levels and levels of meaning underneath</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.860" end="00:24:55.640" style="s2">that, and you can tell that when you’re<br />engaged in an argument like that because someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.640" end="00:25:01.930" style="s2">will trigger you, let’s say, for lack of<br />a better word, and they’ll have broken a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.930" end="00:25:05.460" style="s2">rule that you have established with them and<br />you’re both in a pit.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.460" end="00:25:10.500" style="s2">The fight is about that pit, even though maybe<br />it’s about some surface thing, and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.500" end="00:25:13.780" style="s2">just running around there like rats that are<br />lit on fire and there’s nothing you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.780" end="00:25:14.850" style="s2">do about it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.850" end="00:25:20.750" style="s2">And it’s a consequence of all the issues<br />that are lurking beneath the surface of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.750" end="00:25:24.360" style="s2">speech act that seemed to be something - you<br />could capture it on a video.</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.360" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">You can say, well here’s what you said.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">There&#39;s a video tape recording of it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.820" style="s2">It’s like no, that&#39;s not what you said because<br />the videotape cannot capture the context,</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:33.820" style="s2">and it can’t.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.820" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">So you can&#39;t even get an objective record<br />of the meaning of the conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">the meaning isn’t right in the conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:43.700" style="s2">Okay so that’s one of the problems.</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.700" end="00:25:47.960" style="s2">One of the problems we’re trying to validate<br />moral claims is that you’ve got this insane</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.960" end="00:25:53.810" style="s2">contextual complexity that’s almost impossible<br />to dispose of, and so you can say - you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.810" end="00:25:59.169" style="s2">even say that if person A did action A in<br />situation A, that’d be right and then person</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.169" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">B did action A in situation A, that would<br />be wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:06.630" style="s2">It would depend on the person, and so it’s<br />very easy to slip from that into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.630" end="00:26:11.590" style="s2">moral relativism because how in the world<br />do you deal with the complexity and how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.590" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">you make a truth claim?</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">So I would really say in some sense that’s<br />the intellectual situation in modern universities.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">Now, the other thing that’s kind of interesting<br />is that this was actually discovered in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:29.470" style="s2">number of modern fields simultaneously, so<br />just as the literary theorists started to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.470" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">discover, say after World War II, that it<br />wasn’t enough to say that a book had meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:35.950" style="s2">in it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.950" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">Like there was something wrong with that,<br />and there isn&#39;t even a single meaning, there’s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:43.450" style="s2">a multiplicity of meanings and it isn&#39;t even<br />a stable multiplicity of meanings, people</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.450" end="00:26:46.700" style="s2">were finding that out in other domains as<br />well.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.700" end="00:26:53.289" style="s2">For example in artificial intelligence where<br />it became very obvious, very rapidly that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.289" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">perceiving a simple object was not simple<br />because objects aren’t simple, and the border</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:01.299" style="s2">between one object and another is in some<br />sense arbitrary.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.299" end="00:27:06.591" style="s2">I mean, when I look at each of you, I sort<br />of see you as entities, but that’s because</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.591" end="00:27:10.450" style="s2">I see you at this level of resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.450" end="00:27:13.539" style="s2">You&#39;re cellular masses at a different level<br />of resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.539" end="00:27:17.419" style="s2">You&#39;re molecular composites at a different<br />level of resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.419" end="00:27:24.510" style="s2">You’re made up of ten times as many bacteria<br />as cells at another level of resolution, so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.510" end="00:27:27.690" style="s2">really you’re more like an ocean than you<br />are like an entity.</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.690" end="00:27:31.420" style="s2">And then, well is it you or your family that’s<br />the real.</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.420" end="00:27:33.570" style="s2">Or is it you, your family, and your culture?</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.570" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">What about your species, or are you a mammal.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:45.640" style="s2">It’s like all of those things and any of<br />those things at the same time, so when I look</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.640" end="00:27:49.140" style="s2">at you, what am I supposed to see?</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.140" end="00:27:58.580" style="s2">Do I see individual with name or do I see<br />ethnicity or do I see - well you get the picture.</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.580" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">So object perception turns out to be extraordinarily<br />difficult because things aren&#39;t just simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:07.530" style="s2">objects even if they’re relatively simple.</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.530" end="00:28:11.010" style="s2">So, you throw your hands.</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.010" end="00:28:13.299" style="s2">You think how can there be any harmony.</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.299" end="00:28:15.770" style="s2">How can you draw some sort of sense from that?</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.770" end="00:28:19.500" style="s2">Okay, so that’s the argument against drawing<br />any sense out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.500" end="00:28:21.700" style="s2">But then, let’s try the other attack.</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.700" end="00:28:28.410" style="s2">Let’s see if we can make a case for there<br />being some claims of - that moral claims can</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:29.410" style="s2">be validated.</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.410" end="00:28:32.659" style="s2">Okay, so here’s a question for you.</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.659" end="00:28:36.070" style="s2">If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that didn&#39;t<br />know each other and you threw them in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.070" end="00:28:39.090" style="s2">classroom, what you would have is a war.</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.090" end="00:28:40.090" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.090" end="00:28:45.710" style="s2">Now, you&#39;re roughly in that situation, not<br />exactly because A - you’re not chimpanzees,</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.710" end="00:28:52.370" style="s2">but you know your genetic material is quite<br />reasonably related.</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.370" end="00:28:56.390" style="s2">You only split off your common ancestors seven<br />million years ago, and that seems like a long</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.390" end="00:28:59.070" style="s2">time and it is, but it’s not three hundred<br />million years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.070" end="00:29:03.299" style="s2">It’s still relatively recently from the<br />evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.299" end="00:29:06.049" style="s2">Here you all are, you don’t really know<br />each other.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.049" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">You obviously share important elements of<br />identity.</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:13.110" style="s2">So you’re all students, and you can come<br />in here and all of a sudden you all know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.110" end="00:29:15.510" style="s2">to do, and no one fights.</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.510" end="00:29:19.659" style="s2">Or if they do fight, it’s - there are very<br />constrained rules around the fighting and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.659" end="00:29:25.669" style="s2">everyone accepts them, and it seems hard to<br />say that’s not better than the alternative.</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.669" end="00:29:33.820" style="s2">So unless you wanna come in here and have<br />an absolute chaotic war.</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.820" end="00:29:38.160" style="s2">Somehow we’ve managed to figure out how<br />we can figure out how to bring relative strangers</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.160" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">together in a relatively high pressure situation<br />because we’re learning about complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:47.480" style="s2">and challenging things, and everybody gets<br />along.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.480" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">And everybody’s kind of happy about that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:54.230" style="s2">So it looks like we can figure out patterns<br />of behavior that, well, then the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.230" end="00:29:55.530" style="s2">is, are they correct?</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.530" end="00:29:57.000" style="s2">Are they morally correct?</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.000" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">Are they right, or did they work?</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2">And you might also ask yourself what’s the<br />difference between all of those claims, is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:06.600" style="s2">there similarity or difference between those<br />claims.</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.600" end="00:30:10.860" style="s2">So, and then you might ask yourself - okay<br />so here’s something else you might think</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.860" end="00:30:12.630" style="s2">about.</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.630" end="00:30:17.830" style="s2">So, let’s say you’re playing Monopoly.</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.830" end="00:30:20.120" style="s2">How many of you have played Monopoly in your<br />life?</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.120" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">Okay, is there anyone here who hasn&#39;t played<br />Monopoly?</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">Excellent.</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:27.290" style="s2">A cultural universal.</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.290" end="00:30:36.510" style="s2">So, obviously in some ways it doesn&#39;t matter<br />if you get all those little hotels right?</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.510" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">But, on the other hand if you act like it<br />doesn&#39;t matter while you&#39;re playing Monopoly,</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:45.730" style="s2">then people hit you with things and they should<br />because part of the rule is that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.730" end="00:30:49.340" style="s2">act like this matters because if you don&#39;t,<br />then it’s not any fun.</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.340" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2">So you have to act like it matters and then<br />it turns out when you start playing, it matters.</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:30:58.220" style="s2">People will actually - they’ll get angry,<br />especially if you cheat.</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.220" end="00:30:59.529" style="s2">But people will play Monopoly.</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.529" end="00:31:02.049" style="s2">They’ll act as if the endpoint matters.</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.049" end="00:31:04.909" style="s2">You might say, well what is the endpoint?</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.909" end="00:31:11.470" style="s2">And one answer is to get all the hotels and<br />all the money, so you enter the 1%, so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.470" end="00:31:15.480" style="s2">have all the wealth and no one has any, and<br />so you win and you feel happy about that,</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.480" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">even if you&#39;re a radical left winger.</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.080" end="00:31:22.029" style="s2">So that&#39;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.029" end="00:31:23.580" style="s2">Then you say, well that&#39;s not really the point.</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.580" end="00:31:29.220" style="s2">The point is to enjoy the game, and you say<br />yeah okay that’s probably the point too.</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.220" end="00:31:31.700" style="s2">And you might say, well that&#39;s not really<br />the point either.</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.700" end="00:31:35.890" style="s2">You want to hone your negotiating skills.</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.890" end="00:31:38.410" style="s2">You want to spend some time with your friends.</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.410" end="00:31:42.700" style="s2">There&#39;s lots of things going on at once, but<br />it doesn&#39;t really matter because Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.700" end="00:31:44.529" style="s2">is a game that you’ll play.</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.529" end="00:31:52.770" style="s2">Now imagine instead that Monopoly - here&#39;s<br />the new rule for Monopoly.</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.770" end="00:31:58.360" style="s2">All the people you&#39;re playing with can randomly<br />steal your hotels and houses and your money</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.360" end="00:32:02.500" style="s2">whenever they want, and you can steal it back.</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.500" end="00:32:11.640" style="s2">So then you think, well no one’s gonna play<br />that game, and then you think well why not?</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.640" end="00:32:17.750" style="s2">Well, the first surface answer is that’s<br />a stupid game, and you know that somehow.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.750" end="00:32:21.980" style="s2">You think that’s a stupid game, but then<br />you start to think about well why is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.980" end="00:32:22.980" style="s2">a stupid game?</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.980" end="00:32:27.510" style="s2">Or you might say it’s an unplayable game<br />which would be a little bit more sophisticated.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.510" end="00:32:29.320" style="s2">Why would that not work?</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.320" end="00:32:33.000" style="s2">And you might say, well what’s the point<br />in getting all the hotels if someone could</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.000" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">just take them?</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.760" end="00:32:37.340" style="s2">But you might say what’s the point in getting<br />the hotels anyway?</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.340" end="00:32:38.769" style="s2">Like who cares about the damn hotels.</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.769" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">So it’s a bit tricky.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">There’s something about the randomness of<br />what’s now allowed and the unpredictability</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:50.670" style="s2">of it and the arbitrary nature of it and its<br />lack of a relationship with your own actions</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.670" end="00:32:53.700" style="s2">that takes all the motivational impetus out<br />of the game.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.700" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">So one thing we might think about to begin<br />with, is there’s a difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:05.870" style="s2">good game and a bad game, and there&#39;s also<br />a difference between a game and no game.</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.870" end="00:33:10.860" style="s2">And we don’t know what the difference is<br />exactly, but there is a difference.</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:15.340" style="s2">We might even say not only are there good<br />games and bad games, some good games are better</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.340" end="00:33:16.659" style="s2">than other games.</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.659" end="00:33:19.860" style="s2">How many of you have played Settlers of Catan?</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.860" end="00:33:23.309" style="s2">Okay, is that better than Monopoly or worse?</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.309" end="00:33:24.649" style="s2">Student says: It’s better.</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.649" end="00:33:25.649" style="s2">better.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.649" end="00:33:27.590" style="s2">Does anyone think it’s not better?</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.590" end="00:33:30.950" style="s2">Okay, why is it better?</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.950" end="00:33:33.960" style="s2">What’s better about it?</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.960" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">It’s more complex and the part where you<br />said - I mean it’s not necessarily stealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">but there’s a piece of the game in there,<br />I think it’s like the robber or something</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">Yeah, there’s a robber.</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">Student says: And you place him on one of<br />the tiles.</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:52.919" style="s2">You can mess with people, so that’s fun.</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.919" end="00:33:54.990" style="s2">It is fun.</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.990" end="00:33:57.590" style="s2">It’s like I’m gonna get you with a robber.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.590" end="00:34:03.620" style="s2">It’s more akin to real like I think, like<br />in Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.620" end="00:34:05.510" style="s2">No, that’s reasonable.</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.510" end="00:34:07.590" style="s2">It’s also got a strategic element.</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.590" end="00:34:11.589" style="s2">How many of you play Risk?</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.589" end="00:34:17.139" style="s2">Okay, Settlers of Catan or Risk?</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.139" end="00:34:19.179" style="s2">Okay, two Risk diehards.</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.179" end="00:34:20.659" style="s2">What about the rest of you?</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.659" end="00:34:22.339" style="s2">How many are for Risk?</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.339" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">Two.</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:25.099" style="s2">How many for Settlers of Catan.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.099" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">Okay, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">Well, Settlers of Catan is a bit like Risk<br />because it has a strategic element and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:35.850" style="s2">a territorial expansion that goes along with<br />it, and there’s also trading which is one</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.850" end="00:34:38.730" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s nice about Monopoly and<br />about Risk.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.730" end="00:34:43.850" style="s2">Okay but well, you can see - you have intuitions<br />about what constitutes a better game and part</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.850" end="00:34:48.490" style="s2">of the way you develop those intuitions is<br />not exactly philosophical because I doubt</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.490" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">if you really thought through why Settlers<br />of Catan is a better game than, say, Risk</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">or Monopoly for those of that think it does,<br />but you watch your own reaction and your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:02.690" style="s2">reaction is okay well I’d rather play Settlers<br />of Catan.</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.690" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">You might ask yourself why, but you don’t<br />have to.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">You’d just rather play it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:11.470" style="s2">So then you think well what does it mean that<br />you’d rather play it?</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.470" end="00:35:14.460" style="s2">Well it’s more fun, it’s more enjoyable.</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.460" end="00:35:18.510" style="s2">If asked voluntarily, that&#39;s the one I would<br />pick, but you really don&#39;t know why, apart</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.510" end="00:35:25.970" style="s2">from those reasons but obviously those are<br />complex - that’s a complex social engagement,</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.970" end="00:35:26.970" style="s2">those games.</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.970" end="00:35:27.970" style="s2">They’re complex.</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.970" end="00:35:34.651" style="s2">In fact they’re so complex, you can have<br />preferences and not even know why, and that’s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.651" end="00:35:35.651" style="s2">interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.651" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">I think the idea that there are games, good<br />games and bad games and games and non-games,</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">is a nice way of starting to conceptualize<br />what the difference might be between moral</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.720" style="s2">systems because a game is actually a moral<br />system.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.720" end="00:35:51.150" style="s2">It has a point.</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.150" end="00:35:52.900" style="s2">It has an end.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.900" end="00:35:58.600" style="s2">You have to cooperate and compete to run through<br />the game.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.600" end="00:36:07.180" style="s2">So awhile back, a psychologist actually started<br />this and it’s reprehensible, but psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.180" end="00:36:11.130" style="s2">have done lots of reprehensible things and<br />this is one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.130" end="00:36:14.600" style="s2">This psychologist, whose name I don&#39;t remember<br />at the moment, was reviewing the literature</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.600" end="00:36:20.570" style="s2">on the difference in aggression between boys<br />and girls and men and women.</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.570" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">Boys and men are much more aggressive, depending<br />on how you define as aggressive, than girls</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:26.950" style="s2">and women.</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.950" end="00:36:31.270" style="s2">Now that tends to be mostly true with physical<br />aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.270" end="00:36:35.369" style="s2">So you might say kicking, hitting, biting,<br />punching, stealing.</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.369" end="00:36:40.330" style="s2">Two year old boys for example - two year olds,<br />the ones who do most of that are boys.</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.330" end="00:36:44.920" style="s2">Now, the two year old girls are cutting each<br />other up behind their backs but no one measures</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.920" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that.</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.680" style="s2">So you find for example, with female aggression<br />it tends to be relationship savaging, and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.680" end="00:36:52.780" style="s2">you see that in the playground.</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.780" end="00:36:53.780" style="s2">You see it in junior high.</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.780" end="00:36:55.510" style="s2">You see it in high school, and you see it<br />on the net.</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.510" end="00:36:57.380" style="s2">It’s always the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.380" end="00:37:01.780" style="s2">Whether men are more aggressive than women,<br />it depends on how you define aggression, but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.780" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">men are more physically aggressive anyways.</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">Awhile back, there was this idea that maybe<br />we could dampen down the male aggression by</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:18.660" style="s2">socializing little boys more like little girls,<br />and one of the offshoots of that was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.660" end="00:37:22.119" style="s2">we should only let children play cooperative<br />games.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.119" end="00:37:26.470" style="s2">Now, the first thing you might notice is that<br />anything you might have done as a game was</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.470" end="00:37:28.250" style="s2">not cooperative.</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.250" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">Right, like it’s not a game if it’s just<br />cooperative, but then the other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:38.670" style="s2">might notice is that the distinction between<br />a cooperative and a competitive game is far</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.670" end="00:37:42.680" style="s2">more sophisticated than people that come up<br />with those dimwitted theories of how to improve</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.680" end="00:37:44.700" style="s2">the world would ever appreciate.</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.700" end="00:37:47.050" style="s2">So here’s an example.</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.050" end="00:37:49.320" style="s2">Is hockey a game?</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.320" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:51.320" style="s2">Is it an aggressive game?</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.320" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:53.320" style="s2">Is it a competitive game?</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.320" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:55.320" style="s2">Is it a cooperative game?</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.320" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:37:57.320" style="s2">Aha.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.320" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:37:59.320" style="s2">Why is it a cooperative game?</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.320" end="00:38:01.220" style="s2">Because you have to work together.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.220" end="00:38:03.230" style="s2">Right, so there&#39;s the team right.</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.230" end="00:38:07.260" style="s2">You’re also obviously cooperating with your<br />team members, but you&#39;re also maybe trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.260" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">to be the best player, but you&#39;re also trying<br />to be the best player in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">irritate the hell out of your team players<br />right, because there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">that’s counter productive.</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:23.211" style="s2">Like, even if you&#39;re a good player and you’re<br />a prima donna and you hog the puck, say, and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.211" end="00:38:28.030" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not interested in the development<br />of your other team members, like you’re</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.030" end="00:38:30.300" style="s2">not a good player even if you are the most<br />talented.</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.300" end="00:38:32.410" style="s2">So, there’s obviously a cooperative element.</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.410" end="00:38:34.170" style="s2">Is there a cooperative element beyond that?</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.170" end="00:38:39.970" style="s2">Well yeah, you have to all agree to sort of<br />cooperate in so much as agreeing to the rules</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.970" end="00:38:42.300" style="s2">of the game and playing it.</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.300" end="00:38:43.300" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.300" end="00:38:45.620" style="s2">You don&#39;t bring a chessboard or a basketball.</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.620" end="00:38:46.620" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.620" end="00:38:51.330" style="s2">No matter if you&#39;re on different teams because<br />you&#39;re all there to play hockey.</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.330" end="00:38:55.910" style="s2">So just to play hockey is a cooperative endeavor<br />because think of all the other things you</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.910" end="00:38:58.180" style="s2">could be doing instead of playing hockey at<br />that time.</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.180" end="00:39:01.720" style="s2">You could be doing an infinite number of other<br />things so really if you look at the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.720" end="00:39:08.579" style="s2">between cooperation and competition in any<br />collaborative human affair, things are usually</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.579" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">competitive at one level, cooperative at another,<br />competitive at another, like there’s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:17.640" style="s2">continual interplay between competition and<br />cooperation and you can&#39;t disentangle them.</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.640" end="00:39:22.040" style="s2">Now one of the things that Piaget said - Piaget<br />is a, for those of you who don’t know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.040" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">you probably all do know, is perhaps the foremost<br />developmental psychologist of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:29.630" style="s2">even though he didn&#39;t think he was a psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.630" end="00:39:34.950" style="s2">Piaget actually made the claim, the radical<br />claim, that two year olds for example - this</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.950" end="00:39:38.490" style="s2">isn’t Piaget’s claim but it’s associated.</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.490" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">If you put people together, and their age<br />matched.</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:46.790" style="s2">So you got a group of nine months olds, say,<br />one year olds, two year olds, three year olds,</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.790" end="00:39:50.680" style="s2">all the way up to eighteen, and you just throw<br />them in a room, maybe with some things of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.680" end="00:39:56.790" style="s2">them to do and you count the number of violent<br />acts, which is kicking, hitting, biting, or</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.790" end="00:39:57.790" style="s2">stealing.</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.790" end="00:40:03.800" style="s2">Okay, two year olds, they’re the most violent<br />human beings and most of them aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.800" end="00:40:05.220" style="s2">violent.</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.220" end="00:40:06.670" style="s2">There&#39;s a subset of them that are violent.</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.670" end="00:40:10.600" style="s2">It’s about five to ten percent of them,<br />and almost all of them are boys, and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.600" end="00:40:16.430" style="s2">if you track those boys across time, over<br />the next two years most of them become civilized</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.430" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">and the ones that don&#39;t never become civilized.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.200" end="00:40:24.130" style="s2">So they&#39;re kind of antisocial throughout their<br />childhood, and then when testosterone kicks</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.130" end="00:40:29.579" style="s2">in at about fourteen and all the boys get<br />antisocial again, they catch up to the always</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.579" end="00:40:34.710" style="s2">antisocial boys and the normal boys taper<br />off quite dramatically at around nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.710" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">and flatten right out at about twenty seven<br />but the antisocial boys, they just keep being</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:39.840" style="s2">antisocial.</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.840" end="00:40:51.499" style="s2">So now, Piaget noted that there was a dramatic<br />transformation in behavior - individual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.499" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">- in relationship to the social world between<br />the ages of two and four.</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:01.720" style="s2">And, if you watch two year olds play together,<br />what they did fundamentally is like a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.720" end="00:41:02.790" style="s2">play.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.790" end="00:41:07.220" style="s2">So maybe, there&#39;s one two year old there and<br />another two year old there and that two year</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.220" end="00:41:11.079" style="s2">old is playing truck and this two year old<br />is playing ambulance or something or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.079" end="00:41:15.410" style="s2">playing doll, and they&#39;re sitting with each<br />other, and maybe they interact a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.410" end="00:41:18.569" style="s2">but they&#39;re not playing the same game.</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.569" end="00:41:25.430" style="s2">Okay so, what they&#39;re doing in some sense<br />is they&#39;re engaged in a goal directed activity,</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.430" end="00:41:28.450" style="s2">and it has a point.</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.450" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of integrating all their interior<br />sub personalities in a sense that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.030" style="s2">to play a single game with themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.030" end="00:41:44.231" style="s2">That&#39;s pretty complex from a cognitive perspective<br />because they&#39;re not fractionated, and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.231" end="00:41:50.550" style="s2">not being pulled out by hunger or anger or<br />sadness or fear or any of those things, and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.550" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something that&#39;s highly complex<br />cognitively and they can organize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:58.290" style="s2">well enough to do it for a substantial period<br />of time.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.290" end="00:41:59.960" style="s2">So it’s like it’s a major developmental<br />advance.</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.960" end="00:42:02.860" style="s2">But they can&#39;t do it with another person.</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.860" end="00:42:09.300" style="s2">Now one of Piaget’s hypotheses was that<br />they couldn&#39;t do it - they couldn&#39;t play the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.300" end="00:42:16.619" style="s2">same game with another person without actually<br />setting up a competitive structure so actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.619" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">competition was a prerequisite to competition.</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:25.310" style="s2">The idea was okay so, if you watch how kids<br />do this, you can get a sense of it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.310" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">I mean, on the one hand they all get together<br />and they decide how to play tag.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">Everyone knows the rules for tag, and you<br />can win at tag, but without the point - the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.210" style="s2">point in some sense is the construction of<br />a dominance hierarchy of competence.</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.210" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">Someone wins and then there are sort of the<br />people who are second best and third best,</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:45.290" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s really into doing that.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.290" end="00:42:47.653" style="s2">You all have to get together if you&#39;re kids<br />and you say well what should we do.</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.653" end="00:42:51.490" style="s2">You decide, well, we’re gonna play tag and<br />then you set up the rules because there’s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.490" end="00:42:55.210" style="s2">infinite variations of tag, and everyone goes<br />off and play.</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.210" end="00:42:59.590" style="s2">So it’s a competitive game because only<br />one person can win, or maybe one at a time</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.590" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">can win.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.820" style="s2">But once you’ve all agreed on that, then<br />you’re cooperating.</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.820" end="00:43:09.590" style="s2">So that’s quite interesting, and Piaget<br />regarded that as a necessary stage of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.590" end="00:43:12.290" style="s2">ability to act like a social creature.</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.290" end="00:43:16.579" style="s2">Here’s something that happens if you’re<br />not a very popular kid.</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.579" end="00:43:20.780" style="s2">Let’s say four kids are playing Jacks.</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.780" end="00:43:21.880" style="s2">Good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.880" end="00:43:24.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t think kids play Jacks anymore but<br />whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.150" end="00:43:28.099" style="s2">If they were playing Jacks, they’re sittings<br />there playing Jacks, and when you play Jacks,</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.099" end="00:43:32.010" style="s2">you bounce a ball and you pick up a jack,<br />and if you manage that and a ball - if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.010" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">manage that, you drop the ball and pick up<br />two jacks and drop the ball, and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.599" style="s2">going up till like eight jacks or whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.599" end="00:43:43.490" style="s2">So now another kid wants to play Jacks, and<br />we’ll say this is a relatively popular kid</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.490" end="00:43:47.560" style="s2">and so the kid sidles up to the group that’s<br />playing and sits down because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.560" end="00:43:53.050" style="s2">sitting down and then watches, and then maybe<br />watches jack-playing motions or a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.050" end="00:43:58.650" style="s2">comments about how the Jacks game is going,<br />and maybe the other kids don&#39;t have to disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.650" end="00:44:02.150" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing very much and they can<br />kind of open the circle, and let that kid</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.150" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">scoot in and he gets to, or she gets to play<br />Jacks too.</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">Whereas a kid that doesn&#39;t - and that often<br />doesn&#39;t happen, even if it’s a popular kid.</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:12.550" style="s2">Sometimes the little group that&#39;s already<br />formed won’t open and let them in.</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.550" end="00:44:14.320" style="s2">You&#39;ve been to cocktail parties.</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.320" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:17.300" style="s2">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.300" end="00:44:21.109" style="s2">So you’re supposed to hang around the edge<br />of the conversation and maybe if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.109" end="00:44:26.230" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t too stupid to say, you<br />can offer it and maybe they’d let you in.</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.230" end="00:44:31.390" style="s2">Okay, now if you&#39;re maybe not very social,<br />what you do is stand out there and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.390" end="00:44:35.800" style="s2">notice what the hell is going on and you don&#39;t<br />start to match your body to what’s happening,</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.800" end="00:44:39.430" style="s2">and maybe you say, I don&#39;t want to play Jacks,<br />that&#39;s a stupid game.</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.430" end="00:44:43.351" style="s2">Let&#39;s go do something else, in which case<br />the kids are not happy with you, and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.351" end="00:44:44.630" style="s2">unpopular.</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.630" end="00:44:45.630" style="s2">And that’s that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.630" end="00:44:49.780" style="s2">You&#39;re stuck with it because if you&#39;ve got<br />that by the time you’re four, the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.780" end="00:44:53.240" style="s2">kids are gonna leave you so far in the dust<br />you’re never going to catch up.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.240" end="00:44:56.329" style="s2">Okay, so what have we concluded from that?</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.329" end="00:45:00.260" style="s2">We might conclude that people play games.</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.260" end="00:45:01.810" style="s2">There&#39;s lots of different games.</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.810" end="00:45:04.380" style="s2">There’s lots of different playable games.</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.380" end="00:45:07.810" style="s2">There might even be an infinite number of<br />playable games.</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.810" end="00:45:11.400" style="s2">There&#39;s a lot of non playable games, those<br />are the ones that aren’t any fun, and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.400" end="00:45:13.780" style="s2">a lot of interactions that aren’t games.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.780" end="00:45:19.339" style="s2">Okay so we can all accept that, and then we’ve<br />added to that the observation, or the presupposition,</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.339" end="00:45:26.599" style="s2">the ability to play games is a prerequisite<br />for being socialized, so being able to operate</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.599" end="00:45:30.790" style="s2">together with people and that that operation<br />has elements of competition and elements of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.790" end="00:45:32.290" style="s2">cooperation.</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.290" end="00:45:33.800" style="s2">Reasonable?</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.800" end="00:45:39.320" style="s2">And then you might say, well everything people<br />do communally has a game like aspect, and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.320" end="00:45:43.530" style="s2">you might say well that&#39;s actually why kids<br />like to play games because kids play games</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.530" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">because games are a simplified analog of life,<br />and if you get good at playing games - well</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:53.250" style="s2">what happens is that the games you play are<br />increasingly complex and more and more real</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.250" end="00:45:57.710" style="s2">world like until they&#39;re actually indistinguishable<br />from acting in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.710" end="00:46:05.920" style="s2">But they&#39;re even then they&#39;re still games<br />in a sense because they could - the rules</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:06.920" style="s2">could be different.</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.920" end="00:46:09.590" style="s2">But then, you might think well are there things<br />that couldn’t be different?</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.590" end="00:46:10.890" style="s2">Well, yeah there are some things.</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.890" end="00:46:12.170" style="s2">It’s gonna be cooperative.</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:13.579" style="s2">It’s gonna be competitive.</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.579" end="00:46:15.540" style="s2">There&#39;s gonna be rules.</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.540" end="00:46:17.540" style="s2">Everybody needs to agree on the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.540" end="00:46:18.730" style="s2">People have to want to play.</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.730" end="00:46:20.520" style="s2">This is something else Piaget observed.</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.520" end="00:46:21.970" style="s2">It’s bloody brilliant.</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.970" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">He thought well, how can you decide if one<br />game is better than another.</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.750" end="00:46:33.640" style="s2">Let’s say that&#39;s a moral claim in a sense,<br />but he wanted to narrow it down so that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.640" end="00:46:35.800" style="s2">was possible it could be answered.</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.800" end="00:46:40.950" style="s2">What he said was imagine you have group A<br />that was attempting to obtain a goal, and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.950" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">group B that are attempting to attain a goal.</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:47.650" style="s2">Both groups have agreed that attaining the<br />goal is valuable.</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.650" end="00:46:50.089" style="s2">We don’t have to argue about the value of<br />the goal.</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.089" end="00:46:51.390" style="s2">We’ve settled that.</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.390" end="00:46:55.960" style="s2">Okay now, we’re going to make a further<br />assumption which is all things considered,</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.960" end="00:46:59.970" style="s2">getting towards the goal with less effort,<br />more enjoyment, and less trouble would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.970" end="00:47:00.970" style="s2">better.</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:04.220" style="s2">Okay, you have to take that as a given because<br />it might not be.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.220" end="00:47:06.349" style="s2">Sometimes something difficult is better.</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.349" end="00:47:13.630" style="s2">Well then you might say okay, would people<br />working voluntarily or involuntarily be more</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.630" end="00:47:19.230" style="s2">likely be able to reach that goal with less<br />misery faster and more effectively.</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.230" end="00:47:23.930" style="s2">Piaget’s answer was if you could get people<br />to play the game voluntarily, you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.930" end="00:47:29.829" style="s2">to waste effort on enforcement, no one kicks<br />back so the system is going to be more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.829" end="00:47:31.050" style="s2">across time.</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.050" end="00:47:38.609" style="s2">Now that’s smart because he’s got a way<br />of conceptualizing what might constitute a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.609" end="00:47:40.130" style="s2">better system.</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.130" end="00:47:43.640" style="s2">Now it’s grounded in subjective experience<br />in some degree.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.640" end="00:47:48.820" style="s2">Less misery, more enjoyment, but there&#39;s also<br />a way of measuring it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.820" end="00:47:54.810" style="s2">It’s also more efficient, or it does what<br />it’s supposed to do with less noise and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.810" end="00:47:55.810" style="s2">grief.</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.810" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">Less cost, let’s say.</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">So that’s pretty smart.</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:07.540" style="s2">Okay, so then let’s make another - well<br />how old do you think kids games are?</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.540" end="00:48:12.110" style="s2">And I don’t know what’s happened to kids<br />in recent years because their culture has</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.110" end="00:48:17.980" style="s2">somewhat been seriously disrupted by television<br />and computer, but you guys are a lot younger</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.980" end="00:48:18.980" style="s2">than me.</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.980" end="00:48:21.020" style="s2">Did you play hide and go seek?</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.020" end="00:48:23.170" style="s2">You know ring around the rosie?</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.170" end="00:48:24.170" style="s2">You know that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.170" end="00:48:25.170" style="s2">Do you know what that is?</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.170" end="00:48:26.170" style="s2">You don’t know Ring Around the Rosie.</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.170" end="00:48:27.829" style="s2">How many people don’t know that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.829" end="00:48:31.560" style="s2">Ring around the rosie, pockets full of posies,<br />hush ah hush ah, we all fall down?</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.560" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">Okay, how many know that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:35.050" style="s2">It’s an English nursery rhyme.</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.050" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">It’s about the plague.</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:39.250" style="s2">It’s about the black plague by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.250" end="00:48:44.200" style="s2">And so, that piece of doggerel, that piece<br />of rhyme has been around, transmitted by the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.200" end="00:48:47.190" style="s2">oral culture of children since the time of<br />the black plague.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.190" end="00:48:52.700" style="s2">And so a lot of children’s tradition is<br />in the oral tradition, and a lot of the games</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.700" end="00:48:56.339" style="s2">children play are passed along by children.</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.339" end="00:48:58.460" style="s2">Kids learn how to play hide and go seek.</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.460" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">And how many of you played tag?</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:03.880" style="s2">Anyone never play tag?</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.880" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">Right, so everyone plays tag.</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:10.050" style="s2">How would you conceptualize tag if you were<br />a biologist?</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.050" end="00:49:13.460" style="s2">What do you think children are doing?</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.460" end="00:49:16.090" style="s2">They’re hunting.</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.090" end="00:49:18.020" style="s2">They&#39;re chasing things down, obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.020" end="00:49:19.390" style="s2">They&#39;re chasing things down.</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.390" end="00:49:23.160" style="s2">Now hide and go seek, that’s a tougher one,<br />but it’s certainly exploration.</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.160" end="00:49:27.530" style="s2">They’re exploring the landscape, and they&#39;re<br />matching wits with one another, but - and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.530" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">they&#39;re also trying to see if - you know,<br />do people like you enough to actually find</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">you, which is a helpful thing to know if you&#39;re<br />four years old.</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:41.940" style="s2">So anyways, children pass these games down<br />across the centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.940" end="00:49:45.310" style="s2">Maybe tag is one of those games you don&#39;t<br />even have to pass down.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.310" end="00:49:49.540" style="s2">Children might just invent it spontaneously<br />with every generation because you can more</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.540" end="00:49:52.130" style="s2">or less play tag with a dog.</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.130" end="00:49:58.030" style="s2">I mean, the dog doesn&#39;t quite get it, but<br />it’s close.</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.030" end="00:50:04.819" style="s2">Okay, so there are some games that are enjoyable<br />enough that they&#39;re either transmitted and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.819" end="00:50:09.980" style="s2">everyone knows them very rapidly, or they&#39;re<br />so close to our nature we can just reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.980" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">them and I think tag is the classic example<br />of that.</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">So that’s interesting too because what it<br />means is that there’s certain types of competitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:20.030" style="s2">and cooperative behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.030" end="00:50:25.820" style="s2">Those are elementary moral systems that are<br />- they look like they&#39;re integral to our nature.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.820" end="00:50:30.319" style="s2">You can even say they&#39;re built right in, or<br />you might say they&#39;re so close to built in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.319" end="00:50:35.510" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t take much of an introduction<br />for the roles of the game before everybody’s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.510" end="00:50:36.780" style="s2">pretty happy with it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.780" end="00:50:38.710" style="s2">You see this with a lot of things.</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.710" end="00:50:41.220" style="s2">You play peek-a-boo with a baby.</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.220" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">Okay so what are the rules?</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:44.180" style="s2">What are the rules of peek-a-boo.</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.180" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">You cover your eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:50.460" style="s2">You cover your eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.460" end="00:50:51.559" style="s2">Okay so that’s right.</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.559" end="00:50:53.290" style="s2">You go like this.</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.290" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">Okay then what’s the next rule?</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:57.470" style="s2">That’s right.</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.470" end="00:50:58.470" style="s2">You reveal your eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.470" end="00:51:00.290" style="s2">You don&#39;t just sit there like this.</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.290" end="00:51:05.470" style="s2">Now you can play a trick on a baby if you<br />want, and babies will laugh about this sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.470" end="00:51:07.820" style="s2">of thing which is really, I think, quite amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.820" end="00:51:10.700" style="s2">A baby’s laugh is something remarkable to<br />me.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.700" end="00:51:15.580" style="s2">So you can go like this, and then like this<br />and then like this and then like this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.580" end="00:51:20.710" style="s2">then you can do this, and the baby will laugh<br />because that&#39;s a little variation eh.</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.710" end="00:51:24.140" style="s2">Or you can go like this.</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.140" end="00:51:25.869" style="s2">Right.</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.869" end="00:51:28.570" style="s2">And then the baby - well that’ll even make<br />you guys laugh.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.570" end="00:51:32.200" style="s2">That’s good, you can see how deeply rooted<br />this is.</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.200" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">So you know but, eventually what’ll the<br />baby do?</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:38.510" style="s2">It’ll grab your hands, pull them down because<br />you&#39;re breaking the damn rules.</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.510" end="00:51:43.130" style="s2">And the baby knows the rules even though you’ve<br />never established any rules, and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.130" end="00:51:45.099" style="s2">the rules going with about five reps.</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.099" end="00:51:46.369" style="s2">You say okay, this.</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.369" end="00:51:49.369" style="s2">Maybe no one’s ever played peek-a-boo with<br />a baby.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.369" end="00:51:50.809" style="s2">The baby figures it out right away.</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.809" end="00:51:53.670" style="s2">This, this, and then you vary that.</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.670" end="00:51:54.670" style="s2">Maybe do that.</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.670" end="00:51:58.580" style="s2">That baby thinks that’s a hell of a good<br />joke, you know, cause you went up instead</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.580" end="00:52:02.210" style="s2">of down, and so it’s variations within this<br />rule bound theme.</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.210" end="00:52:05.900" style="s2">It’s kind of musical in a sense, there’s<br />variations in the theme.</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.900" end="00:52:07.740" style="s2">Now what you don’t do is go.</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.740" end="00:52:08.740" style="s2">Waahh!</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.740" end="00:52:13.140" style="s2">Cause that’ll just short it right out.</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.140" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">So you don&#39;t do that unless you’re, you<br />know, unless you have an evil streak in you.</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:24.450" style="s2">So there&#39;s certainly ways of violating the<br />baby’s expectations and what the baby will</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.450" end="00:52:28.619" style="s2">do if you do that is startle and they startle<br />with their whole bodies, and then look at</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.619" end="00:52:31.859" style="s2">you and probably they’ll burst into tears.</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.859" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">But some babies will just laugh like mad if<br />something like that happens, and you can find</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:40.421" style="s2">those babies all over YouTube, right, because<br />you get the baby that the mother sneezes and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.421" end="00:52:43.310" style="s2">the baby has a fit laughing for like ten minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.310" end="00:52:45.510" style="s2">But it’s quite interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.510" end="00:52:48.540" style="s2">One of the things about babies that I’ve<br />never been able to understand is the staggering</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.540" end="00:52:51.820" style="s2">sophistication of their senses of humor.</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.820" end="00:52:53.170" style="s2">Like it’s deep eh?</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.170" end="00:52:55.751" style="s2">Cause even a nine month old baby can play<br />tricks on you.</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.751" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">So, you know they&#39;re baby tricks, but still,<br />they’re tricks and they laugh and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:02.980" style="s2">quite comical and they like variation.</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.980" end="00:53:09.120" style="s2">Anyways, the point is - one of the points<br />of all this is this understanding of game</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.120" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">like structure is really really really really<br />really really deep inside of us, and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:17.809" style="s2">way before articulation.</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.809" end="00:53:21.579" style="s2">It’s way before we can say the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.579" end="00:53:26.839" style="s2">Babies can pick up the damn rules right away<br />and it’s kind of a dance in some sense,</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.839" end="00:53:29.730" style="s2">and a dance is also a rule bound structure.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.730" end="00:53:34.201" style="s2">If you’re dancing with someone well, there’s<br />rules, but don&#39;t step on their feet but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.201" end="00:53:39.320" style="s2">also set up a set of expectations in the dance<br />and you violate them in tandem.</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.320" end="00:53:42.140" style="s2">And if you can do it gracefully, it’s fun.</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.140" end="00:53:46.820" style="s2">Maybe the person you’re dancing with is<br />an absolute klutz and so autistic you can’t</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.820" end="00:53:51.089" style="s2">even get outside of yourself, and might make<br />a half reasonable partner or if it’s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.089" end="00:53:52.770" style="s2">hopeless.</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.770" end="00:53:54.150" style="s2">But the dance is the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.150" end="00:53:55.910" style="s2">It’s not negotiated verbally.</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.910" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">It’s negotiated bodily, and unless we’re<br />able to imitate, and imitate insanely well</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.970" style="s2">because human beings can imitate like mad,<br />because we won’t be able to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.970" end="00:54:07.550" style="s2">So babies are the same way.</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.550" end="00:54:10.430" style="s2">You basically start - you don’t actually.</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.430" end="00:54:17.070" style="s2">Peek-a-boo doesn’t have rules because a<br />rule is a stated description of a set of expectations.</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.070" end="00:54:23.819" style="s2">What peek-a-boo has is expectations and repetition,<br />and you can violate the expectation but that</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.819" end="00:54:29.400" style="s2">doesn’t mean you’re violating a rule because<br />an expectation is not a rule until you observe</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.400" end="00:54:34.490" style="s2">the expectation, you describe what it is and<br />maybe even write it down.</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.490" end="00:54:40.410" style="s2">You can play games long before you can follow<br />rules, and one of the things Piaget observed</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:46.350" style="s2">is if you watched kids play a complicated<br />game like marbles and they&#39;re like six, and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.350" end="00:54:49.730" style="s2">you take them out of the game and ask them<br />what the rules are, they can&#39;t tell you or</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.730" end="00:54:52.680" style="s2">they might get some of them right and a bunch<br />of them wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.680" end="00:54:57.030" style="s2">Maybe if you interviewed every child that<br />was playing, and you looked at the commonality</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.030" end="00:55:01.319" style="s2">of the descriptions, you could extract out<br />the underlying rule structure of the game.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.319" end="00:55:03.160" style="s2">But the kids don&#39;t know the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.160" end="00:55:08.420" style="s2">What they know is how to play with other kids<br />when they&#39;re playing marbles, and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.420" end="00:55:13.569" style="s2">that’s nonverbal hints and eyebrow raises<br />and no you can’t do that and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.569" end="00:55:16.819" style="s2">It isn&#39;t much later until they can tell you<br />the rules, if ever.</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.819" end="00:55:22.780" style="s2">So like, you know, you guys can&#39;t tell me<br />the rules for dancing successfully with someone.</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.780" end="00:55:27.569" style="s2">You can tell me some stupid things you shouldn’t<br />do, but imagine how complex it is.</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.569" end="00:55:31.650" style="s2">It’s very difficult to articulate out the<br />whole structure, but you can sure tell when</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.650" end="00:55:36.040" style="s2">it’s happening, and you can sure tell when<br />you’re not doing it or when your partner</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.040" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">isn’t.</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:41.540" style="s2">So partly what that also means is you know<br />how to do things you don&#39;t know how to do,</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.540" end="00:55:45.900" style="s2">and you know how to all sorts of things you<br />don&#39;t know how you know how to do.</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.900" end="00:55:48.619" style="s2">In fact, most of what you know is like that.</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.619" end="00:55:55.910" style="s2">That also means we can be playing games that<br />are extraordinarily sophisticated that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.910" end="00:55:59.960" style="s2">don’t understand, but that doesn&#39;t mean<br />- well we can&#39;t describe at least.</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.960" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">We don&#39;t have an articulated knowledge of<br />the structure, but we can still play them.</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:07.910" style="s2">Now, I don&#39;t know if you know this or not.</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.910" end="00:56:11.690" style="s2">You might know it.</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.690" end="00:56:16.290" style="s2">A while back, twenty years ago - about that.</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.290" end="00:56:23.859" style="s2">Those massive online multiplayer games started<br />to become popular, and some of them - I think,</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.859" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">although I don&#39;t know this for sure - some<br />of them lasted a long time, and maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:29.560" style="s2">of them still being played, like the early<br />ones.</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.560" end="00:56:35.780" style="s2">So they developed entire worlds in there and<br />you know, there was an economist who became</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.780" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">quite famous because of those games.</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:40.410" style="s2">Castronova, I think his name was.</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.410" end="00:56:41.590" style="s2">Edward Castronova.</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.590" end="00:56:45.630" style="s2">I think that’s right, but it’s close.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.630" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">Anyways, he thought hey look man those aren’t<br />games, those are countries.</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:56.299" style="s2">So one of the things he tried to do was calculate<br />their gross national product, and you know,</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.299" end="00:57:00.740" style="s2">you can trade items in those little worlds<br />and you could sell them on eBay.</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.740" end="00:57:05.569" style="s2">For awhile in this one game, and maybe this<br />still happens, there were young people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.569" end="00:57:09.720" style="s2">the Philippines who were working inside these<br />games making artifacts that they were selling</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.720" end="00:57:14.670" style="s2">on eBay to other game players because they<br />could make more money doing that than actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.670" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">working in the actual world.</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:22.340" style="s2">So Castronova - I think was his name - said<br />well you don&#39;t get it.</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.340" end="00:57:23.660" style="s2">That is the real world.</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.660" end="00:57:28.210" style="s2">It’s not a game, or if it’s a game it’s<br />so much like the world that it’s part of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.210" end="00:57:29.210" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.210" end="00:57:32.980" style="s2">So he calculated the gross national product<br />of some of these massive games, and they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.980" end="00:57:35.809" style="s2">like the 30th richest country in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.809" end="00:57:37.940" style="s2">It was insane.</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.940" end="00:57:43.720" style="s2">So that’s interesting because that also<br />shows you that the line between a game and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.720" end="00:57:46.140" style="s2">reality is not clear.</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.140" end="00:57:48.650" style="s2">Here’s another example of that.</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.650" end="00:57:51.849" style="s2">Something worth thinking about.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.849" end="00:57:57.171" style="s2">Some of you have no doubt played very complex<br />multiplayer online games, and I suppose those</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.171" end="00:58:00.890" style="s2">are often adventure games or quest games and<br />you have to communicate with other people</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.890" end="00:58:06.170" style="s2">and you have to solve problems and maybe you<br />have to defend yourselves, like you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.170" end="00:58:08.170" style="s2">an exploratory party in a new world.</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.170" end="00:58:09.170" style="s2">Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.170" end="00:58:14.839" style="s2">So it’s pretty sophisticated, and okay some<br />of you have worked at McDonald’s or another</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.839" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">fast food restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">How many of you have worked at a restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:20.630" style="s2">How many at a fast food restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.630" end="00:58:26.809" style="s2">Would you say that an online game is more<br />like the world, or less like the world than</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.809" end="00:58:29.160" style="s2">your job at a fast food restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.160" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">More.</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:31.990" style="s2">It’s more.</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.990" end="00:58:33.869" style="s2">Anybody disagree?</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.869" end="00:58:36.900" style="s2">Okay, why is it more like the real world?</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.900" end="00:58:41.110" style="s2">Because you’re doing more complex stuff.</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.110" end="00:58:42.510" style="s2">What are you doing?</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.510" end="00:58:43.510" style="s2">You’re exploring.</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.510" end="00:58:44.510" style="s2">You’re thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.510" end="00:58:49.120" style="s2">You’re getting out of situations because<br />new ones are always coming up and you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.120" end="00:58:50.869" style="s2">with them and you’re learning.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.869" end="00:58:55.830" style="s2">Fast food is like you&#39;re doing - Right, you’re<br />a real cog in a fast food machine.</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.830" end="00:58:57.720" style="s2">Yeah, but it’s in the real world.</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.720" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">Is it a game?</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:01.319" style="s2">You’re more like a machine in the fast food<br />part.</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.319" end="00:59:09.740" style="s2">So does that mean McDonald’s is less real<br />than a multiplayer online game?</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.740" end="00:59:13.930" style="s2">Well it’s a tough one, eh, because when<br />you’re trying to think about what real means,</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.930" end="00:59:16.780" style="s2">is you might think maybe I phrased that wrongly.</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.780" end="00:59:23.589" style="s2">Maybe I could say is McDonald’s a worse<br />model of the real world than a multiplayer</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.589" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">online game?</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:29.140" style="s2">And it’s hard because it’s hard to say<br />McDonald’s isn’t part of the real world</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.140" end="00:59:31.859" style="s2">so a priori, the claim is kind of absurd.</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.859" end="00:59:34.869" style="s2">It’s like well, you’re in a building.</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.869" end="00:59:35.930" style="s2">People actually come there.</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.930" end="00:59:37.049" style="s2">They give you money.</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.049" end="00:59:38.460" style="s2">It’s real.</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.460" end="00:59:43.790" style="s2">But then, well you think about these complex<br />games and you’re practicing an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.790" end="00:59:48.040" style="s2">sophisticated form of social and intellectual<br />behavior and we actually don’t know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.040" end="00:59:49.070" style="s2">that does to people.</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.070" end="00:59:51.980" style="s2">Maybe it makes them extraordinarily sophisticated<br />and social.</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.980" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">I do think it helps with introverts quite<br />a lot because it’s harder for introverts</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:00.849" style="s2">to become extremely socially fluid because<br />people wear them out.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.849" end="01:00:05.940" style="s2">A lot of introverts do a lot of heavy duty<br />socializing on the net, and in my experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.940" end="01:00:13.500" style="s2">it’s been, all things considered, probably<br />a plus rather than a minus.</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.500" end="01:00:19.710" style="s2">With regards to your use of computational<br />devices, one of the things I used to see my</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.710" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">kids doing is they would sit together in a<br />group.</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:27.580" style="s2">They were teenagers, and there’d be a bunch<br />of friends that weren&#39;t there and while they</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.580" end="01:00:30.650" style="s2">were interacting with all their friends who<br />were there, they were also interacting with</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.650" end="01:00:32.109" style="s2">all their friends who weren’t there.</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.109" end="01:00:35.300" style="s2">Is that a common thing for teenagers to do?</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.300" end="01:00:37.750" style="s2">You’re texting your friends and so forth.</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.750" end="01:00:40.250" style="s2">Is that reasonably standard behavior?</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.250" end="01:00:42.260" style="s2">How many of you have done that?</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.260" end="01:00:44.770" style="s2">Okay how many of you have done that regularly?</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.770" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">Okay, how many of you haven’t done that?</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.369" style="s2">Okay, so most people have done it but not<br />everyone.</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.369" end="01:00:55.560" style="s2">For those of you have done it, is that more<br />advanced or less advanced social behavior?</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.560" end="01:00:56.650" style="s2">More.</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.650" end="01:00:57.680" style="s2">Okay you think more.</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.680" end="01:00:58.680" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.680" end="01:01:01.690" style="s2">Cause you’re keeping your friends in the<br />room while they’re not there.</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.690" end="01:01:04.270" style="s2">So it’s like they have a conceptual idea<br />of what you’re doing and it’s like - they</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.270" end="01:01:15.980" style="s2">understand where the group dynamics are moving<br />towards without them actually having be there.</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.980" end="01:01:22.530" style="s2">Okay, do you think that you paid a price for<br />it in the decrease of the interactions you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.530" end="01:01:25.119" style="s2">were having with the people that were actually<br />there?</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.119" end="01:01:26.119" style="s2">Not really.Yes.</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.119" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">You think so.</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:30.820" style="s2">Okay, how many people think they do pay a<br />price for it?</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.820" end="01:01:33.420" style="s2">How many people think they didn’t?</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.420" end="01:01:39.010" style="s2">Okay, so - well let’s start with you guys<br />then.</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.010" end="01:01:40.980" style="s2">Why did you think you didn&#39;t pay a price for<br />it?</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.980" end="01:01:41.980" style="s2">Well because I feel like it really doesn&#39;t<br />take that much time to just text and go back</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.980" end="01:01:42.980" style="s2">to talk to your friends.</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.980" end="01:01:43.980" style="s2">Okay.</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.980" end="01:01:47.730" style="s2">Well I think that you can pay a price, but<br />if you’re doing it correctly and you’re</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.730" end="01:01:59.390" style="s2">monitoring the conversation you&#39;re taking<br />a part of, you can see when it would be appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.390" end="01:02:08.069" style="s2">to text someone else which probably means<br />you&#39;re paying more attention to the people</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.069" end="01:02:11.799" style="s2">you&#39;re talking with because you&#39;re also texting.</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.799" end="01:02:18.200" style="s2">Okay so you’re kind of taking a multitasking<br />rationale for it in some sense, although assuming</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.200" end="01:02:20.619" style="s2">you have to also heighten your attention to<br />manage that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.619" end="01:02:24.240" style="s2">There’s people who didn&#39;t think - that you<br />did pay a price for it.</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.240" end="01:02:25.520" style="s2">Who thought that?</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:26.930" style="s2">Okay, what sort of price?</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.930" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">I think that especially when you&#39;re texting<br />people, there&#39;s so much complexity that gets</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:36.580" style="s2">lost in translation, like you don&#39;t really<br />convey your feelings, like there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.580" end="01:02:38.310" style="s2">more to use than language.</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.310" end="01:02:39.800" style="s2">Okay then they certainly lose something.</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.800" end="01:02:47.049" style="s2">What about you, while you&#39;re interacting with<br />your actual present friends?</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.049" end="01:03:02.890" style="s2">I would say you have to commit some certain<br />amount of effort to writing a text, you ignore</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.890" end="01:03:03.990" style="s2">aspects of - for example, they’re asking<br />about something and then you go and text the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.990" end="01:03:07.270" style="s2">person and you come back and miss some part<br />of the conversation.</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.270" end="01:03:08.270" style="s2">Yeah, so it’s like kind of -<br />Yeah so it’s kind of like start, stop, start,</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.270" end="01:03:09.270" style="s2">stop.</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.270" end="01:03:10.270" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you can one hundred percent<br />commit yourself to -</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.270" end="01:03:11.370" style="s2">Well one of the things you suggested was that<br />some of that can be mitigated by doing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.370" end="01:03:17.940" style="s2">properly, which implies there&#39;s an emergent<br />norm for doing this sort of thing and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.940" end="01:03:22.740" style="s2">if you&#39;re good at complying with the norm,<br />then you’re not irritating people and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.740" end="01:03:24.210" style="s2">you can handle both things at once.</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.210" end="01:03:25.210" style="s2">Something like that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.210" end="01:03:30.470" style="s2">But if it’s properly to the people who are<br />there, is it proper for the friend who is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.470" end="01:03:32.090" style="s2">waiting for you to answer?</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.090" end="01:03:36.270" style="s2">Well I guess one answer to that is that’s<br />up to them to determine, like if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.270" end="01:03:39.190" style="s2">want to be part of it, they can do something<br />else.</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.190" end="01:03:42.890" style="s2">The reason I’m saying that specifically<br />is that you can imagine that’s how the norm</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.890" end="01:03:43.890" style="s2">develops.</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.890" end="01:03:50.170" style="s2">It’s like obviously if a successful norm<br />is going to develop that allows text conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.170" end="01:03:56.289" style="s2">and real world conversation to occur at the<br />same time, everybody has to want it to happen.</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.289" end="01:04:01.330" style="s2">That means if you can’t do it in the manner<br />that everyone wants, it’s going to die out.</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.330" end="01:04:09.369" style="s2">Now see, that&#39;s another example of how you<br />can see how moral structures - I think - might</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.369" end="01:04:13.560" style="s2">evolve, is the right way of thinking about<br />it because I think moral structures evolve.</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.560" end="01:04:17.240" style="s2">And I think they’re just as real as anything<br />else that evolves.</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.240" end="01:04:20.690" style="s2">Now, evolved things can be staggeringly complex.</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.690" end="01:04:25.349" style="s2">Just think about how many lifeforms there<br />are, and how many niches there are for their</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.349" end="01:04:30.220" style="s2">lifeforms and so you have in some sense an<br />infinite variety, but it’s not infinite,</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.220" end="01:04:32.289" style="s2">and it follows patterns.</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.289" end="01:04:36.500" style="s2">Not just any old thing can be alive, and not<br />just any old thing can be social.</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.500" end="01:04:42.630" style="s2">Here’s an example, and I found this out<br />awhile back.</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.630" end="01:04:48.920" style="s2">I did a lot of neurobiological research.</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.920" end="01:04:55.030" style="s2">Some of it hands on, a lot of it conceptual<br />especially in the early days of my graduate</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.030" end="01:04:56.030" style="s2">work.</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.030" end="01:04:58.990" style="s2">I got really interested in the function of<br />serotonin.</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.990" end="01:05:03.510" style="s2">You all know, undoubtedly, that one of the<br />things antidepressants do is decrease the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.510" end="01:05:06.951" style="s2">rate at which serotonin is pulled back up<br />into the neurons that deliver it and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.951" end="01:05:09.790" style="s2">seems to help stabilize people’s negative<br />emotions.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.790" end="01:05:14.420" style="s2">Makes them less volatile, less anxious, less<br />likely to withdraw, and so - or you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.420" end="01:05:17.010" style="s2">say it makes them more confident.</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.010" end="01:05:24.109" style="s2">Now we also know if you say we look at a chimp<br />hierarchy, you take bottom chimp and you give</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.109" end="01:05:28.320" style="s2">him anti-depressants, he looks a lot more<br />like top chimp.</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.320" end="01:05:32.160" style="s2">So, because the bottom chimp world is a very<br />dangerous place.</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.160" end="01:05:33.160" style="s2">It’s very uncertain.</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.160" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t have a place to sleep.</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t have high quality mates.</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:38.070" style="s2">He doesn&#39;t have good things to eat.</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.070" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">He’s stressed man, it’s bad down there.</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:44.200" style="s2">So maybe that&#39;s part of the reason his nervous<br />system is tuned so that he’s more anxious</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.200" end="01:05:47.980" style="s2">and upset by everything because everything<br />is more dangerous.</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.980" end="01:05:49.710" style="s2">Part of that’s modulated by serotonin.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.710" end="01:05:51.980" style="s2">Okay, so here’s a rough rule.</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.980" end="01:05:59.430" style="s2">If there’s a hierarchy in an animal kingdom,<br />as you move up the hierarchy, your serotonin</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.430" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">levels increase and as you move down the hierarchy,<br />your serotonin levels decrease and that’s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:08.339" style="s2">somewhat independent of your absolute wealth.</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.339" end="01:06:09.380" style="s2">So here’s a famous experiment.</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.380" end="01:06:13.589" style="s2">It’s called the White Hall experiment and<br />it was done on English bureaucrats, and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.589" end="01:06:17.040" style="s2">thing that’s so cool about the White Hall<br />experiments is they were done fifty years</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.040" end="01:06:18.040" style="s2">apart.</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.040" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">So what they showed basically was - imagine<br />you take an English bureaucracy and you stratify</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:24.770" style="s2">it by position.</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.770" end="01:06:29.310" style="s2">Englishmen are hierarchical, and so you stratify<br />it by position.</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.310" end="01:06:35.110" style="s2">You have the top people and the bottom people<br />and what you find is the bottom people die</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.110" end="01:06:37.440" style="s2">faster and more often.</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.440" end="01:06:41.400" style="s2">You might say if you&#39;re not that healthy,<br />you end up at the bottom.</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.400" end="01:06:46.490" style="s2">Fair enough, but there seems to be an effect<br />above the effect of just general health.</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.490" end="01:06:49.520" style="s2">It’s worse to be at the bottom than at the<br />top.</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:55.890" style="s2">Okay, that was true 70 years ago, and another<br />study was done 50 years after that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.890" end="01:07:01.480" style="s2">Now the thing that’s so cool is by that<br />time, from a material perspective, the people</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.480" end="01:07:06.980" style="s2">at the bottom of the modern hierarchy were<br />at least as wealthy as the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.980" end="01:07:16.230" style="s2">like two thirds of the way up 50 years before<br />because everybody had running water, everyone</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.230" end="01:07:18.660" style="s2">had enough heat for the winter, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.660" end="01:07:20.200" style="s2">Everyone had shelter, and so on.</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.200" end="01:07:27.530" style="s2">So you figure, with regards to wealth, once<br />you’ve got running water, reliable shelter,</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.530" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">heat, and maybe air conditioning if you live<br />in the desert, and you’re not hungry, you’ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">got ninety percent of what wealth can deliver.</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:37.910" style="s2">Really, all things considered.</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.910" end="01:07:46.329" style="s2">The rest of it is just status and luxury items,<br />but the relationship between position of status</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.329" end="01:07:50.500" style="s2">and death rates remain constant.</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.500" end="01:07:54.710" style="s2">So that’s very interesting, and we know<br />that that’s true from a lot of other studies</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.710" end="01:07:55.710" style="s2">as well.</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.710" end="01:08:00.450" style="s2">It’s like control for absolute wealth, there’s<br />still problems with hierarchy, and that seems</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.450" end="01:08:05.020" style="s2">mediated at least in part by serotonin, and<br />serotonin regulates negative emotion, and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.020" end="01:08:08.819" style="s2">the more negative emotion that you experience,<br />the more cortisol you produce, and cortisol</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.819" end="01:08:13.640" style="s2">in high levels is toxic and suppresses your<br />immune system so your brain gets damaged,</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.640" end="01:08:17.309" style="s2">and you gain weight and you get diabetes,<br />and maybe develop Alzheimer’s disease and</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.309" end="01:08:22.130" style="s2">are maybe more prone to cancer and heart disease,<br />and that’s just not good.</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.130" end="01:08:32.779" style="s2">Now that serotonergic mechanism is really<br />old, and so you can give serotonin injections</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.779" end="01:08:36.989" style="s2">to unhappy lobsters and it cheers them right<br />up, at least behaviorally speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.989" end="01:08:40.911" style="s2">If they&#39;re defeated in a fight, and you give<br />them a serotonin injection, they’ll stand</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.911" end="01:08:43.710" style="s2">up tall, confident and they’ll fight again.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.710" end="01:08:48.339" style="s2">I’m telling you that for a very specific<br />reason.</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.339" end="01:08:53.109" style="s2">One of the things we’ve been asking about<br />is well how might you conceptualize moral</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.109" end="01:08:55.880" style="s2">systems and how might you conceptualize evolution?</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.880" end="01:09:03.650" style="s2">One of the propositions was there are playable<br />games and non-playable games.</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.650" end="01:09:05.270" style="s2">Well here’s a playable game.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.270" end="01:09:06.520" style="s2">Dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.520" end="01:09:10.580" style="s2">We’ve been playing it for four hundred million<br />years.</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.580" end="01:09:12.290" style="s2">It’s stable.</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.290" end="01:09:19.130" style="s2">Now, it’s so stable that even lobsters have<br />them, but even worse is that the biochemical</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.130" end="01:09:28.330" style="s2">systems the lobsters use act within the dominance<br />hierarchy and react to, it’s the same in</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.330" end="01:09:29.390" style="s2">us.</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.390" end="01:09:36.359" style="s2">And so, not only is that stable, it’s well<br />ridiculously stable.</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.359" end="01:09:43.620" style="s2">So one of the things we could say is that<br />one of the games that seems emergent and real</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.620" end="01:09:44.850" style="s2">is a dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.850" end="01:09:49.980" style="s2">And then we might ask what exactly constitutes<br />a dominance hierarchy, and we might ask well</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.980" end="01:09:55.409" style="s2">what constitutes a highly functional hierarchy<br />versus a dysfunctional hierarchy, and even</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.409" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">what does highly functional and dysfunctional<br />mean.</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:01.070" style="s2">Well we have to define all those terms.</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.070" end="01:10:02.840" style="s2">We will, as we move forward.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.840" end="01:10:08.560" style="s2">But the point I’m making is - and this is<br />a bit of a contradiction with the initial</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.560" end="01:10:14.640" style="s2">system I made with the tight distinction between<br />the scientific world and the objective world</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.640" end="01:10:21.510" style="s2">because I’m also talking about the evolution<br />of games, and you know, the study of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.510" end="01:10:28.030" style="s2">is a scientific study and the dominance hierarchy<br />is a biological phenomena and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.030" end="01:10:32.040" style="s2">it’s also a game, and it’s also a moral<br />structure and so there are levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.040" end="01:10:35.540" style="s2">where these things start to get tangled together,<br />and that’s partly what we’ll try to sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.540" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">out.</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:42.989" style="s2">So, we’ll do that in the future because<br />it’s very very complicated.</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.989" end="01:10:53.590" style="s2">Alright now we’re gonna step back a little<br />bit.</p>
