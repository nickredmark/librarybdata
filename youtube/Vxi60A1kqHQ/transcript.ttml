<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">scam in the history of mankind they say</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:28.469" style="s2">truth is that the modern banking system</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:30.929" style="s2">creates currency far faster than trees</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.469" end="00:01:33.899" style="s2">can grow most people don&#39;t have a clue</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.929" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">how currency is created economists and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.899" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">bankers make it sound so complex that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">people think they can&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.539" style="s2">but I&#39;m going to strip our monetary</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:44.429" style="s2">system down to its essence so that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.539" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">can see the scam behind the curtain and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.429" end="00:01:48.869" style="s2">just how it affects you every modern</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">society creates currency in pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.869" end="00:01:53.129" style="s2">the same way but since the u.s. dollar</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:54.959" style="s2">is the majority of the world&#39;s currency</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.129" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use the United States as</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.959" end="00:01:59.129" style="s2">our example it all starts when some</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:00.539" style="s2">politician says vote for me and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.129" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">make sure the government provides you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.539" end="00:02:05.789" style="s2">more free stuff than my opponent but</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:07.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.789" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">to provide that supposedly free stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">the politicians vote for the country to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:14.549" style="s2">spend more than its income this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">called deficit spending to pay for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.549" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">deficit spending the Treasury borrows</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">currency by issuing a bond so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:25.799" style="s2">bond if you think about it a bond is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:27.239" style="s2">really nothing but a glorified IOU it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.799" end="00:02:29.489" style="s2">a pretty piece of paper with numbers</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.239" end="00:02:31.290" style="s2">printed eyes that says loan me a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.489" end="00:02:33.359" style="s2">trillion dollars today and I promise</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">over a 10-year period I&#39;m going to pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.359" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">you back that trillion dollars plus</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">interest but what you need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">is that Treasury bonds are our national</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">debt these glorified IOUs are to be paid</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:49.530" style="s2">back by you and I and our descendants</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:51.630" style="s2">through future taxation therefore when</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.530" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">the government issues a bond it steals</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.630" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">prosperity out of the future so that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:02:57.299" style="s2">can spend it today</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:02:59.819" style="s2">the Treasury then holds a bond auction</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.299" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">and the world&#39;s largest banks show up</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.819" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">and compete to buy part of our national</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.849" style="s2">debt and make a profit on it by earning</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:07.980" style="s2">interest you&#39;ll notice that as we move</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.849" end="00:03:10.230" style="s2">through this process the big banks are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.980" end="00:03:12.840" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a cut every step of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.230" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">way this isn&#39;t by chance as you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.840" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">shortly then through a shell game called</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:18.620" style="s2">open market operations the banks get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:21.319" style="s2">sell some of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.620" end="00:03:22.730" style="s2">to the Federal Reserve at a profit to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.319" end="00:03:24.860" style="s2">pay for the bonds the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.730" end="00:03:28.459" style="s2">opens up its big old checkbook and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.860" end="00:03:30.409" style="s2">writes bad bogus counterfeit checks that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.459" end="00:03:32.420" style="s2">should bounce because they draw on an</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.409" end="00:03:34.909" style="s2">account that always has a zero balance</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.420" end="00:03:37.159" style="s2">there isn&#39;t one penny in there to quote</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.909" end="00:03:38.599" style="s2">from the Boston Federal Reserve when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.159" end="00:03:41.180" style="s2">or I write a check there must be</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.599" end="00:03:43.099" style="s2">sufficient funds in our account to cover</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.180" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2">that check but when the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.099" end="00:03:48.590" style="s2">writes a check there is no bank deposit</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.190" end="00:03:50.629" style="s2">on which that check is drawn when the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.590" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">Federal Reserve writes a check it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.629" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">creating money the Fed then hands those</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:57.859" style="s2">checks to the banks and at this point</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:04:00.109" style="s2">currency springs into existence the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.859" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">banks then take that currency and buy</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.109" end="00:04:04.940" style="s2">more bonds at the next treasury auction</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:07.340" style="s2">but what is a check a check is also an</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.940" end="00:04:09.739" style="s2">IOU when you write a check you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.340" end="00:04:11.690" style="s2">a note that says here&#39;s my IOU for cash</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.739" end="00:04:14.450" style="s2">all you have to do is go to the bank and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.690" end="00:04:16.820" style="s2">pick it up now it&#39;s very very important</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.450" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">that you understand this process because</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.820" end="00:04:20.329" style="s2">we&#39;re going to come back later and show</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:23.419" style="s2">you the devastating effect this has on</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.329" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">you the Treasury issues IOUs</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.419" end="00:04:28.849" style="s2">bonds the banks then by those IOUs with</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:31.639" style="s2">currency the Federal Reserve then writes</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.849" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">IOUs checks and hands them to the banks</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.639" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">in exchange for the Treasury&#39;s i/o use</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:38.690" style="s2">the bonds and currency is created so</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.190" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening is the Federal</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.690" end="00:04:42.919" style="s2">Reserve and the Treasury are just</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:45.340" style="s2">swapping io u--&#39;s using the banks as</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.919" end="00:04:47.510" style="s2">middlemen and abracadabra presto</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.340" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">currency magically springs into</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.510" end="00:04:52.130" style="s2">existence this process repeats and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:54.050" style="s2">repeats over and over again enriching</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.130" end="00:04:56.930" style="s2">the banks and indebting the public by</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.050" end="00:04:58.849" style="s2">raising the national debt the end result</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.930" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a buildup of bonds at</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.849" end="00:05:03.320" style="s2">the Federal Reserve and currency at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">Treasury this process is also where all</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:07.810" style="s2">from the federal reserve in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.810" end="00:05:12.280" style="s2">baseline because they didn&#39;t watch</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.760" end="00:05:13.990" style="s2">episode 1 of this series and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.280" end="00:05:17.200" style="s2">know the difference between money and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.990" end="00:05:19.090" style="s2">currency but I will correctly refer to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.200" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">it as base currency because it is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.090" end="00:05:24.580" style="s2">money it is currency and as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">learned there is a big difference money</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.580" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">has to be a store of value and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:31.030" style="s2">its purchasing power over long periods</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">of time we learned an episode one that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.030" end="00:05:35.110" style="s2">earlier in our history our paper</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:37.030" style="s2">currency was just a claim check it was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.110" end="00:05:39.190" style="s2">representation for real money of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.030" end="00:05:41.740" style="s2">intrinsic value the gold and silver that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:43.960" style="s2">was held on deposit of the Treasury you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.740" end="00:05:46.450" style="s2">could walk into any bank and slap your</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.960" end="00:05:48.790" style="s2">currency like say a $20 bill on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.450" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">counter and redeem it for real money a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.790" end="00:05:53.410" style="s2">twenty dollar gold piece but now this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">base currency that&#39;s piling up back here</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.410" end="00:05:59.530" style="s2">is really nothing but a receipt or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">claim check on an IOU that bond so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.530" end="00:06:03.610" style="s2">really nothing but a supply of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:04.990" style="s2">the Treasury then deposits the newly</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.610" end="00:06:06.760" style="s2">created currency into the various</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.990" end="00:06:09.220" style="s2">branches of the government and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.760" end="00:06:11.050" style="s2">politicians say hey thanks for that and</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.570" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">is in black and white from the Fed</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.600" end="00:08:01.130" style="s2">numbers are very different from base</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:04.070" style="s2">currency numbers because they only exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.130" end="00:08:06.020" style="s2">in computers they are still currency so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.070" end="00:08:09.139" style="s2">now there is one hundred and ninety</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.020" end="00:08:11.030" style="s2">dollars in existence now the reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.139" end="00:08:12.860" style="s2">people take out loans from the banks is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.030" end="00:08:16.490" style="s2">to buy something they&#39;re going to buy a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.860" end="00:08:18.860" style="s2">house or a car or something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.490" end="00:08:21.949" style="s2">the borrower takes the $90 of the bank</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.860" end="00:08:24.410" style="s2">loan to him from your account and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.949" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">pays the seller of the item but then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.410" end="00:08:29.510" style="s2">seller deposits that currency into his</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:31.760" style="s2">account and his bank loans out 90% of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.510" end="00:08:35.330" style="s2">that and leaves bank credit numbers in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.760" end="00:08:37.580" style="s2">its place so now there&#39;s 271 dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.330" end="00:08:39.409" style="s2">existence this process repeats and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.580" end="00:08:42.380" style="s2">repeats until under a 10 percent reserve</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.409" end="00:08:45.860" style="s2">ratio an initial deposit of just 100</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.380" end="00:08:49.430" style="s2">dollars can create up to $1,000 of bank</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.860" end="00:08:53.300" style="s2">credit all backed by $100 of vault cash</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.430" end="00:08:56.750" style="s2">just 10% but as I said reserve ratios</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.300" end="00:08:59.720" style="s2">vary wildly on some deposits it&#39;s 10% on</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.750" end="00:09:01.880" style="s2">others it&#39;s 3% and on some funds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.720" end="00:09:04.490" style="s2">deposits reserve requirements are zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">the result is that the expansion of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.490" end="00:09:08.510" style="s2">currency supply by the bank is far</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:11.750" style="s2">greater than even this example would</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.510" end="00:09:13.640" style="s2">lead you to believe so once again when</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.750" end="00:09:16.040" style="s2">currency is deposited in the bank</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.640" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">the banks get to lend it out and then it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.040" end="00:09:21.170" style="s2">gets redeposited and relent redeposited</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">and relent redeposited and relent</p>
