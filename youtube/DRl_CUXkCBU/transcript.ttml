<p begin="00:00:02.490" end="00:00:08.990" style="s2">out there just to see if the tools work</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">rather than if the content is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.990" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">fairly often yeah not so fairly often I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">mean it&#39;s fun for you right yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:23.670" style="s2">Twitter is entertainment I mean as much</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">as information so but the way I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.670" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">frame it is to say it&#39;s a a/b testing so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s basically just another word</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">for what you said but I do put things</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">out and say oh I have a theory about</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">this one that I think this one will go</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">back Niq or we&#39;re talking about content</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">well they&#39;re inseparable your content is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">part of the technique okay right but if</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">I put something out there that&#39;s got all</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">kinds of technique I do watch it to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">if I was right and so for example a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.670" style="s2">typical viral tweet would be something</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">that&#39;s in the news that day something</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.670" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">that people are really talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.829" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it that makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:09.450" style="s2">people talk and then you you make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">clever connection or a joke sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">connecting it to something else they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">talking about like if you could tie you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">know impeachment to the State of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">Union in a clever way or anything the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">people just recognize that is humor and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">they laugh so when I put those kinds out</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">they&#39;re very formulaic and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">ones I watched the most because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">seeing if the formula still works</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">interesting and it does and it still</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">works it&#39;s very consistent Americans</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">yeah and by the way we met you Jack</p>

<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">thinks of it this way but he has so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:47.149" style="s2">technique in his tweets it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">coincidence that they do well yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.149" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">I&#39;m saying jack has been on fire and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched him go from you know some</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.630" style="s2">sort of five figure number of followers</p>

<p begin="00:02:15.310" end="00:02:19.750" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s better because he</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.459" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">always looks like he&#39;s enjoying himself</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.970" end="00:02:29.379" style="s2">such a good life and I&#39;m proud of him</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.530" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">and really happy to see that was there</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.379" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">was there a formula or something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:39.129" style="s2">did work for you before that has died</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:40.209" style="s2">and is there is there like a hmm if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.129" end="00:02:41.799" style="s2">know if you come to market with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.209" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">product and everybody comes to mark with</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.799" end="00:02:44.739" style="s2">the same product that kind of dilutes</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:47.110" style="s2">the value is there has there been a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.739" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">technique that that worked that that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.110" end="00:02:51.069" style="s2">been extinguished because it just been</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:54.489" style="s2">trampled by other people or well there</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.069" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">are some things to get overused the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.489" end="00:02:57.910" style="s2">one that I&#39;m watching now is and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">used it a number of times because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.910" end="00:03:03.190" style="s2">always funny narrator voice if you do a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:05.560" style="s2">tweet you just say narrator :</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.190" end="00:03:08.049" style="s2">whatever you say after narrator is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.560" end="00:03:09.610" style="s2">almost always going to be funny it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.049" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">just it&#39;s one of those formulas that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.610" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">almost always works</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:18.100" style="s2">yeah how I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:21.579" style="s2">get funnier Scott and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.100" end="00:03:24.040" style="s2">working for me I&#39;ve even read books on</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.579" end="00:03:26.859" style="s2">how to be funny and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.040" end="00:03:28.630" style="s2">because there&#39;s there are formulas there</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.859" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">is a technique to it and there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.630" end="00:03:32.530" style="s2">structures that that work time and time</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:35.290" style="s2">and time again and one of them is using</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.530" end="00:03:36.940" style="s2">the character right as if you present a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.290" end="00:03:40.269" style="s2">character saying something then that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.940" end="00:03:42.340" style="s2">character has one or two characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.269" end="00:03:43.720" style="s2">and they just whatever they say or do</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.340" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">matches with those characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.720" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">people tend to think that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.730" end="00:03:49.959" style="s2">funny it&#39;s just like a program that hits</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">in people&#39;s brains</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.959" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">do you have formal training and humor</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:56.440" style="s2">writing is that something you&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:58.569" style="s2">or do you evolved through this through a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.440" end="00:04:01.000" style="s2">and B testing or how did you get to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.569" end="00:04:03.669" style="s2">to that point you think so in my early</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.000" end="00:04:06.549" style="s2">days it was just trial and error but</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.669" end="00:04:08.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve developed the formula a thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.549" end="00:04:11.889" style="s2">wait to sneeze in a minute so just</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.380" end="00:04:21.190" style="s2">warning you I&#39;ll get Rosie to mark right</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.889" end="00:04:23.290" style="s2">then but so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.190" end="00:04:24.910" style="s2">you could google this to see the details</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.290" end="00:04:27.220" style="s2">but I wrote what I call the six</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.910" end="00:04:29.320" style="s2">dimensions of humor and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.220" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">you have to use at least two of the six</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.320" end="00:04:33.700" style="s2">dimensions or people who will not even</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">recognize it as humor mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.700" end="00:04:38.470" style="s2">now I always I always falter when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">trying to mention the six well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.470" end="00:04:48.640" style="s2">mention as many as I can remember for</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">example so clever bizarre naughty I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.640" end="00:04:53.020" style="s2">think of the others but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:54.640" style="s2">recognizable is another one so</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.020" end="00:04:57.160" style="s2">recognizable is probably the one you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.640" end="00:04:58.840" style="s2">were talking about so recognizable is if</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.160" end="00:05:00.790" style="s2">I take Dilbert and I put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.840" end="00:05:03.220" style="s2">situation which other people have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.790" end="00:05:05.410" style="s2">in they say oh my boss does that to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.220" end="00:05:07.810" style="s2">all the time I have one dimension but</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.410" end="00:05:09.400" style="s2">then I&#39;ve got to do something clever or</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.810" end="00:05:12.100" style="s2">naughty so in other words the punchline</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.400" end="00:05:14.110" style="s2">is something you know something heard</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:17.020" style="s2">him in his butt or there was you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.110" end="00:05:18.550" style="s2">some vague you know sexual problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.020" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">that&#39;s not specified because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.550" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">comic but you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.780" end="00:05:25.960" style="s2">there or it&#39;s a clever almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">engineering solution in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.960" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have normally worked but does</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:32.860" style="s2">so if you put together two out of three</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:35.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve got something the best the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.860" end="00:05:38.380" style="s2">cartoonists in the world would start</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.410" end="00:05:40.570" style="s2">with two so if you look at carve Calvin</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.380" end="00:05:44.169" style="s2">and Hobbes two of the dimensions are</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.570" end="00:05:48.340" style="s2">acute and bizarre Calvin and Hobbes had</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.169" end="00:05:49.960" style="s2">a cute little kid and a tiger but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.340" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">tiger was sometimes a tiger and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.960" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">sometimes it was stopped so that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">bizarre plus there was kid who sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">talk like an adult that was bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">so Watterson would start with two</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:03.970" style="s2">dimensions before he even wrote a joke</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a coincidence that he had</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.970" end="00:06:09.460" style="s2">the most you know probably the best most</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:11.880" style="s2">people would say comic of all time</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.460" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">and the farside did would had the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.880" end="00:06:17.950" style="s2">advantage people at people I did a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.120" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2">little tweet a little tweets that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.950" end="00:06:20.380" style="s2">going to talk to Scott any questions for</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:22.419" style="s2">him and one of the questions that came</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.380" end="00:06:26.919" style="s2">up the most was did have you ever met</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.419" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">Watterson and now he is famous as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.919" end="00:06:31.669" style="s2">recluse and neither of us have ever made</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:34.969" style="s2">an attempt to meet the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.669" end="00:06:37.849" style="s2">um I have this thing this mic my kids</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.969" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">they tell me oh I send memes back and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.849" end="00:06:41.150" style="s2">forth we have this whole collection of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:42.860" style="s2">memes while we do all day send each</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.150" end="00:06:44.810" style="s2">other memes memes memes memes names</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.860" end="00:06:46.969" style="s2">names now I understand memes to be an</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.810" end="00:06:49.400" style="s2">idea but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.969" end="00:06:53.389" style="s2">memes it being changed for the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.400" end="00:06:56.120" style="s2">comic now they&#39;re like one panel comics</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.389" end="00:07:00.349" style="s2">is there a relationship there or am I am</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.120" end="00:07:03.409" style="s2">I missing that well the memes usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.349" end="00:07:05.389" style="s2">have a message yeah whereas comics</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.409" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">sometimes are just trying to be funny</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.389" end="00:07:11.539" style="s2">I think the meme is usually has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2">utility or a function so you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.539" end="00:07:15.889" style="s2">to mock somebody you don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.400" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">reduce their power so there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.889" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">something you&#39;re trying to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:22.819" style="s2">with a meme that a comic is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.580" end="00:07:25.099" style="s2">entertain interesting are the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.819" end="00:07:26.449" style="s2">interesting entertaining comics ones</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.099" end="00:07:30.949" style="s2">that do have a message in them though</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.449" end="00:07:33.229" style="s2">like something or now well it depends</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.949" end="00:07:35.270" style="s2">you know in Dilbert comics I owe the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.229" end="00:07:37.189" style="s2">message that&#39;s sort of embedded in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.270" end="00:07:39.800" style="s2">of it is that management is silly and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.189" end="00:07:41.389" style="s2">people are irrational and you know we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.800" end="00:07:42.979" style="s2">things for the wrong reasons we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.389" end="00:07:46.250" style="s2">know why we&#39;re doing it but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.979" end="00:07:48.229" style="s2">so much a social message yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.250" end="00:07:50.060" style="s2">tried to put tried to be too preachy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.229" end="00:07:52.460" style="s2">a comic I don&#39;t think it would work so</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.060" end="00:07:54.289" style="s2">the you bring a subtext is really</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.460" end="00:07:56.419" style="s2">important and humor right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.289" end="00:07:59.089" style="s2">message that gets transmitted that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.419" end="00:08:00.830" style="s2">over and the messaging do you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.089" end="00:08:03.139" style="s2">about subtext when you&#39;re crafting your</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.830" end="00:08:05.389" style="s2">tweets and such or do you just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.139" end="00:08:06.949" style="s2">you have like I imagine you&#39;re just so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.389" end="00:08:09.319" style="s2">experienced now that you can just fire</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.949" end="00:08:11.330" style="s2">them off the subtext comes out on its</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.319" end="00:08:12.889" style="s2">own or do you ever do you have a system</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.330" end="00:08:15.169" style="s2">or a process for that do you ever think</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.889" end="00:08:18.349" style="s2">subtext first and then how do i how do i</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.169" end="00:08:20.810" style="s2">express that or i&#39;ve done it in every</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.349" end="00:08:23.779" style="s2">direction but the most common direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.810" end="00:08:26.509" style="s2">that&#39;s 95% of the time i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.779" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">that i start with a situation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.509" end="00:08:30.229" style="s2">something happens usually it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.089" style="s2">in the real world that could happen to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.229" end="00:08:34.250" style="s2">somebody that&#39;s so I get one dimension</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.089" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">so I want to nail the first dimension</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.250" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">this like oh you had that happen to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.169" end="00:08:40.849" style="s2">and the second dimension could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:42.349" style="s2">anything and if I and if I can add a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.849" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">third dimension then it&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.349" end="00:08:49.070" style="s2">home run so it&#39;s usually I just built it</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">from situation what layer is automatic</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.070" end="00:08:53.630" style="s2">and then what layer can I add to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:56.180" style="s2">fascinating to me how there is actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.630" end="00:08:58.970" style="s2">system an actual system to being funny</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.180" end="00:09:01.310" style="s2">you you go to watch a comedian do</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.970" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">stand-up and because the good ones are</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.310" end="00:09:05.270" style="s2">so good at it it feels like also when</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:06.410" style="s2">you&#39;re reading a book feels like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.270" end="00:09:09.560" style="s2">just sitting there talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.410" end="00:09:11.779" style="s2">they&#39;re just riffing and but really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.560" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">such an asymmetric experience right I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.779" end="00:09:16.970" style="s2">read your book and frankly I find your</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:19.399" style="s2">writing to just be so accessible it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.970" end="00:09:21.350" style="s2">clear it&#39;s it&#39;s fantastic and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.399" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">caught up in trying to sound fancy or</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.350" end="00:09:25.370" style="s2">anything which in and of itself is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:29.149" style="s2">fanciness that most people can&#39;t grasp</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.370" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">clarity is very difficult but it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.149" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">an asymmetric experience your book was</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:34.940" style="s2">written in a draft and ran out on and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:36.290" style="s2">then a draft and then a draft another</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.940" end="00:09:38.120" style="s2">draft it was edited and revised I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.290" end="00:09:39.410" style="s2">done it a ton for every paragraph you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.120" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">know there&#39;s 50 paragraphs that went</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.410" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">before it and but when you&#39;re reading it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:49.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like it just an instantaneous flow</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">have you ever reflected upon that and is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.730" end="00:09:53.750" style="s2">there any sort of relevance in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:54.829" style="s2">the way I don&#39;t really know where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.750" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">going that so they&#39;re just to make this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.829" end="00:10:00.170" style="s2">observation is that the best sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:03.980" style="s2">writing and communication seems simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.170" end="00:10:06.200" style="s2">and clear but yet there&#39;s like an army</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.980" end="00:10:08.450" style="s2">of work that went behind it yeah very</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.200" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">interesting relationship between creator</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.450" end="00:10:13.910" style="s2">and consumer very asymmetric and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.670" style="s2">the effort that you have to put in so</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.910" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">one of the reasons that I added</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.670" end="00:10:20.390" style="s2">persuasion to my tellers stack is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">as a writer it makes all of your writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.390" end="00:10:25.790" style="s2">more accessible so learning to write</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">simple direct sentences is really about</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">understanding how the brain works and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2">the cleanest example that is if I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">you have a choice of these two sentences</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.600" end="00:10:38.149" style="s2">you&#39;re going to write about and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:40.730" style="s2">first one is the the ball was hit by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.149" end="00:10:43.010" style="s2">boy and then the second sentence which</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.730" end="00:10:45.410" style="s2">means exactly the same thing the boy the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.010" end="00:10:47.209" style="s2">boy hit the ball yeah now if I say to an</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.410" end="00:10:49.610" style="s2">on writer which of those is the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.209" end="00:10:51.050" style="s2">way they might say well I&#39;ve heard that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.610" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">a direct sentence is better but</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.050" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">basically they say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.560" style="s2">so I&#39;d say they&#39;re about equal yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">here&#39;s what the persuader knows that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.560" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">your brain is wired to</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:04.970" style="s2">want to hear this the person first the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:06.889" style="s2">boy now I&#39;ve imagined a boy now tell me</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.970" end="00:11:08.809" style="s2">what the boy is doing he&#39;s hitting a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.889" end="00:11:10.939" style="s2">ball if you do it the other way the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.809" end="00:11:13.939" style="s2">brain has to work harder the ball was</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.939" end="00:11:15.529" style="s2">hit by what what okay the boy now I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.939" end="00:11:18.410" style="s2">to play it in Reverse because now I know</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.529" end="00:11:21.199" style="s2">who started it and then I can replay it</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.410" end="00:11:22.879" style="s2">so it&#39;s twice as much work to process</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">the ball was hit by the boy compared to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.879" end="00:11:27.860" style="s2">the boy at the ball once you learn all</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:30.589" style="s2">of those simple little wiring truths</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.860" end="00:11:33.579" style="s2">about a brain you learn things like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.589" end="00:11:36.559" style="s2">only remember 10% of what we experienced</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.579" end="00:11:39.410" style="s2">you know I could go on but and and if</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.559" end="00:11:41.209" style="s2">you if you make a long sentence people</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.410" end="00:11:42.379" style="s2">are just gonna get bored and tired and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.209" end="00:11:46.100" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna wonder why it was so long</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.379" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">so I just don&#39;t and it also people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.100" end="00:11:52.459" style="s2">process adjectives and adverbs so if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:55.309" style="s2">were gonna write something let&#39;s say in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.459" end="00:11:57.649" style="s2">a business context and you wrote it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.309" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">very hot yesterday well when you write</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.649" end="00:12:01.490" style="s2">it you say to yourself I need to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.860" style="s2">very hot because I want them to know</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.490" end="00:12:06.559" style="s2">like it&#39;s not just ah eighty degrees</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.860" end="00:12:08.749" style="s2">it&#39;s very hot well but what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.559" end="00:12:10.549" style="s2">persuader and the and a good writer</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.749" end="00:12:12.949" style="s2">knows is that that person&#39;s doctor</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.549" end="00:12:15.230" style="s2">remember the word very right they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.949" end="00:12:16.519" style="s2">remember it was hot so you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.230" end="00:12:17.809" style="s2">just get rid of all the words that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.519" end="00:12:20.269" style="s2">people aren&#39;t going to remember after</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.809" end="00:12:22.369" style="s2">they&#39;ve read it and and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.269" end="00:12:23.929" style="s2">clean and simple yeah and as a reader</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.369" end="00:12:26.119" style="s2">you can tell when you hit a passage that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.929" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t hasn&#39;t been well done because your</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.119" end="00:12:29.749" style="s2">eyes start to skip over the words a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">little bit and then you&#39;re like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.749" end="00:12:32.629" style="s2">start think about something else and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.100" end="00:12:34.040" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh why did I just read a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.629" end="00:12:36.769" style="s2">paragraph I don&#39;t even I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:39.679" style="s2">what I read that this the best advice I</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.769" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">ever got was just strong nouns strong</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.679" end="00:12:44.569" style="s2">verbs and if you can just remember that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:46.279" style="s2">it sounds so simple but yet people screw</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.569" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">it up all the time everywhere you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.279" end="00:12:49.399" style="s2">there&#39;s so much trash writing out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:51.319" style="s2">that you would think that nobody had</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.399" end="00:12:52.790" style="s2">ever heard that simple principle ever in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.319" end="00:12:56.420" style="s2">their whole life why is it so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.790" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">write so simply Scott well I think if</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.420" end="00:13:01.670" style="s2">you take a writing class in college they</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:03.410" style="s2">teach you to write complicated yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.670" end="00:13:05.119" style="s2">there&#39;s some sense that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.410" end="00:13:08.209" style="s2">sort of academic and a certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.119" end="00:13:09.529" style="s2">vocabulary etc but the the genius of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.209" end="00:13:13.160" style="s2">writing is to write it so everybody</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.529" end="00:13:15.259" style="s2">knows what the words mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.160" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">you you and I are a professional writers</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.259" end="00:13:19.339" style="s2">of a certain age I would say that my</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:20.990" style="s2">vocabulary if you were to you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.339" end="00:13:23.209" style="s2">compare to let&#39;s say just the average</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.990" end="00:13:25.639" style="s2">public probably in the top one percent</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.209" end="00:13:27.199" style="s2">just because I do this for a living you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.639" end="00:13:30.139" style="s2">know words or words or what I do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.199" end="00:13:32.899" style="s2">still I could be reading something on</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.139" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">CNN website not so much CNN but just</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.899" end="00:13:38.120" style="s2">some some article and I&#39;ll run into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.029" end="00:13:39.050" style="s2">word I don&#39;t know and I think that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.050" end="00:13:44.329" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not my fault right right so</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:47.029" style="s2">somebody&#39;s at fault it&#39;s not me right</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.329" end="00:13:48.769" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it just think the bigger the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.029" end="00:13:50.360" style="s2">vocabulary or have you realized the less</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.769" end="00:13:51.860" style="s2">useful it becomes a time sink because</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.360" end="00:13:54.379" style="s2">you can&#39;t really drop those words in</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.860" end="00:13:57.589" style="s2">there one of the things that your</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.379" end="00:13:59.180" style="s2">influence on me has one of the you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.589" end="00:14:01.670" style="s2">influenced me tremendously may use some</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.180" end="00:14:05.720" style="s2">strong strong now strong verbs and one</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.670" end="00:14:08.660" style="s2">of them was systems before goals and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.720" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">another one all of them sort of just fit</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.660" end="00:14:13.550" style="s2">around a mindset and then the final one</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">was really about thinking of mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.550" end="00:14:17.509" style="s2">models of the world and and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">remember I think you might have been the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.509" end="00:14:21.139" style="s2">one to introduce me to this just that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.279" style="s2">phrase mental model of the world mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.139" end="00:14:25.279" style="s2">model of the world mental model of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.279" end="00:14:27.889" style="s2">world being broken and I had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.279" end="00:14:30.649" style="s2">taken that to heart that my perceptive</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.889" end="00:14:34.040" style="s2">tools this the the ideas I were I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.649" end="00:14:36.199" style="s2">given the frame of reference I had none</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.040" end="00:14:38.389" style="s2">of that seemed to be producing anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.199" end="00:14:40.310" style="s2">that made any sense to me anymore like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.389" end="00:14:43.189" style="s2">I&#39;m having trouble or has having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.310" end="00:14:46.279" style="s2">making sense of the world do you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.189" end="00:14:48.439" style="s2">our mental models that we&#39;ve had up</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.279" end="00:14:50.600" style="s2">until now are kind of broken</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.439" end="00:14:55.339" style="s2">do they need updating desire does our</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.600" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">operating software need updating well I</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.339" end="00:14:59.509" style="s2">have said that in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:02.600" style="s2">that our whole understanding of reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.509" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">is going to change and I think politics</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.600" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">have changed that because we understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:08.899" style="s2">the facts don&#39;t matter anymore yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:11.240" style="s2">just keep saying one example after</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.899" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">another where somebody can just make up</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.240" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">facts and it didn&#39;t really change</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:17.689" style="s2">anything and and so I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">biggest understanding is that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.689" end="00:15:22.279" style="s2">living in some kind of a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:24.889" style="s2">world now on top of that you&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.279" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">big movement toward the psychedelics so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.889" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">people using mushrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:34.060" style="s2">micro dosing LSD and this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:37.250" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s further</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.060" end="00:15:39.260" style="s2">emphasizing that reality is subjective</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:40.820" style="s2">because if you do mushrooms for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.260" end="00:15:42.830" style="s2">I&#39;m not recommending it and just tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.820" end="00:15:44.810" style="s2">you what it what it feels like it feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:46.790" style="s2">like you&#39;ve entered a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:48.650" style="s2">world but yet it works</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.790" end="00:15:50.450" style="s2">you still can take a drink of water or</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.650" end="00:15:52.490" style="s2">you could still you know where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.450" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">bathroom is everything works but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.490" end="00:15:56.210" style="s2">like you&#39;re seeing it for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">yeah once you have that experience even</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.210" end="00:16:00.770" style="s2">once you realize that the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:04.820" style="s2">experience is it an interpretation and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.770" end="00:16:07.070" style="s2">not and not a infinitely accurate view</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.820" end="00:16:08.630" style="s2">of the world and where are you getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.070" end="00:16:10.700" style="s2">evidence that people are more interested</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.630" end="00:16:12.590" style="s2">in psychedelics than they were before I</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.700" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">mean my first thought was like 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.590" end="00:16:16.940" style="s2">and the electric kool-aid acid test that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">seemed like a real phenomenon is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.940" end="00:16:19.850" style="s2">really is this is this just like among</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">your friends out there in the West Coast</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.850" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">out here in DC I don&#39;t hear anybody</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:25.510" style="s2">talking about that oh yeah in Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.800" style="s2">Valley</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.510" end="00:16:30.230" style="s2">probably everybody beyond a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.800" end="00:16:32.630" style="s2">level successes has done some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:35.240" style="s2">psychedelics and it probably does about</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.630" end="00:16:39.710" style="s2">a regular basis it&#39;s as it&#39;s as common</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.240" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">as as drinking probably and so it might</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.710" end="00:16:42.640" style="s2">be different here but what I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:45.650" style="s2">about actually was the medical</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.640" end="00:16:49.580" style="s2">therapeutic uses because there there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.650" end="00:16:51.980" style="s2">people who are experiencing breaking you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.580" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">know alcohol and opioid addictions after</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.980" end="00:16:58.070" style="s2">one dose of low dose of like psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:17:00.170" style="s2">or of LSD or something yeah and several</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.070" end="00:17:03.290" style="s2">of those psychedelics have the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.170" end="00:17:05.720" style="s2">therapeutic value apparently so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.290" end="00:17:07.700" style="s2">seeing you know the laws are loosening</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.720" end="00:17:10.310" style="s2">up in some places you see more talk of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.700" end="00:17:13.400" style="s2">legalizing more talk of testing more</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.310" end="00:17:16.790" style="s2">studies coming out I would say in five</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.400" end="00:17:19.370" style="s2">years here&#39;s my prediction in five years</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.790" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">the the most common treatment for</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.370" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">alcoholism and addiction will be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:27.290" style="s2">psychedelic in five years that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:28.460" style="s2">interesting I have a lot of personal</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.290" end="00:17:30.790" style="s2">experience with psychedelics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.460" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">experimented with mushrooms and MDMA</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.790" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">especially back in the 90s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:38.390" style="s2">I will say without any doubt my</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:39.190" style="s2">experience with MDMA or ecstasy or Molly</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.390" end="00:17:41.470" style="s2">or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.190" end="00:17:43.870" style="s2">they&#39;re calling it these days completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.470" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">transform my ideas of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.870" end="00:17:49.870" style="s2">enhance my senses of empathy made me</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:51.550" style="s2">feel connected to other people in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.870" end="00:17:53.410" style="s2">that I hadn&#39;t ordinarily and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.550" end="00:17:55.900" style="s2">interestingly enough it was those</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.410" end="00:17:58.150" style="s2">experiences that really solidified me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.900" end="00:18:00.040" style="s2">think I was on the left to think that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.150" end="00:18:02.580" style="s2">was liberal and loved everybody and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.040" end="00:18:05.920" style="s2">became much more accepting of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.580" end="00:18:07.060" style="s2">and have just a variety of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.920" end="00:18:09.250" style="s2">you know of course we&#39;re hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.060" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">with people from the fringes at that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.250" end="00:18:13.420" style="s2">time of society so it was sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:15.970" style="s2">twilight space of culture you know like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.420" end="00:18:18.910" style="s2">the right before sunset and that weird</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.970" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">glow and it was just a I would highly</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.910" end="00:18:22.150" style="s2">recommend it but I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:25.270" style="s2">recommend it what can&#39;t recommend you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.150" end="00:18:28.660" style="s2">drugs on this podcast but it was hugely</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.270" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">influential on me and I know it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.660" end="00:18:35.020" style="s2">influential on you and even in your your</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:37.000" style="s2">persuasion book list where I think there</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.020" end="00:18:38.470" style="s2">were references to people that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.000" end="00:18:40.300" style="s2">maybe was Timothy Leary on there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.470" end="00:18:41.890" style="s2">know it&#39;s just sort of the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.300" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">opening your mind using drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.890" end="00:18:47.230" style="s2">alternate realities would you prescribe</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:49.180" style="s2">no you&#39;re not going to prescribe do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.230" end="00:18:52.810" style="s2">think that those types of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.180" end="00:18:54.520" style="s2">are essential to understanding just sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.810" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">of the environment that we live in and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.520" end="00:18:58.330" style="s2">this the the experience that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:18:59.980" style="s2">having in this universe well almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.330" end="00:19:02.140" style="s2">everybody who goes through these</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.980" end="00:19:04.840" style="s2">experiences says the same thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.140" end="00:19:06.900" style="s2">okay it&#39;s I&#39;m forever different now that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.840" end="00:19:09.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s not like having a drink yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.900" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">yeah you can get pretty drunk and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.310" end="00:19:14.560" style="s2">the same person after you&#39;re sober but</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:16.570" style="s2">you loosen again you do a loosen to gin</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.560" end="00:19:19.510" style="s2">once and your whole worldview will</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.570" end="00:19:21.070" style="s2">change and it won&#39;t go back so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.510" end="00:19:23.770" style="s2">the big difference yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.070" end="00:19:26.980" style="s2">interesting I doubt that our nation or</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.770" end="00:19:29.290" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll ever have widely accepted</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.980" end="00:19:32.560" style="s2">this notion that everybody needs to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.290" end="00:19:34.750" style="s2">a trip into its corner to come yeah let</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.560" end="00:19:35.890" style="s2">me just for the purpose of safety yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.750" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">there&#39;s not there&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.890" end="00:19:40.930" style="s2">mentioned that I think is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">without medical supervision and see if</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.930" end="00:19:45.370" style="s2">you have some underlying mental issues</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:47.950" style="s2">or you&#39;re on other kinds of drugs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.370" end="00:19:49.870" style="s2">some dangerous stuff so don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.950" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">lightly but I think the medical world</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.870" end="00:19:55.059" style="s2">will embrace this within five years</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:56.649" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve done a little bit over an</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.059" end="00:19:59.549" style="s2">hour here and I have a few more</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:17.290" style="s2">thousands and make my life miserable for</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.030" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">a while and mostly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.290" end="00:23:21.640" style="s2">inconvenience I don&#39;t like taking all</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:24.010" style="s2">the time to block them all so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.640" end="00:23:25.780" style="s2">taking my time but for some reason most</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.010" end="00:23:27.250" style="s2">of the professional trolls let have left</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.780" end="00:23:29.860" style="s2">me alone for the last month and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.250" end="00:23:31.620" style="s2">know why but they all just disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.860" end="00:23:34.270" style="s2">which also tells you they&#39;re organized</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.620" end="00:23:36.100" style="s2">there are organized if anybody is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.270" end="00:23:38.170" style="s2">listening to this who doesn&#39;t know both</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.100" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">both sides left and right have organized</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.170" end="00:23:42.340" style="s2">troll armies you don&#39;t always know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:44.830" style="s2">controlling them but you know when they</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.340" end="00:23:46.330" style="s2">arrive because they&#39;ll they all say the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.830" end="00:23:49.030" style="s2">same thing and they arrive at the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.330" end="00:23:51.280" style="s2">time so that those are all bad days the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.030" end="00:23:52.810" style="s2">best day by far and I think Twitter had</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.280" end="00:23:55.330" style="s2">a lot to do with it was getting invited</p>
