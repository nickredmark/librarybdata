<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">then the public part of it began then</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.000" end="00:00:35.920" style="s2">yes yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">so without further ado we are having</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.920" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">trouble on pretty much every channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:41.600" style="s2">uh but we are going to read those</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">questions that those super chat</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">questions that came in that have</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">only today this this first one that came</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:50.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">is evergreen adjacent but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.480" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">start there</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">based on tutoring experience i think i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:58.000" style="s2">be a good teacher but i see k-12 getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">infected with the same sjw virus as</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">higher ed</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">is there a way to teach in the us</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">without either having to lie</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">or ending up in your situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good question this is from</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">our friend holly mathnerd</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">um i think the answer is no except</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">if you broaden your definition of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">teaching and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:23.360" style="s2">i think at some level the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">the legacy system of teaching has</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">followed bad assumptions straight into</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:31.360" style="s2">and something is going to take its place</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">so the question is can you hold out</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.360" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">long enough for the new system whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">it might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">to to alert us to its existence</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">in the meantime you know heather</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">frequently makes the point</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">that most human societies don&#39;t involve</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">formal instruction</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">there is plenty of learning of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">learning is the core of what a human</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">being is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">but formal instruction is novel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">necessary for some topics but</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">in general it&#39;s not the way humans learn</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">figuring out how to teach in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">might not be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">labeled that would be a wise thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">in the meantime and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">when the educational apparatus or</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">whatever replaces it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">uh shows itself then you&#39;ll be already</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">um practiced this is indeed part of why</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">i look at that picture of our students</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">flinging mud at each other in the amazon</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">and say that&#39;s educational</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t look like top-down</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">authoritarian sage on the stage style</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">education but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">those people weren&#39;t learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">and that we didn&#39;t get them there</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">through a variety of different means and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">help them understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">what why there was value in it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">and all of that is educational even if</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">direct learning you know we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">directly no one no one i assumed</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">directly instructed any of those young</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">to throw mud at one another</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">but um but you know direct observation</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">and leaving room for serendipity these</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">are some of the most educational</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">uh openings available so when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">looks down their nose at you and says</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">guys if you&#39;re laughing you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">learning you have to listen for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">emoji</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">if there&#39;s an emoji maybe they&#39;re okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">if there&#39;s no emoji you just</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">run the other direction yeah so just one</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">more thing and answer this question</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">uh holly asks is there a way to teach in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">the u.s without having either to lie</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">or ending up in your situation and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">know lying</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:30.080" style="s2">um you know isn&#39;t something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">have to do anyway but i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">um you know we have we we know plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:35.120" style="s2">good teachers who are still trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve students and teachers in both</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">public and private schools in the k-12</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">and um they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">obscure their true feelings for</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">administrators but</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">they&#39;re just being constrained on all</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:55.439" style="s2">and some of them are trying to fight</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:56.799" style="s2">back within their institutions and some</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.439" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">of them are feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.799" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">too strongly and are looking for other</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">things to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">so if i can just add one more thing i</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">think it&#39;s so important um</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">during the evergreen riots a student of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">mine a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">current student at the time uh called my</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">attention to the story harrison bergeron</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">which many of you will have read kurt</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">vonnegut&#39;s story</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">that takes uh the intersectional point</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">um at some level to its logical extreme</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s about quality of outcome yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">about equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">through handicaps anyway she said you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">got to read this and i was like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t read it and she&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">no you have to read this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">um and uh anyway this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">student of color who actually went with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">me to the four o&#39;clock meeting</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">to defend me from my</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">newly discovered enemies but anyway she</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">was right about the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">we had a a teacher assign the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">to toby in his class yeah this year in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">eighth grade</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">yep it occurred to me that if i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">stuck in the system i would probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">engage in subversive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">like that they also he also got assigned</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">by the same teacher</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">uh to listen not watch but listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">entire album of pink floyd&#39;s the wall</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">pink this was a section uh this was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">section that this teacher had created</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">within the public school system</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">on dystopias yeah and as there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">other amazing things but those are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">two that i remember too the wall</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">and harrison bergeron yeah and for older</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">students i mean there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">shortage of subversive literature catch</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">birth by fire from your evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">experience you showed the world the dark</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">side of an ideology that ran away from</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">its core good purpose and descended into</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">madness</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">i&#39;m glad your new life includes us</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">could just send them a freeze-dried one</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">freeze-dried martini</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">um okay next question brett in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">previous podcast with eric</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">he robustly stated that he advised you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">to leave evergreen several times before</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">the meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">what was eric&#39;s main issue with task the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">evergreen state college</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">and what was your counter argument this</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">is this is good it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">a fair question yeah um eric never liked</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">my teaching or our teaching at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">yeah he didn&#39;t dislike your teaching he</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t like that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">or we were there right he thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">a waste of our time</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s one way in which you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">make that argument you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">get anywhere from evergreen it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">on the other hand you know eric</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">took a while to find a path through the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">and you have to do something in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">meantime and eric did several some</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">things in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">they were of a different nature but i</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t regret</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">teaching at evergreen because it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">marvelous environment if you had the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">right students in the room and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">that hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">work things out so that you did i</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">learned a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">i kept active in my field of interest</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">because evergreen allowed me to teach</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">evolution all the time and it allowed me</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">to teach it in whatever way i wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">never asked anything other than are your</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">students showing up or your class is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">full</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">i was able to keep my research life</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">without having to have a job at an r1</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.560" style="s2">university which would have been a death</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:31.599" style="s2">sentence anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.560" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">my basic feeling is given given the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.599" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">choices available</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">it provided an income it provided</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">a place to raise children that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">pretty healthy it provided</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">something to do every day that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">almost all the time it created uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">healthy relationships albeit you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">not necessarily with faculty colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">there were some friendships but</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">uh but we had lots of great exposure to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">people so i guess the point is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">what was the alternative it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">know eric didn&#39;t have some job to offer</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">so i had to go somewhere and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">regret it um i guess i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">uh add to that and maybe maybe modify a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">little bit because that makes it sound</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">we were just at some generic third-tier</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">liberal arts college</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">or it could have been a university right</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">evergreen is unique among institutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">of higher ed on this planet as far as i</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">can tell and we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">so you know there are other schools that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">have full-time classes but they last for</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">three weeks the block system that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">colorado college among others has</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">and there are other schools that do team</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">and there are other schools that banish</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">requirements so that students can really</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">delve into whatever it is that they want</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">to do but</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">uh evergreen is the only school that</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">does both those ladder things</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">and does full-time programs that last</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">for up to a full year so that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">really can build community with students</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">in a way that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">unknown in any other environment so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">that we found ourselves at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">third-rate institution</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">and just stayed there because it was in</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">a nice place and we could have children</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">and raise them there</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">and earned a salary that was never quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">enough but was fine</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">it was that actually and you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">were lucky</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">um you know i we&#39;re lucky to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">choose it like i you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">i i got to choose between the job at</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">evergreen and another academic job and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:21.839" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">actively we looked at the two options</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">the other one was a much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">prestigious</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">school with a much higher salary with</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">you know much greater ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">research and such</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">and we chose evergreen we chose to go to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">evergreen because of what it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">and because not only of the educational</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">because you would not just be teaching</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">rich kids that this socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">was actually so critical to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">coming into your own as an educator and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">actually understanding what what</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">modern humans are doing and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">thinking and what what they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">that this was this was not</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:01.040" style="s2">a cul-de-sac with regard to education</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:04.640" style="s2">it could easily have been a cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">with regard to science and science and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">but whether if you if you care about</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">education if you care about</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">how to teach people how to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">and how to educate people across a wild</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">wide swath</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">then i can&#39;t imagine a better place to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">have been yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">i agree i mean it isn&#39;t that place now</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">at all but</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">um but the other thing is you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">eric and i have some stuff we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">work out i guess but we did a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">amount of good for lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">deserved it and what&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.519" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">it would have been right what brexit was</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">and during that time he mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">of the strange events that had begun to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">happen on campus the previous year which</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">was the first year of george bridge&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">tenure</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">and he said i just i just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">what is wrong with these people</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">you know this is this is insane we live</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">in such a bubble</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">of you know delightful relations between</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">all people</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">and i cannot actually fathom what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">and so when he died and some part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">activist faculty tried to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">his death as a banner for their for</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">act of activism it was awful</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">and um yeah they co-opted</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">they co-opted it and so i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">this i&#39;m just looking back at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">um the untimely passing of cabbie seemed</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">related to the disproportion and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">consolable emotional energy directed at</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">brett</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">i think i think the fact that you dared</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">speak of him</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">yeah with fondness and dared say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">you know you and he had been friendly</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">and i whatever you said it was maybe two</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">lines long it wasn&#39;t a soliloquy it</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">you weren&#39;t claiming deep you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">knowledge of the man just that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">he was a good man and what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">say there but which was true which maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">people could read the subtext was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t have tolerated what was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">going on no he wouldn&#39;t and if he hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">been sick i think he would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">been a voice of reason yeah so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">know that you and i have ever talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">about this actually but</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">um after the there was a moment at which</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">i became public enemy number one</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">and benjamin voice has now covered it</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the faculty meeting</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">in which i took my colleagues to task</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">for their very</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">first uh official move which was</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">to get our union to negotiate into our</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">contract</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">a requirement that we investigate our</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">which would then be fodder for hiring</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">firing</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">promotion all of these things this would</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">have been at the end of the 2016 year</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">right the the rather the 2015-2016 or so</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how far it would go but i</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">knew that i was going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">be public enemy number one and um</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">i said my piece and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:07.920" style="s2">after the meeting i went over to one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">the people on the other side&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.920" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">side of the argument and i attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">reason with her</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">and cabbie made a point of coming up to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.600" end="00:16:18.959" style="s2">all right so this is a meeting in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">i&#39;ve alerted</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.959" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">the intersectionals that i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">to put up with their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">and cabbie comes over to me unconcerned</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">and he starts talking to me about</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">his confusion at what was unfolding on</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">the campus and the thing he pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">actually was what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">flyer gate which was the initial</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">public foray into</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">this madness in which naima lowe</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">had portrayed herself as at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">you know the height of exhaustion from</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">having consoled</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">students who were holding i think vigils</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">it was like a black wellness rally but</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">it involved some black power symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">and it claimed to fight white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">and i actually remember seeing the flyer</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">on the campus</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">and thinking white supremacy what are</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">they even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">um but anyway this flyer had been</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">apparently torn down</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">by some people now i don&#39;t think we ever</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">got to the bottom of it we don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">it was torn down by people who said</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">white supremacy what are they talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">about and tore it down or</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">they were placed some places that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed to be flyers and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">janitors took them down which happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:34.160" style="s2">all the time right right or the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">was fictional or the story was fictional</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.160" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">right and actually i must tell you there</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">so naima showed the flyer a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">herself holding the flyer broadcast it</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">on email</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">and the most insane stuff erupted right</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">suddenly the campus was falling all over</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">her bravery her courage her courage and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">to declare endless</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">work on behalf of all of us right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">even worse was</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">the um the escalating</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">language surrounding the uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">atrocity i believe actually even came up</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">of tearing these flyers down and there</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">was i</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">kid you not i am not exaggerating and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">am not making this up</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">but before this thing was over all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">administrators</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">were posting this flyer for an event i</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">think that had already passed at this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">point maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">they were posting it on their doors and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">children&#39;s center this uh daycare center</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">which had been amazing both our kids had</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">gone was printing out the flyers</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">um and uh anyway it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">it was incredible so anyway after this</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">meeting where i had gotten up and spoken</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">cabbie comes over to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">and he says i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">around here and he said you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">i started looking at this email thread</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">about the flyers i couldn&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">what was going on i thought somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">must have been shot</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">those are his exact words i thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">somebody must have been shot</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">and it really you know it may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">that there was some emotional outpouring</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">that came from the loss of cabbie that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">got directed at me but</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">that is not how cabbie would have wanted</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">it yeah right this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">was not who he was he was he was a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">man an honest man</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">and he held no truck with this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">intersectional bullshit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">so anyway um uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">it it&#39;s very sad that he was lost and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">must say</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">we felt it personally even so i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">know him all that well i guess you knew</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">him a little better but</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">um but it&#39;s terrible to take somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">uh memory and the grief over their loss</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">and co-opt it to your</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">own purposes which you know at best</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened here</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">uh i&#39;m gonna come back to this one which</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">is sort of tangentially related to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">evergreen if we have time</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m still scrolling through here</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.760" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">as in evergreen grad in 1992 and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">student of pete sinclair and mark</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">lewinsky it saddens me that these events</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to be handled by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">evergreen community itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">what do you think the future of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">evergreen will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">condolences for your um</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">your institution and what was our</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">institution yeah i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">unfortunately evergreen had</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:30.400" style="s2">opportunities to change course and even</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">after the riots had unfolded i believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">if they had fired george and they had</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">basically alerted the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">that they understood that they had took</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">taking a wrong turn</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">that they could have recovered and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">so thoroughly refused to do that and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">this day</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">refused to do that and you know the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">move they seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">is to double down and insist that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">were right all along and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">at some level the evergreen you knew and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">the evergreen we knew</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:01.679" style="s2">it&#39;s gone and uh i</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">i won&#39;t be sorry to see it fail at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.679" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">point um</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">at some level it&#39;s just uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">dragging out the misery yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:10.320" style="s2">shell it&#39;s beyond a shell of its former</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.320" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s it saddens us so much</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">that evergreen couldn&#39;t fix this in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">inside of itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">and brett was trying harder than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">and i was trying a handful of other</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">people were trying</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">was running and then we were running</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">on their front page and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">they were they loved what we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">um because it&#39;s shown the right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">light on evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">and we said look one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">one of the things that has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">the last at that point three months</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">since evergreen blew up is that we now</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">know so many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">in both the civil rights movement and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">the free speech movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">and we could bring them together we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">could we could</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">likely make a conference at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">happen that combines these two ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">and we could bring people together like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">bob woodson and jonathan height</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">and greg lukianov and you know so many</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">other people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">actually have a real conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">not always in agreement at all about</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">what the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">of free speech and civil rights on</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">campuses should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">and wouldn&#39;t that be amazing and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">no thanks we&#39;re pretty pleased with how</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">things are going</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">yeah this was in september of 2017</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.919" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">right before classes were due to start</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.840" style="s2">up again no thank you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty pleased with how things are</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">no so i will say you know that moment in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">the hallway</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">which i obviously was not expecting or i</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">would have dressed better</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">you know i said history could pivot in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">the direction of the values you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">standing</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.679" style="s2">here for if only we could hear each</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">other or words to that effect</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.679" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">and this is kind of what i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">about now at that time nobody&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">heard of me we certainly couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">staged</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">such a conference but at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">they thumbed their nose at us</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">in negotiations we certainly could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">imagine for a second that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">had happened with the evergreen story</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">was the madness had broken out the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">had seen it</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">people had realized this is not</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">and then we could have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">about well what grievances do make sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">what remedies didn&#39;t work and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">remedies might work and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:45.840" style="s2">you know what does another model look</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">like and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.840" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">um you know i mean you saw it you saw it</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">those images of our class learning about</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">all the features of biology culture</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">together that&#39;s kind of what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">like when it works so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">place to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">but unfortunately this simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">derailed the entire conversation and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">um allowed it to happen were either too</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">foolish or too cowardly to change course</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">which tells you how we got to where we</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">are that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">um thanks for this guys how painful it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">must have been to have the students and</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">careers you loved ripped from you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">my question is where is the redemption</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">the podcast is lovely but it&#39;s light</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">fair</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">what will you teach what will you really</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">teach the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a lovely question yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">good question</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">um i mean there&#39;s one part of it that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">take some exception to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">the podcast is light fair it can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">in the sense that any individual podcast</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">can only be so deep and people are only</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">paying attention at</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">such and such a level but we believe in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">that we call collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">and collective consciousness we know</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">from the classroom is something that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">built over time so concepts get</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">introduced they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">they&#39;re clumsy at first you get better</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">at understanding how they work</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">and then sooner or later you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">toolkit of things that are is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">capable of doing something new</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">and so the podcast is one</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">facet of an attempt to generate</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">conversations that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">capable of fixing problems that just</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">simply stalemate us</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">in their present form so anyway yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">podcast is not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">end of anything but we are interested</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">in i wouldn&#39;t say teaching the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think we know</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">but we&#39;re interested in discovering how</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">is that we might function better</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">right and actually if i can say one more</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">there is um there has long been</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">this uh voice that says</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">your progressives you brought this on</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">yourselves um and then it turned on you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">then that&#39;s the point at which you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">woke up or something and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">been nonsense but it does</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">point to a confusion that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">how is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">are progressives and yet we claim no</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">ownership of that madness</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:17.919" style="s2">well we are progressives by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">the fact that we believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.919" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">progress is necessary in my case i will</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">say i believe that if we do not make</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">a an extreme kind of progress that our</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">tenure here on the planet is about to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">come to an end so this is a requirement</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">progress is necessary it doesn&#39;t mean i</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">in progress that&#39;s been spelled out by</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">others i&#39;m not signing up for</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">any program of progress that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">formulated that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">accept much less all programs for</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">progress which i guess if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">have this idea of what progressivism is</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">then you just embrace all progress</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">no most progress is not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to have bad consequences</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">there are things we could do that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">make us much better off we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">know what most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m interested we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">exploration and so that&#39;s what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">progressives and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">any of the garbage proposals because</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.400" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">we never signed on for them we never</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">said we were for them</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">those things are their own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">delusion</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re interested in going you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">threading the needle and getting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t a delusion but does</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">make us better and more important</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">uh more importantly safer</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">to add to that the question what will</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">you really teach the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">you know the book that we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">uh which is a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">and each chapter could be and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">many of them we each one of us</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">individually will</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">ultimately turn into books of their own</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">uh is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">effectively a kind of redemption book</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">uh and that wasn&#39;t how the publisher who</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">approached us to see if we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">interested in writing it or</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:59.360" style="s2">um the agent who approached you first</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">after everything was blowing up to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.360" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">if you had anything that you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">write</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">was thinking of it but i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">that it effectively it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">brings together so many of the threads</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">of evolutionary thinking</p>

<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">with learning communities that were</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">themselves evolving as well</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">point how is it that we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">make</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">hundreds of years in the future this</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">that book is will be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">redemption</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">and from there then i think each of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">will start moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">um you know into our our own projects</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">often directly follow from the work in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">that book</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:25.679" style="s2">and uh i assume most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">listening to the q a will have listen to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.679" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">the first hour of the podcast but um</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">the students who dropped in on our</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">classes who kept coming back even after</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">they had graduated in some cases just to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">participate in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">the book is a continuation of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">so if you&#39;re interested in getting in on</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">what it was that brought them back</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">this is the way in yeah and yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">should be noted</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.799" style="s2">that our research assistant on the book</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">uh is in fact one of one of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.799" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">he is he was one of our students fairly</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">early on in our time there and became a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">and um has worked with us in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">on physical projects and now on</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">intellectual projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve worked with him from evolution to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">um and he you know he&#39;s somebody who was</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">like me</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">a very bad fit for school or school was</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">a very bad fit for us and he&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">who i mean by his own telling um</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t really feel like he had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">capacity in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">until he landed in our class and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">took off so anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">yeah the story sort of is ongoing even</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">if the uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">the locale has changed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">do this one i think is evergreen related</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.440" end="00:30:49.840" style="s2">ish so i&#39;ll go with it due to cobia 19</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">due to covet 19 brought changes in</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.840" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">college ed</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">it being not in person etc could now be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">a good time to separate the two goals of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">higher ed</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">research and teaching would that make</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">things better this is this is a tough</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">one so</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">the question is basically about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">as the question writer uh points out</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">that there really are two things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">higher ed is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">and research and teaching are not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">people who are good at one are often not</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">good at the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">research is privileged and if you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">only good at teaching and not at</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to get a job anywhere um</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">you know with with tenure or especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">anywhere elite</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">and um because many researchers</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">are either not good at educating to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">or because the priorities uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">do not line up to encourage them to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">become good at educating</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">they end up dismissing it as something</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">that only people who can&#39;t do research</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">do and so you get the sort of separation</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">of classes</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">and um mostly researchers people who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">primarily researchers with</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">hard money academic positions have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">teach some but that&#39;s how they feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">about it i have to teach as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">oh and i get to teach these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">so given all that it might seem like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">okay let&#39;s just separate them</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">and honor the researchers for what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">do and honor the teachers for what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">but our experience was certainly that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">our understanding was honed and refined</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">and driven</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">by knowing that we had to be in front of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">students and by the conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">students in the classroom in the field</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">around campfires otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">and that my my sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">is that teaching will become</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.279" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">even less good if it has no direct</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">interface with research</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">and researchers will become even more</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">arrogant and less tuned into the real</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">world if they have less interface with</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">teachers and let me just</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">before you go say one more thing an</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">anecdote that when we were looking to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">to grad school</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">our undergraduate advisor bob trivers</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">extraordinary evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">gave</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">us the following advice he said go</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">someplace well</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:32:59.919" style="s2">two pieces of advice really oh no this</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">is two different things</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.919" end="00:33:03.600" style="s2">um he gave us advice to go someplace to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">the museum</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.600" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">first of all but then he also said when</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">you end up deciding</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.960" style="s2">where to go after you graduate go</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">someplace where you have regular</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.960" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">interactions with undergraduates</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">why said because undergraduates don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">know what they&#39;re doing yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">and they will ask questions that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">people in the field who know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:24.399" style="s2">they&#39;re doing wouldn&#39;t dare to ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">and therefore if you only talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.399" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">people who are already in your field</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">you are likely to get stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">intellectual dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">whereas if you really engage with</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">undergraduates as he had done with us</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">you know he had taken us under his wing</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">and we were effect we were like graduate</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:38.960" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">working very closely with him for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.960" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">couple of years at uc santa cruz</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">um we we both threw lots of stuff at him</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">he hadn&#39;t thought in those in those ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">and we didn&#39;t know that we were being</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">you know disrespectful to the field</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t know the field yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">so you know that advice has struck me as</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">very wise and is a counterpoint to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">idea that research and teaching could be</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">profitably separated</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">yeah um i take all that to be accurate i</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">think both research and teaching are</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">yes so it&#39;s a little hard to know um</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:13.599" style="s2">what the net effect would be of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">separating them</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.599" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">i do think there&#39;s something as much of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">the work</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">that flies under the banner research</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">becomes more technological and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">more specialized</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.440" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">the relevance to what it is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">to teach</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">undergraduates is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">dropping and so i do think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">something absurd</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">about somebody who has you know gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">degree by studying some very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">question and then suddenly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">teaching bio 101 and it&#39;s like well what</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">do they even know about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">right you know yeah what they know about</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">it is what they learned in bio 101</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">you know many years before and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">received wisdom from the textbook that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">they&#39;ve been encouraged to use by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">publishers which is its own cabal</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">yeah so it turns to to garbage really i</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">the problem is if you start tugging at</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">the sweater you find the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">is going to unravel and really we need a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">new model that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">a lot more enlightened about what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">trying to accomplish and even knows what</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to accomplish so it then can</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">figure out whether it&#39;s succeeding</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">rather than a model</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">who defaults to kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">self-preservation mode where</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">it is its own defense um so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">not clear to me i did have one other</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">thought though</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">there i think there&#39;s an argument to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">separate research from teaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">although not so much theoretical work</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">theoretical work is a good companion for</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">teaching whereas</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">lab work might not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s a place where i see</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">something else that goes the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">which is medicine and i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">fact that doctors do not autopsy their</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">patients</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">in general am i correct about that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">assume so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">yeah i think medical examiners are a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">different different crew</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">right so anyway yeah the uh the thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">and if i&#39;m wrong about this if doctors</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">do do their own autopsies then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">will surely alert me and i will deliver</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">an apology but</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">um to the extent that they don&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">problem is this breaks an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">test hypotheses when a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">imagines something is going on inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">the body of a patient</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">and they act accordingly and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">patient dies the ability to go in and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">see what actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">is going on inside that body means that</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">they will become a better doctor it</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">makes the process</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">educational in a way that if you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">get a report of what was in there</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">it would be you know i&#39;m not a doctor so</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know for sure but my guess as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">biologist would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">it would be a dim shadow of what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">would learn actually seeing which</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">tissues were inflamed and in what way</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">which would give you better intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">which might result in breakthroughs that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">we won&#39;t otherwise get</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">yeah good next question</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">how do you imagine evergreen would look</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">today if you had not resisted the mom</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">what attention did the mob pay to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">admissions process and policies for</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">example if a group of prospective white</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">students visited campus</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">you guys rock thanks so</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">don&#39;t totally follow the end of it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">um what would have happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">and you know what there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">points that you could have stopped</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">you know you you could have just stopped</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">sending emails at some point yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">um but imagine that it gets to may 23</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">2017</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">and they show up i don&#39;t even know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">you know many many people have said how</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">did you do that how did you stay so calm</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">and cool</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">and reasonable in the face of a mob and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">that is a question that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">i would love to to hear you answer but</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ve heard you answer but i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:44.079" style="s2">love to hear you answer here</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">uh but also there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t have just laid down and let</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">be like what would what would any other</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">response look like especially given that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">all of your students were there</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">backing you up yeah actually i spent a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">lot of time thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">um on the one hand yes it&#39;s very nice to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">have people say</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">i&#39;m so glad you did that and you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">do the other thing and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.720" style="s2">would the other thing even it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.720" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">right a you have to sleep you do have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">you know had i caved in the face of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">nonsense which i knew was nonsense it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">would have been a betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">certainly of all the students who were</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">standing there and then all of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.480" end="00:38:24.800" style="s2">students who were oh you mean all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:28.240" style="s2">your students</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">my students yeah well also the students</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.240" end="00:38:31.920" style="s2">i it&#39;s not what i meant to say but also</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">the students who were there confronting</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.920" end="00:38:36.119" style="s2">me some of whom</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">were perfectly reachable and were</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.119" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">enthralled to some crazy idea as many of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">us have been enthralled with some crazy</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">idea at some point so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">i owed it to them to try to compel them</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:48.640" style="s2">that there was a better way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.640" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">and that it wasn&#39;t impossible to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">there and in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">know that i made some progress on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">couple of those fronts and that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">problem was i was up against something</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">that when i made progress it would go</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">unravel that progress</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">right afterwards and so that was an</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">unwinnable</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">puzzle at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.000" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">uh i i&#39;m there a lot of things i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">good at</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">i do feel like i was kind of born for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">i think you weren&#39;t knowing what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">were in that sort of situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">that&#39;s not difficult and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s weird as it unfolds you know you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">the conscious mind sort of becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">spectator and it watches the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">happen and it hears you say</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">what you say just as everyone else hears</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">it um but</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">that&#39;s because it&#39;s done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">preparing and yeah this is this is true</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">this is something that you do i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">really are you really are</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">best at the world in several things</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">and what what people when people see you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">do extraordinary things like</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">what you did that day and over the next</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">several days and even weeks</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">but especially initially that day in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">hallway</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">um people see that and i remember often</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">our students especially our male</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">students would see you and be like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what i am</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">like i can i can be like that and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">thought that what they were seeing was</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">all of it but</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">the fact is that you spend so much of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">your time</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">when you&#39;re not on as it were working</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">through alternative scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">figuring out and you know both in terms</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">of action but in terms of idea space</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">especially like this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">makes you the theoretician that you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">right that that you go through and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">well if you know if this prediction</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">holds what else what else what else what</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">else oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">okay now okay i&#39;m gonna go back back</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">back i&#39;m gonna go through this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">and you do this over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">again and you redo them too you iterate</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.599" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">one of our students actually who i just</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">heard from who really</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">actually did think that something was</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">coming down the pike like this frankie</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">um but uh i didn&#39;t you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">the idea of a confrontation in real time</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">in a hallway never</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">occurred to me and i don&#39;t think to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">i think i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">um but still you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">prepared in so many ways over the year</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">when it be when when the anger that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">coming back at you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">was increasingly vitriolic and filled</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">with bile and insane and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">people were jumping on the bandwagon</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">in some ways you got calmer and calmer</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">and more and more resolved</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">not more certain you question yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">and your conclusions and the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">of others</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">all the time and that that is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">that you were there they could not call</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">your intentions into question in either</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">your head</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:47.680" style="s2">or the heads of any of your students</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">because these are students who you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">been with this was like week seven i</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">think of the quarter</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">it was only a one-quarter program but</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:54.000" style="s2">you had known some of these students for</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.000" end="00:41:57.839" style="s2">some of the students at the lisa you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">known these students for seven weeks</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:01.280" style="s2">and not a single one of those students</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">thought oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">maybe those protesters are right about</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:07.280" style="s2">brett no not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">single one they couldn&#39;t possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.280" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">been misled into that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s because every single day in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">classroom and in life you demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">this just this constant</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">reassessment of what if i was wrong what</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">if i was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">okay if i am right what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">okay what if i&#39;m wrong about this thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it all the time and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">just can&#39;t ever stop this is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">science is supposed to look like this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">what good life is supposed to look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">and this is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">to a degree that i&#39;ve actually never</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">seen anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">do wow um</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot a lot in there and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very gratifying</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">to hear it described that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">i will say that the a as i said to mike</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">nena</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">when i interviewed him early on in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.319" style="s2">there was something i learned from his</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">film even though i had seen all of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.319" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">clips</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">and i&#39;d seen all the interviews but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">way he juxtaposed things revealed</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">something to me about what the students</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">thought they were accomplishing on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">they were expected to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:11.839" style="s2">they were expecting my students to jump</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">ship</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.839" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">because this accusation of racism is so</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">that you know people people naturally</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">you know figure out which way the wind</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:36.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:39.119" style="s2">it never occurred to me that that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.960" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">going to happen because for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.119" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">not only you know these were my students</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">and in many cases are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">students and you know i knew them all</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">but i had been processing this with them</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">even though that was not the explicit</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">topic so</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">uh somebody mentioned recently that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">had a diagram on the board</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">i think the day before the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">of the um basically a hypothesis that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">was advancing for the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">witch hunts function now why were witch</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine but um but they were on</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.119" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">my mind and so i was processing with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">students and in fact at one point</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">i remember it might have been in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">week prior</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">i came into class and i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">you know i typically rode straight from</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">up against the wall and just started</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">teaching you know hence the way i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">dressed in the hallway but</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">because you always arrived with like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">negative 30 seconds to spare</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">no it was about 30 seconds it was 13</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">but anyway um i arrived and i had just</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">one of those emails and in that email he</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">had alleged</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">that there was a calculation that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">could be doing about</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">how much uh the value</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">that we would assign to the damage that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">i was doing students</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">every hour of my teaching by teaching</p>

<p begin="00:45:24.640" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">become familiar with over email but like</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">couldn&#39;t recognize in a lineup like</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have any idea what the guy is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.119" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">yeah yeah um but anyway i came into</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">class having just read that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:39.119" style="s2">and some some of my students</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">noted that something was you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.119" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">running behind my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">and they were like what&#39;s up and i was</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">explained the premise of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">and so this is the this is like angry</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">this is the day of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">no no i think it was in the couple days</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">prior i can&#39;t place it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">for sure we could figure it out but</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">anyway my students i did not actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">predict i thought they would see the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">humor in it the way i did</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">but they were angry because somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">basically accusing</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">them of whatever the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">learning is of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">you know having ignorance they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:22.720" style="s2">right something or they&#39;re too dumb to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">recognize that the person in front of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.720" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">the room is making them stupider or</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what but anyway they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">angry about this and you know as</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">soon as i saw their anger it made a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">of sense to me i didn&#39;t didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">predict it but um nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">um that was the context</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">of the hallway and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">never occurred to me that they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">gonna they were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">reject that or even not live up to the</p>

<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">courageous in the face of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.560" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">anyway i was heartened to see that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">on that front unfolded exactly as i</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">would have expected and not at all as</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">expected um that&#39;s as it should have</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">think that what they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.880" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">is that they are going to shift blame</p>

<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">very different environment so when i</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:12.079" style="s2">sound like fun to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">yeah so i mean the questioner does say</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">the if the right opportunity arose and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">wiggle room in that and you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">working um</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">for a year or so on trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">what uh a possible alternative to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">current higher ed system might look like</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">and you know may may end up back on</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">on that project at some point um</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">as brett said not in any current</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">but are there are there</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">possible ways you know might we for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">start running workshops um for</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">people you know college student age and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">otherwise uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">in evolutionary thinking we&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">about that in fact we were making some</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">on on thinking through that before covet</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">19 hit and um</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s totally stalled at the moment um</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">yeah that maybe that&#39;s yeah i would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">if you take the right opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">broadly then sure the right opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:11.839" style="s2">sounds delightful but it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">lot of uh detail</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.839" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">associated with it but there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">of wrong opportunities that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">that appealing</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">yeah mostly i&#39;m not reading the names</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">but duck mcmuffin</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">asks if you could turn back time do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">think you could prevent the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">if yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">how god you just did everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">and you were being maligned for</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">everything that you did do and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">started out gentle</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">so gentle and then you got less gentle</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re always respectful</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">and you know what what else could have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">been done</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:42.400" style="s2">what else could have been done i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">guess if we could turn back time a long</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.400" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">ways and not hire george bridges in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">first place you know we knew people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">were on the hiring committee</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">i know one of them very very well and he</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:55.040" style="s2">was not sure about this guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">but the chair of the committee basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">the college got</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">got consultants to come in they</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">basically they basically outsourced a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">lot of the work</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">to educational consultants and who knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">what their incentives are</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">and together with the chair not being</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">fully present we ended up with george</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">bridges</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">and i think at the point the bridges</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">shows up</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s true like we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">gone you know his his first year there</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">included the 11 weeks that we were in</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">ecuador so we we</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">were gone for a lot of his laying of his</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">plans but</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">what else could you have done okay so</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">you read that question yes and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">understood it incorrectly i thought if</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:40.240" style="s2">you could turn back time</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">could you prevent the covet 19 pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">maybe and then it turned out it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">about evergreen oh no there&#39;s nothing i</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.400" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">could have done there</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">well you know duck mcmuffin here is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">ambiguous he says the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">the catastrophe so covet 19 maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">probably not but maybe but evergreen no</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">that that was too there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">momentum in that system</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">all headed in the wrong direction uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">post evergreen what helped you most to</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">deal with the loss you must have felt</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to be honest about this one</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">loss there was loss but it was not</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">net loss and that changes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">so there was something very traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">about a having</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">colleagues and in some cases friends</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">turn on us</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">there was something very uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">reassuring about seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">who we barely knew in some cases rise to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">the occasion</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">the consequence of being so publicly</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">um threatened in our workplace</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">resulted in all kinds of things becoming</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:02.000" style="s2">possible in our lives that just</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">weren&#39;t before and so you know is there</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.000" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">loss yes very definitely if we limit it</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">to what we had at evergreen in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">teaching environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:12.400" style="s2">we lost that but we gained a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">amount in this process also and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">other thing is i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">we were living on borrowed time for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">or possibly two this was bubbling up it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">was gonna come for us sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">and we got out intact after a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">very dangerous years</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">and um so in some sense there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">you know relief we made it to the beach</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">loss it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a simple feeling</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">of loss for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">yeah i i think i agree with all of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">i think i</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">felt to some degree still do feel but</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">certainly felt uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">especially after the just the horror of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">mediation and the way the college</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">treated us</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">just horrifying i felt that acutely i</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">felt the loss</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">and i felt it as a kind of disloyalty</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">had not imagined possible and it was one</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">of many moments when i really wished my</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">dad had been alive</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">um to talk to about you know he he came</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">if he was born in 1938 and he came of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">age when</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">um you gave your heart and soul to an</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">organization that you thought was</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">valuable and it treated you right in</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">and he had almost always not always but</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">almost always found that to be true</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">in his in his work with even these big</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">corporations you know xerox and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:38.400" style="s2">honeywell and such</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.400" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">i i had come to recognize many years</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">um that loyalty was really one of my my</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">highest values</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">that um once once i have really done</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">my assessment and figured out whether or</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">not someone or something is worthy of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">loyalty i am loyal</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">and uh evergreen had</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">had appeared to be responding in kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">by you know advertising my and our work</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">could take to the bank</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">literally um but uh through</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">recognition from all the people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">seemed to matter on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">um that this was actually that we were</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">really doing what what the founding</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">faculty had intended to be done</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">and having people like steve herman</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">the the really grotesque way that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">treated us</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">in the end uh i still feel and i you</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">most weeks i don&#39;t think about it most</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">months i probably don&#39;t think about it</p>

<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">the farther back it was the more likely</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">those emails were to have gone gone</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">out they wouldn&#39;t have been good anymore</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">um said you know this this is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">and our programs were flawed but they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">they were great and evergreen cannot</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.799" style="s2">take that away</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">and i you know i still feel that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.799" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">what we did there</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">yeah was actually amazing and we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">generations of students who know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">and what the current administration and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">many of the faculty at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:03.359" style="s2">um are now apparently even teaching the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">current students</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">exactly the contrary does not make it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">true yeah the fact that they are lying</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:14.799" style="s2">does not make it true quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.799" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">you&#39;re about an hour about an hour okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go through</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">one or two more here</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">what you could what could have been done</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">to avoid the evergreen situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">escalating as it did or was it an</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">unstoppable runaway canoe that once set</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">in motion can only spin out of control</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:40.480" style="s2">how do we stop this happening where it</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">arises</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">that depends what position you hold</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:46.640" style="s2">somebody who had</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.280" style="s2">the proper position could have prevented</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.640" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.280" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">it was not possible for a tenured</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.160" style="s2">faculty member</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">to derail it i believe</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.160" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">the provost could have which is why</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:02.839" style="s2">george took about</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">firing him right away and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.839" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">uh whatever else may be true of george</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">george played a pretty savvy game</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">from the point of view of reorganizing</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">the administration and the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">that game</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">was to protect george uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">it worked i mean this is why george has</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">left with laudatory reports even though</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">wrecked the place is that he uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">he elevated some people which made them</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">very very loyal</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">he fired some people who were going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:36.799" style="s2">be trouble because they wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">put up with his bullshit anymore than we</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.799" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">um and it was effective</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">so yeah one of his first moves</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">right one of his first moves was to fire</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">uh michael zimmerman who was the provost</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:51.280" style="s2">um because he needed him gone if he was</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">going to do what he was going to do he</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.280" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:56.799" style="s2">bulldoze his way into the nightmare if</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">he didn&#39;t get rid of michael so</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">so how do we stop this happening where</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">it arises you you you got it it depends</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">on it depends on what your position is</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">if you are not administration you need</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">to know the administration will have</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">your back</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">and you know at a higher ed level the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">chicago principles the principles put</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:16.000" style="s2">out by university of chicago</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">a few years back are the right thing but</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.000" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">probably go far enough and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">appear to be binding even those</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">universities that have</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">adopted the chicago principles don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:45.680" style="s2">i had during ecuador i had</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.559" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">tried to capture a photo of every</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.680" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">student that actually got who they were</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">and there were a few students who were</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">very very difficult to capture and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">a couple i&#39;m not even sure i got there</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">but i spent a lot of time on the project</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">and we had thousands of other photos</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">from places we had been and things we</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">had done and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:07.839" style="s2">and we had offered to put together</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">a gallery exhibit that was i put</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.839" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">there was so much to this sorry but like</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">i had this whole formal proposal and i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">met with the gallery</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">person and she loved it and it was it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">was beautiful because we had done</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">what it is that evergreen had tried from</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">the beginning to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">so you had assignments that these</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">students had written reflections that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:29.040" style="s2">were really deep these weren&#39;t things</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">people just turned in because</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.040" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">you know they were going to be read by</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.880" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">you and they put their heart and soul</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">we had the photos we had this</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">extraordinary trip it&#39;s itinerary that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.640" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">went all over</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">yeah went all over and it was going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">be a great show</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.400" style="s2">and it was going to highlight what could</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:48.559" style="s2">be done at evergreen it was exactly</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.400" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">about the richness of what was possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.559" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">at evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">and it could have even i mean it could</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:53.680" style="s2">have even gone to other liberal arts</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">colleges</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.680" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">um to to highlight what was possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">because there you know there are always</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:01.039" style="s2">people who are saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">at other schools what what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.039" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">at evergreen is amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">how can we do that here yeah right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">anyway my point is at the point of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">administration</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">and in fact certain people who uh were</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">gunning for us</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">already decided no no we can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">even after i&#39;d gotten an informal yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:20.880" style="s2">enthusiastic yes from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">gallery director right and you know in</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.880" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">this gallery well i won&#39;t go into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">the fight over whether or not the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">gallery should continue but</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">this would have been an excellent use of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.599" style="s2">the gallery and it would have brought</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.200" style="s2">a lot of people into it and it would</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.599" end="01:02:35.119" style="s2">have allowed people to see what was</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.200" end="01:02:37.039" style="s2">possible at evergreen which frankly</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.119" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">many faculty come in and with this weird</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">model nobody ever tells them what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">possible and they default into the first</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">thing they see and they never get over</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">this would have been valuable the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:52.880" style="s2">fact of it being</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">effectively erased from the history by</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.880" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">blocking it at the level that we would</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">have displayed it</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.160" style="s2">that was a move and that was a move that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">made what happened</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.160" end="01:03:04.799" style="s2">possible because frankly i mean you all</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">watched the podcast have seen some of</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.799" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">the photos the photos put the lie to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">that this you know that we were some</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:13.599" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">you know backwards racists who were</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.599" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">teaching this stuff in our classroom so</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:17.119" style="s2">it would have been inconsistent with it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:18.880" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.119" end="01:03:20.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the people who shut down</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.880" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">the idea of the gallery show</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.400" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">knew what they were doing but there was</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">an instinctive thing which is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:27.760" style="s2">that shines a light on what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">what we we were doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.760" end="01:03:33.599" style="s2">is bad for whatever they were up to and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">um there was a lot of that so in some</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.599" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">displaying the possible makes it</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:41.200" style="s2">impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">tell fairy tales that are incompatible</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.200" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">with reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">and that would have been would have been</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.160" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:49.839" style="s2">one more question and then we&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:51.680" style="s2">okay you guys had me crying with that</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:54.400" style="s2">letter from the student</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.680" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">me too yeah i was almost there thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.400" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">on whether things like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">were are or will be a main catalyst for</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">stopping the spread of this bigotry</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">um i i hope so</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.799" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">i really</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:14.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s very difficult to convey</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">the level</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.480" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">of tragedy i mean at one level</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">all the people that we knew i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:24.839" style="s2">every student we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">knew is now gone from evergreen is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.839" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:29.760" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right at this point yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:32.799" style="s2">as of as of this last graduation</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">right so at the level of no the yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.799" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">last one</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">along a while ago now yeah um so</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">in some sense we don&#39;t even know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">population of students anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">you know we are now gone but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.720" end="01:04:48.960" style="s2">recognition</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">that the biggest betrayal here as bad as</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.960" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">the betrayal of us</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">was there were an indefinitely large</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">number of students going forward into</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">who needed a college that would treat</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">them very</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:03.039" style="s2">individually because they weren&#39;t built</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">for a college that expected them to just</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.039" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">simply hit the ground and perform</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">those people have now lost that college</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.440" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">because there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">others and those who did it did it for</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:16.960" style="s2">their own reasons</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">most of the students who led these</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.960" end="01:05:21.760" style="s2">protests they&#39;re gone naima</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">she&#39;s gone so these people have moved on</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:24.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:25.680" style="s2">they&#39;re doing whatever they they are</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.400" end="01:05:27.520" style="s2">doing with their lives</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.680" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">but the people who really got hurt most</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.520" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">were the people who needed this</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">and now it&#39;s not going to be there for</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">them and they&#39;re never even going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:37.119" style="s2">so hopefully if you can recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:40.640" style="s2">somebody like</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">odette you know is a measure of</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:45.839" style="s2">what&#39;s possible in such a system you</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">know and she didn&#39;t need the place but</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.839" end="01:05:49.440" style="s2">she certainly benefited from it and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:51.440" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.440" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">uh imagine what it would be like to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.440" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">confronted</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">by people who uh yeah i mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">they talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">black bodies right and i know where that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.559" style="s2">phrase comes from and i actually think</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">that there&#39;s a meaning to it that is</p>
