<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">for having hosted this session these</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">sessions i</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">um today i don&#39;t have a powerpoint</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">presentation actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to try to just speak</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">speak live and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">i&#39;ll also try to be a little bit shorter</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">so particularly a topic like faith and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">and particularly co-created faith and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">religion and co-creating new rituals</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">more sense to to approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">yet more dialogically so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:27.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve covered thus far aesthetics we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">covered and the arts</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.599" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">um as uh and we have argued that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">are generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">within each of these meta memes</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">that you you can and that each generator</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">function creates a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">a greater variability</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">of different um of different artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">cultural expressions um that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">post-modern society for instance with</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">that with a post-modern generator</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">function at its core</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">will create different</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">uh more different kinds of artistry</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">than a uh than a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:14.000" style="s2">pre-modern post what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">postposting society</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.000" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">so uh you can you can take a look around</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">medieval europe and its art</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">and its religious art and the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">the painting paintings around around</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">europe and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">for for several hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a resemblance between them</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">whereas in the post-modern days or with</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">with the advent of contemporary art</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">you can look at one particular you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">look at one particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">artist so they and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">you can see that this particular artist</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">is a picasso or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">is pollock or or whatever your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">example might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">that they have that the the number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">fingerprints the number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">capabilities of what can what can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">the depth of what can be created</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">increases</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">as society take makes these leaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">in complexity and we also argued i also</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">argued that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">um meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">metameme this this generator function at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">this developmental stage</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">creates um an incredibly high</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">creativity so that art kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:37.759" style="s2">breaks out of its box it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">confined</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.759" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">to the art um summoners or</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">the the the concept of art and so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">and that it breaks out of its confines</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">and follows</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">follows deep structures in in reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">and mysterious structures of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">science and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">in the labs uh in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">in new religious practices and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">and becomes kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">a driving force or a center of society</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">at large</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">a war of culture at large so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">modernity encapsulated art</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">put it in um in a particular category</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">together with religion together with</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">science these were different categories</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that was an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">powerful differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">that happened postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">critique of that stem particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">early on from the art scene um and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">and from people with with strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">intuitions of what was to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">so it started breaking out of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">categories and started playing with them</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">and started making fun of them poking</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">scores about them um</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">now metamodernism is when it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">breaks out of that cage takes over</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">life and life itself is subdued</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:19.759" style="s2">to an artful or no not an artful</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">and artsy playful</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.759" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">playfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">which at the same time accounts</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:29.680" style="s2">for a deep seriousness because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">stakes are higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">so so we&#39;re in this kind of double bind</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">with it with the new metamodern god i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">approaching the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">the um core topic of today bit by bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">that on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">um we&#39;re crashing the planet we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">a global civilization that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:58.639" style="s2">is likely to uh not</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">work if it doesn&#39;t shift gears and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">uh shift its trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">seriously we also have decaying</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">institutions but it&#39;s not only that on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">very fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">we see that all societies have broken</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">um or basically all societies are broken</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">down sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">ours is a fast-moving extra big</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">society and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">we notice that</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">increases meaning that</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">we also looked at</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">i define particularly from</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">going back to the hansi books and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">expanding a little bit on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">i defined it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">um in terms of the highest</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">subjective states and particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">deeper layers</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">of phenomenological existence that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">deeper into yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">you notice that you you get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">with something more fundamental which</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">was nevertheless ever present</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">we particularly spoke about four such</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">layers which are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">uh present in integral theory and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">and really all over the place and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">spiritual circles</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">the gross body the subtle body the</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">and i also underscored that these that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">these four bodies</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be viewed as such it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">they should be views as layers of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">phenological</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">existence so that more fundamentally we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">tend to notice</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">that um the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">that there is a background to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">we&#39;re feeling and we cannot identify</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">with that background</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a background to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a background to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">and at the very end there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">existence there&#39;s just being</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">and there&#39;s just emergence this big deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">sea of being</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">so deep uh people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">with spiritual depth tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">traversed</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">farther consciously traverse farther</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">back in these</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">phenological layers and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">where you can pick up a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">a lot of artistic intuitions so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">a connection</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">between the arts and their way of being</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">with spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">this spirituality is also connected to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">one of the main topics of our day and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">age which is gender</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">and sexuality and family formation which</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">needs to be reconstituted</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s also one of the categories</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">the household or the family or the core</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">the nuclear family which was also in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">many ways um</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:22.000" style="s2">constituted as a particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">zone or differentiated zone</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.000" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">under modernity so you have professional</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">political and um</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">and personal aspects of life</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.760" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">uh spheres of life which work part</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">uh much more independently than before</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">you can also add a fourth one which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">the one we&#39;re talking about today</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">the religious or perspectival if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">want a fourth p</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">you can say perspectival instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">so what metamodernity does</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">is not to reinvent each of these on</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">own it doesn&#39;t reinvent the professional</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">the the political the personal</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">and the religious each on their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">it reintegrates all of them so modernity</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">differentiated all these things from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">traditional society in which where they</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">were undifferentiated and which they</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">still are in many parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:30.639" style="s2">um and as such it could be it could uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:32.399" style="s2">it could bracket a lot of the naturally</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">occurring corruption that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.399" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">uh that was just ever present just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">part of life before</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">that your boss would also be your</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">brother-in-law would also</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.639" style="s2">be your cousin who&#39;s also go to the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.639" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">and part of the same guild and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">whereas modernity says hey you can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">this cozy stay-at-home dad while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">doing the weekend then you can go be</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">this tough pro</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">in the market then you can go and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">demonstrate for</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">whatever cause you want on your</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">spare time and you don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">tell your boss about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">and then quite crucially modernity also</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">and sure have your religion have your</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:24.959" style="s2">have your beliefs but they&#39;re up to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">they&#39;re not part</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.959" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">of the of the public realm they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">the private forum</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">so you can be christian if you want but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">please don&#39;t come knocking on my door</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">on a friday evening and tell me about</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">and ask me if i found jesus and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">people who do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">are kind of viewed as like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">breaking the deal</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:49.279" style="s2">and most of them get the door slammed in</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">their faces right</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">the kind of equilibrium we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">from now we&#39;re starting from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">equilibrium of modernity which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">breaking down it&#39;s breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:03.199" style="s2">on all of these fronts modernity did</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">other differentiations</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.199" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">modernity is a big differentiator as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">differentiated religion from art</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:17.880" style="s2">from science from industry</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">from politics all of which were</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.880" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">non-differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">prior to modernity</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of obvious in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">we are looking at a new integration</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">reintegration of these these issues</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">and that the the very and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">these categories as we think of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:47.680" style="s2">are products of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">they all show up like art museums where</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.680" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">artists have their</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">exhibitions it&#39;s a 19th century thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">um and 20th century of course um</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">and and on it goes like even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">religious they weren&#39;t defined</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">as religions christianity buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">so on this was done in</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">in um in um</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">conference uh an interfaith conference</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">in the in the 19th century um so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking at when we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">at religion</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">religio</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">what binds all together um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">getting to kind of the core uh or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">the the faith or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">the glue the deeper glue or principle</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">that um that we need to glue</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">our reality back together after we&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">picked it apart</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">is and is going to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">in the world um so first of all</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">it&#39;s not religion as we normally think</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">of it so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">so we&#39;re not gonna add one more we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">not gonna say like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">okay thank you islam christianity</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">um bahrainism and so on</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">and now here&#39;s a new faith and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">how it works</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">um it&#39;s going to resist</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">the categories of modernity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">resist</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">with its limitations so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">so faith and religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">are coming back in a way in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">they&#39;re coming out of the prison</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">of the private realm</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">to which it has been delegated um</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">for almost 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">so so we&#39;re bringing religion back</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.360" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">at the same time of course we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">bringing any of the particular old</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">religions back</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">uh we can still i mean there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">rich material there</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">where you always pay a price for each</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">new value meme you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">or a rich new meta meme or or each new</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">uh each new stage of development in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">and the terrible price price was paid of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">course um</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">for modernity um namely that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">we lost um we lost all of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:30.640" style="s2">um sincere faith we had other virtues</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">back then you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.640" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">being pious being</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">humble all humility</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">i mean things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">purity things that were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">powerful um psychological attractors</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">and strong practices we kind of lost to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">to get this</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">to get to this new uh to this new stage</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">a modern religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">now you always pay a price right</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">so what we&#39;re paying the price we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">paying for this making this sleep from</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">modernity and its differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">to meta-modernity&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">reintegration of all of these topics</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:26.000" style="s2">is that it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">to integrate and when we try to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.000" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">integrate and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">fail which we inevitably do things</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">become pre not post meaning they become</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">so what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">uh suddenly i&#39;m i&#39;m a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">and for a long while you could be just a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t have to be a theologian</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t have to underpin it with</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">a strong faith</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">now these things are in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">each other again</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">and trying to be integrated so here i am</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">a philosopher a secular political</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">and a social scientist and nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">i am driven by revolutionary faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">and um yes i want to stop and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">that revolutionary faith for a while</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">but but that with this caveat before we</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">the caveat being</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">the more we reintegrate the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">mistakes we can make</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">nevertheless if we don&#39;t reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">we will continue to our differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:45.520" style="s2">of these different spheres will</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">imply the failure of integration of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.520" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">agencies and our psychologists and our</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">behaviors and our social systems and our</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">and we will continue to decay until our</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">civilization falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">when we do try well not just our</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">civilization the the systems around it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">uh when we do try to um</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">reintegrate um</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">we always risk being the bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">we risk being totalitarians because when</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">you integrate and you don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">one part will conquer the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">um so this is also why there is which i</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">keep coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">at this very moment in history a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">pr ever very pressing and present</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">risk of new and totalitarianisms</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">um cropping up uh and and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">necessarily notice or recognize them as</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">such because they tend to be more subtle</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">in their in their in the forms that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">they show up</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">so okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">meta modern religion met a modern faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">we lost faith with modernity we had</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">faith in progress</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">but we didn&#39;t have just faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">just kierkegaardian pure i just</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.919" style="s2">believe just for the heck of it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.919" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">i well you know just because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">something higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">something awesome something cool</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">um and i can be guided by that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">and we have to lose it we had to lose it</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">um we had to lose that kind of innocence</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">now can you reinvent innocence</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">from a nihilistic nietzschean foundation</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do so</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">okay god is dead but other categories</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">okay we killed god that was that was um</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">the old uh pre-modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">category or set of categories you go on</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">from there</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">um moderns believe in humanity</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a construct</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">i haven&#39;t i&#39;ve never seen the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">listen</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">you know no more have i seen the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">will anything particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">um i just see a lot of different people</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">with their which even aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">coherent as he as individual persons</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">so i don&#39;t even so so so we kill off the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">people we kill off the individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">and we have co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">we have co-creation of course well so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a temptation there well so</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">there&#39;s this cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">erotic process of becoming that drive</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">soldiers you can ally with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">oh wait a minute that&#39;s still you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">so you still think you know where this</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">thing is going</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">and and that&#39;s pretty high horses to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">on to think hey i&#39;m allied with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">universe evolving itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">no no post-modernism means</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">nobody knows it means you are making</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">this claim yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">for your own epistemic limited</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">from your own epistemically limited</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">and for your own interests and never</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">deny that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">okay also i don&#39;t even get that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">also so we we&#39;ve killed god kill those</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">other categories well there&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">there&#39;s objective truth beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:48.159" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">truth well but on the other hand whose</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.159" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">and the truth always goes deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">it&#39;s always context dependent</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">um and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s never static so you never</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">reach it there&#39;s only relative truth</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">uh what whenever we speak anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">whenever we describe reality there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">never a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">description so</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">and and it also omits all</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">questions of meaning and so on</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">so just well death</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">yeah and just uh we&#39;re we&#39;re just left</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">in a in a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">dark and fairly dark place which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">such a bad place to start if you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">we&#39;re left in nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">things just kind of happened kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">and if you do look at that though</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">we do see within</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">this nothing there is experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">and there are qualities</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.400" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">such as those within the higher states</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">love joy acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">the sense of enlightenment and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">interestingly enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">when people touch upon</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">these higher states when people touch</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">upon the non-dual states particularly</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">and the causal and non-dual states when</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">they are have spiritual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">interestingly their ontology will share</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s very not always but it&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">rare</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">that people who have these stronger</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">spiritual experiences</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:47.840" style="s2">by psychedelics but uh preferably</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">perhaps via</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">other means such as your own practice or</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">your reality tends to be cut feel less</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">materialist</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">and you tend to identify less with</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">course reality you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">identify more with with the non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">c from which it all appears to emerge so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">there appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">that people have strong spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">experience turn this upside down</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">now that actually connects pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">with what we just said</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">so there appears to be just pure</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">from which things emerge</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">and there appears to be a truth claim to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">that the farther we go</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">into our own experience and the farther</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">we explore</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">the farther reaches of the mind etc</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.400" style="s2">the more we tend to become both</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.400" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">and religious both</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">when we do that so so basically we start</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">hmm i think reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">is good rather than bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">which nevertheless translates to</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">and um like no faith in the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">gonna help me</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">they from where i have now somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">discovers that hey you can microwave</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">something in in microwave and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">make the whole world explode</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">just happen to be a discovery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">waiting</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">around the corner and at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">when it&#39;s discovered people just look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">each other and we know we have three</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">seconds left to live</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s it who knows who knows</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a dark world</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">or if it&#39;s a light world empirically but</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">know that the low states exist</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">that there is an incredible seriousness</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">incredibly high and that it&#39;s no [ __ ]</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">that even hell freezes over</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">because at because whenever</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">we come out of the low states</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">we always find that we came out what</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">appeared to be an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">we appeared to be stuck we appeared to</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:24.000" style="s2">and you understand the truth about</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">something it tends to dissolve into</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">it tends to open up so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">we also know that even though life feels</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">incredibly cruel and it is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">cruel</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">it is in the last instance a cosmic joke</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">and the jokes on us and it&#39;s by us and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">our fundamental awakening to it is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">we laugh along</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">that&#39;s like a good one</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">wow wow yeah i almost killed myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">there for</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">five years but it&#39;s just a joke</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">um at the same time of course not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">joking i mean and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">so so there is a directionality to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">so it appears as though we could have</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">been in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">universe where the more truth we find</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">out about something</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">the worse it gets you know but that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">it it appears as though we misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">things and then we get in all these</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">cluster [ __ ] and then it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">clear when we get the real</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">when i really understand your</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">perspective i realized you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">actually evil and so on</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">um so it appears as</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">though the fabric of the universe itself</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">is good</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.399" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">um and it appears as though any truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">claims i make about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">are then just going to be little um</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">congealed crystallizations like</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">even a scientific truth and anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">they&#39;re still going to be um</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">they&#39;re still going to be um</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">belief structures in a sense so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference i suppose between</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">all between meta modern faith and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">earlier religions would be that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">the belief structures themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">believed to be false</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.519" style="s2">meaning that and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">headless god came in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.519" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">it comes in which i promise i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">that whereas you know muhammad</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">he moves the mountain he comes down he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">a prophet</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">um and he&#39;s you know he&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">one-to-one basis with god he&#39;s talked to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">the man</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">and he knows all about what the truth</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">and then there it is the universal truth</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">and of course people do respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">because he has found something</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">profoundly universal for his day and age</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:58.279" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">now people there believe that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.279" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">universality</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">is there and if you go against that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">universality</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">you um</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re blaspheming you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">going against the truth itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">and hey if you go against the truth</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">you&#39;re going you&#39;re going to fall off a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">cliff we might as well stop you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">now the metamodern god because we</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">started for pure emptiness from</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">you know the cruelest joke nihilism that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">um because we started from there this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">an anti-fragile god</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">we can kick him around or her or it or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">i amness it&#39;s just gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">stronger for it you know we&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">to always whenever well there&#39;s this old</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">if you see buddha in the streets go kill</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">him um</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">and um and this that kind of translates</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">to this stuff right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">um the point isn&#39;t any particular belief</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">structure that we might have it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">process itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">of this profound skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">and this profound skepticism at its core</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">if you understand it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:15.279" style="s2">deeply enough you see that at the core</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">of the skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">at the core of on the cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">is nevertheless faith it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">the less and and you cannot remove it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">that that&#39;s also the thing so nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">was always fake it never existed</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">not even in nietzsche it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:38.880" style="s2">they will give themselves away the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">moment you look like</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.880" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">sooner or later the nihilist will always</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">say like wait a minute that&#39;s not fair</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">fair you said according to whom</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">according to what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">um and there there are negative lists at</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">the core of it is the faith and we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">to purify that faith and deepen that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">and just go deeper and deeper and kill</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">kill our own gods right</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">and so we kind of we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">reconstructing a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">uh a kind couple of nuggets from from</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">from religions here</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">we&#39;re reconstructing the the enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">the enlightened one whenever you start</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">believing in somebody being enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">you well you know go kill that figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">go kill your own god</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the real deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s in the process it&#39;s in the truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">next one we reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">christianity okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">so what happens when you&#39;ve killed god</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">well he comes back three days later</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">annoying as he is</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">because uh you&#39;re gonna have a new</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">based on wherever you are in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">thought process or in that dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">and uh and you&#39;re gonna start believing</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">until you realize what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">then you need to revolt and kill them</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">so always remember always on the give</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">way to the guilty the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.960" style="s2">headless god always on the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">cross</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.960" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">other reconstructions um the devil</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">so this actually goes much farther back</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:28.839" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">christianity though so is the devil real</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.839" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">yeah actually yeah i mean it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">the things we were taught</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s so silly maybe i believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">in god but who would believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">devil</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">so we do know that low states are there</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">we do know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">we are going to try to uphold</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">a false reality together which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.560" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">go</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">um and of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">unpack the evil in the last instance</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually evil if you go into it</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">you bust the [ __ ] you understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">what this thing was trying to protect</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">and so on it was always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">protect</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">something smaller from from like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">smaller</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">unit trying to protect itself visa via a</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">solidarity or a bigger system</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">then you notice that um</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">there really is in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">a dark process um</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">that that is all ever present</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">and which we always need to reveal</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">um and if you follow that presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">or if you fall for it you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">suffer or others are gonna suffer</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s by definition why it&#39;s evil</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">and so you are going to hell if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">follow the devil</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">uh and all all of these things are are</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">almost literally true so i mean the</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">they didn&#39;t just make [ __ ] up which is</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">yeah we can go a bit farther back um</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">we always pay a price right you always</p>

<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">stages right so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">when the post fast and the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">religions showed up</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">they try to find one universal truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">they well if you if you go for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">universal you have to kind of give up</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">the particular and and this is present</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">in and like christianity medieval</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">in a fasting culture uh like the hero</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">is a thor figure right so so it&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">fastianism and postpostinism going from</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">from these uh warrior religions to these</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">always the temptation of like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">why don&#39;t we go back to the other</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">but at the same time we must reconstruct</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">uh because it interconnects all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">on a on a spiritual embodied level and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">needs to create the practices for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">but not contained within a religion or a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">because it wouldn&#39;t fit in those</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">and if we try to fit it in those</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">categories it&#39;s going to break</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be a sick version of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">so what we are looking for instead</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">is a kind of reinvention of</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">um of rituals</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">and religious practices that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">that can mean of course um practices of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">and and and uh yoga</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">and contemplative prayer and many other</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">um and it&#39;s singing together or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">people want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">want to do but particularly</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">it has to do with wanting</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">um given that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">and and here we again reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">zoroastrismus stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">um and or or many many cases and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">that while we&#39;re looking at a world</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">that which has utopian potentials</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">and it appears to be fundamentally good</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">where there is great potential for evil</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">and the potential for disaster and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">to make that more utopian thing happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">for real</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">and we want to be transform ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">into agents which resonate with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">potential and do not resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">first potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a non-personal thing is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">transpersonal thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">that we have to do together and we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">to create social practices</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">to do so together successfully</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">so what we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">then is a kind of co-created um</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">ritualism which can contain uh new</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">new new uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">new cross-pollinations across sectors</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">and can can kind of contain the energies</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">uh as it were and and the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">emotional and spiritual energies which</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:03.760" style="s2">for for a meta-modern emergence to occur</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s also a sense of deliverance</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.760" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">but an ironic sense of deliverance</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">which is by the way why we have such</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">figures</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">as the post saint</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:18.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a saint who always fails to be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">saint</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.000" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">uh not because he&#39;s or she</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">is uh um</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">too cool to be a saint just because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">fail</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">this is the same somebody tries to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">saintly and then they fail</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s the post saint we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">even believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">in the saint but in reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">but in reality people can relatively</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">that ideal and we can do that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">together or it can show up in certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">uh certain occasions so that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">post saint that&#39;s an important figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">in metamodern religion we also have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">ironic prophet</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">meaning that um</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:04.560" style="s2">well so we we&#39;re going to need</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">mohammed&#39;s and jesus</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.560" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">and all the rest of them but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">we will need to laugh at them</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">and to partly disdain them and we will</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">need to be partly</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">disgusted by them and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a profit but when you can piss</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it becomes sacred</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">so here here again the occult comes in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">we try we have to integrate the occult</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">like if you have a profit you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">you can&#39;t criticize or touch you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">and for for this reason i also think it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">makes sense to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">fictional characters to part to uh to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">certain extent which</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">by the way what do you think jesus and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">the buddha and muhammad are</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">do you think these are real people</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.160" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">to certain extent i&#39;m sure but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">90 fiction</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">um anyway the way people</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">project on and that&#39;s all fiction</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">so of course why don&#39;t we just have</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">fictional characters and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">own up to that we we need scenes we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">profits</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">uh we just need to make sure we know</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">that we know they&#39;re saying that we know</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">ultimately we&#39;re creating them and we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">need god</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">we just need to know he or she or it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">except we&#39;re still going to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">it except then we&#39;re going to bust our</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">[ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">or bust [ __ ] of one another so then</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">we need religious</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">rituals to contain that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">and um yeah profit could be a community</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">yeah let me think about that for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">moment um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">uh i i wanted to say oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">yeah so just just ending up what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">so so we&#39;re getting a sense of what kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">of religion this is um</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a deeply nihilistic religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">which never</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">which is never those combined with with</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">genuine faith</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">which you then work very very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">purify at the same time you work very</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">very hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">to just um kill all stupid belief</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">including your own and the ones of one</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">another and then you have rituals to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">work on that and it&#39;s a co-creative</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">religion it&#39;s an emergent religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a religion of um of</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">ongoing co-creation a religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">religion of activity which does not</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">believe that in static</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">uh in the static</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">um truth out there</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">uh or or static universality the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">universality of it comes particularly</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">from its rejection of all</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">oh yeah so so so really</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">no actually here i would have been good</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">with um with the powerpoint but</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">what are good um what are good um</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">symbols what what kind of symbolism are</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">we looking for</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.240" style="s2">so again science has clues uh so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">have those</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">there are a bunch of symbols that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">been come quite um</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">popular lately octopus is one people</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">uh people um get tattoos with octopuses</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">and whatnot and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">it&#39;s discussed in netflix shows</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">and books of course but um</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">but the octopus it&#39;s a it&#39;s a alien</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">intelligence this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">a mollusk it&#39;s a big snail um</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s still intelligent but in it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">shape shifter</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">and it um</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">it is very very very fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">it can take many different forms it can</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">squeeze through</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">uh and surprises us and it&#39;s deep down</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">you have you have more trivial examples</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">that are cropping up um</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">but i think like if</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">we imagine a uh meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">church or something right it could also</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">mathematical structures so this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">important because</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">one of the major problems of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">is and a lot of people have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">the developmental theory they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">stage based</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">but the stages don&#39;t actually describe</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">anything like</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2">a staircase or uh or uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">um you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">ladder they describe</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">qualitative shifts into things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">take quite different alien properties</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:07.839" style="s2">at each at its shift or stage right</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">um and it doesn&#39;t look anything like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.839" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.640" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">or like like a like a ladder so people</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">tend to resist them</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">for this reason um particularly</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">your your stage of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">the complexity will incline you towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">uh geographic not geographic geometrical</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:33.440" style="s2">um base structures and how you build</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">your thoughts right</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.440" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">so more complex people will try will</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">often have</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">they they don&#39;t have lines and squares</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">in their head you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">they have donuts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">complex topologies and klein bottles</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:55.839" style="s2">and mobius strips and um</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:55.839" style="s2">and face spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">lawrence attractors that which look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">butterflies</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">and and those</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">are probably the the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:16.240" style="s2">of faith um</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">those are likely the symbols also of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.240" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">meta-modern faith</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">that um they help us</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">look at um at</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">reality in more linear ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">and to approach our spirituality and our</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:36.960" style="s2">meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">uh and our concept making in more</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.960" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">different ways right in more more</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">complex ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">or non-linear ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.839" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">so who&#39;s going to make this happen we</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">see so so we&#39;re envisioning here at</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s not really a church because uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t confine it within those so</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">it pops up here and there</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">and it has arts and co-creation at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">it has deep skepticism and nihilism at</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">the center</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">uh it through this it it creates an</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">implied</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.000" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">or a faith which</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">never which which can never be faked</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">because the faith</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">can only show up when you bust your own</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.839" style="s2">uh belief and that&#39;s when you believe</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.839" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">um and uh we</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">see that this deeper cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">or shared or or spiritual structure</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">uh becomes an attractor point for</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">for all the different changes that need</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">to be come into place for for us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:47.920" style="s2">to take the right turn as as a society</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">or as a as a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">living being but who makes this happen</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">in in the class theory of metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">we posit that that you have a new axis</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">of class</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">where there&#39;s a particular creative</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">class of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">triple h population hippies hacked</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">hackers and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">hipsters um which play this particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">and which are in turn connected in many</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">ways to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">to the unemployed and the prokaryotes</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">and there they then kind of share a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">orthogonal access basically the middle</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.119" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">and work in classes which are still</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">married to</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">the systems of modernity now</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.079" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">a fourth age within this class we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:43.880" style="s2">hipsters hippies and hackers</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">um which are kind of exploit</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.880" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">self-explanatory hippie</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">hipsters are high on cultural capital</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">hippies are good at meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:58.640" style="s2">hackers are good at the information</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">economy and if you combine all those</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.640" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">three you tend to have metamodernists</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">now the fourth age the quadruple age</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">population which is actually a more</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">accurate term for this</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">are the hermetics and i noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">after a while working with this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">uh that wait a minute there is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">some strange difference</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">for first of all the hippies seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">too many and second of all</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">they tend to always get in fights in two</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">camps</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">the hermetics this is called hermetics</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">as uh as the the occult practice of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">renaissance um</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">where hermeticism was when you well you</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">were interested in alchemy you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">interested in all kinds of old symbols</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">you wanted to uh revisit the the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:49.040" style="s2">classics and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">thought that this ancient uh egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.040" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">or which then had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">greek version which of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">had given humanity some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">some kind of primordial wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">retrospect i think we can safely say</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">that they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">sensing in renaissance the attractor</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">point of modernity they thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">they understood that there was this</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">secret big secret pulling</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">humanity forward and because the best</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">example they could find of something</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">that approached that was in antiquity</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">and in in and in ancient philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">they thought that it was hidden there</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">and there was like one pattern behind it</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">all they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">all wrong now in the in the same sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">um in the same sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">hermetics of today are the people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">not don&#39;t play with symbols as</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:52.839" style="s2">symbols who they use symbols</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">and and rituals for that matter to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.839" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2">beyond what you can see with your mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:57:59.599" style="s2">what you can see with your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">mind that is so they use symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.599" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">and occultism and rituals</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">and co-create rituals to push us a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">beyond what we where we could normally</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">in terms of what we can discuss together</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">what we can understand together</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:18.799" style="s2">uh what we can experience together and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.799" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">so so it&#39;s symbolism and ritualism</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:28.960" style="s2">used as um</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:29.280" style="s2">as artifacts for enlightenment or for no</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.960" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.280" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">not for enlightenment for um um</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">for exploration uh beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">our uh our</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">beyond our intellectual limitations as</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">it were</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">which is different from hippies hippies</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">are good at uh somatic therapies they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">good at um</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">taking you on those retreats where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">eat ayahuasca or something but</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">um or drink ayahuasca but um</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">but it&#39;s different it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:05.119" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:06.880" style="s2">and and they they tend to express</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.119" end="00:59:10.559" style="s2">themselves quite differently</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.880" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">so the hermetics have a particular role</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.559" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">in inventing they they actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">fit in very well</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:17.040" style="s2">in the other places right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">the meta modernists they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.040" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">you know working with the silicon valley</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:23.440" style="s2">times or uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">they&#39;re burning man people or they</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.440" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">they do all sorts of these idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">projects and then you have hermetics</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">who who do all of these nerdy symbol</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">right but there&#39;s a special role for</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">as well namely that they can be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">gathering point</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">of meta-modern religion and religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.839" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">um because they</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.119" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">have the inherent drive to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:56.319" style="s2">with rituals and forms and so on uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">so that the rest of us can participate</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.319" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">in it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.839" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">and there are some risks around that of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">course the hermetics particularly</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">are the ones who are because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">occult</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">um leanings and leanings into</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">esotericism they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">more likely to uh to fall into far-right</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">spiritual but not religious so what</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">about that now</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:28.880" style="s2">this will be my last point beforehand um</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">spiritual but not religious um we want</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.880" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">to turn it on its head</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:39.119" style="s2">that is if you buy</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">modernities uh religiosity is</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.119" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">a private thing the only religions that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">are there</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">include belief structures which are</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">painfully false</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">um when it makes sense then you can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">well i still</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:52.880" style="s2">have had spiritual experiences or i</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">believe those are possible and i can</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.880" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">i think those can be meaningful for how</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">redefine your relationship to life and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">existence and i think these are really</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">important and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">spiritual but not religious one</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">but metamodern religion</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">to be a religion but well we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">to post-religion</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">because we&#39;re we&#39;re breaking out of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">the boxes of modernity right</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">um it has to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">help you on a bad day it has to bring</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">what the religions brought</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">it has to bring faith and resolve in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">of a dark and meaningless life</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.960" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">um so because we know</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">that this people vary on these states</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">up and down lower and then higher lower</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:54.640" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">subjective states we know that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">at all times but you can be religious</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">at all times you can never lose your</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:06.559" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">unless of course something happens to</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.559" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">that this part of your brain</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">where you yeah where those things are</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">stored but</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">even in the darkest hour you can have</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">your faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">um and the more you kicked your faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">around and pissed on it on a good day</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">the more robust it gets</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">um and if you have a community that</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">helps you</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:36.160" style="s2">shoot down your own faith and lynch your</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">god to death</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.160" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">every three days then you have a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">robust god</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:45.359" style="s2">and you know he&#39;s coming back on</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">thursday</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.359" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">so we&#39;re not looking so i want to kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:54.240" style="s2">end this stupid religious no no um</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">spiritual but not religious in</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.240" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">meta-modern religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">we need to admit that it is a religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">we never caught out we never got out of</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">religion we&#39;re going to link all things</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">together we&#39;re going to have faith</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make it make sure this</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">faith is the best</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">possible highest quality possible faith</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:13.599" style="s2">we can have</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">and the deepest and most embodied</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.599" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">possible faith we can have</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.599" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">so yeah so so the conclusion becomes</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.480" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">religious but not spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">um and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">i think in the future we we will more</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">and more</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">because our lives become harder and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">these uh times ahead</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">we&#39;ll need to be religious but not</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">and just on a spiritual day we&#39;ll thank</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">question or was it more just</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">a comment uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:20.559" style="s2">sure the one about the um like grounding</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:23.280" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.559" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">in the deities or made up yeah yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.280" end="01:04:26.559" style="s2">was just wondering daniel that idea you</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">presented</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">um about making up characters and having</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">be these uh symbolic grounds for faith</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:39.680" style="s2">is there i know that that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">um like with union archetypes or tibetan</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.680" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">deities that these</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.520" end="01:04:46.960" style="s2">symbolic entities can very effectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">uh represent personal qualities and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.960" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">can feel into them</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:51.119" style="s2">and and all that kind of thing when it</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">comes to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.119" end="01:04:57.280" style="s2">faith i&#39;m wondering uh if</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">if made-up characters can effectively</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">ground a sense of faith especially</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">because there&#39;s like a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.480" style="s2">emotional relational aspect to faith i</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">um and i&#39;m wondering how well a made-up</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:11.839" style="s2">character can</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">can play that role and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.839" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2">if you have any examples of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">happening effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">with a made-up saint or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">so yeah there you go uh so</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:33.839" style="s2">um i i think i mean the the main example</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">uh are all the present um</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.839" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">saints from from from christianity and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">and you know all the llamas</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:45.760" style="s2">it just kind of goes on i mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">in a sense we have to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.760" end="01:05:52.480" style="s2">well yeah they&#39;re impressive</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re not real no uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">and and that&#39;s kind of cruel in a way</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of just sounds uh sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:05.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">unromantic or at all</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.520" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">sounds a bit cynical i guess to just say</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:16.880" style="s2">dude jesus ain&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:20.160" style="s2">um but it&#39;s the truth probably you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.880" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">and you you look around</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.160" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">so show me a guru that</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t dissolve once people</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.839" end="01:06:35.599" style="s2">come you know come up the scenes</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:37.200" style="s2">once people examined it him or her more</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.599" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">closely</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.200" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">and just just given this experience um</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">they were all made up either way so i</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:51.520" style="s2">the faithful thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:53.839" style="s2">is to say well</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.520" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">we&#39;re going to face up the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.839" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">face the truth that our saints are made</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:06:59.760" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to make up the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.760" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">awesome scenes that we need</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:09.119" style="s2">um and in that in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:11.039" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re gonna be more real and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.119" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">they can&#39;t come apart at the seams</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.039" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">because we made them and defined them as</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">and the post saint is a person who</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.000" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">approaches that ideal</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">but isn&#39;t it um</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know i i think whenever you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.119" style="s2">get like to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:34.079" style="s2">to a ton like whenever you get to</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.119" end="01:07:36.799" style="s2">station or um whenever you get to</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.079" end="01:07:38.720" style="s2">you utopia in any sense you know whether</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a person whether it&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">heaven or anything like that um</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">yeah i mean uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:53.039" style="s2">yeah we we&#39;re not quite doing our job</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:54.799" style="s2">we have a natural tendency to want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.039" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">rest somewhere you know like oh</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.799" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">if things were only like that if people</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">were only like this person if</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.240" style="s2">if i could only get close to this one or</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">if i could only understand what this</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:07.760" style="s2">person is saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">um but reality doesn&#39;t appear to be that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.760" end="01:08:12.559" style="s2">uh reality appears to be uh co-created</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">love and tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.559" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">um which is always eternally</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:21.679" style="s2">broken um and always on its way</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">so i mean that&#39;s the only answer i have</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.679" end="01:08:25.759" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:27.759" style="s2">yeah it would be cool if</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.759" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">we need a real person we&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.759" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">have to make them as real as we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">and and that&#39;s i guess the difference</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:36.480" style="s2">like people mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">people are gonna ask like are you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.480" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">serious like can you really believe in</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">something you know is made up</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">and well and i think the the meta</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:47.199" style="s2">modernist answer is yeah i can believe</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">it because it&#39;s made up</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.199" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:58.239" style="s2">do you want to respond christian</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">i&#39;ll briefly respond i i</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">gel a lot with what you&#39;re saying about</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">how you&#39;ve set up the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">these saints but</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">where my question is more about is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:19.600" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">and even though it kind of addresses the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">problem i wonder if</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:24.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s practical like once people say</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:27.520" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.799" end="01:09:29.600" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not real and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.520" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">going to have to accept that</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.600" end="01:09:35.759" style="s2">do they still effectively ground one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:38.799" style="s2">sense of faith in a deep emotional way</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.759" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">and do you maybe i would ask you</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:46.080" style="s2">personally do you have like uh made up</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.880" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">uh um you know faith symbols in your</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.080" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:49.679" style="s2">or saints that and that&#39;s like doing a</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">good job</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.679" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">for you to ground yours you know more</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">aspirations or principles</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">so i mean um in terms of spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:08.560" style="s2">practice i&#39;m not that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">far ahead um so uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.560" end="01:10:14.000" style="s2">so i as a theorist i can say well</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">this is where it&#39;s gonna have to go</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.000" end="01:10:18.239" style="s2">because this might make sense but</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">uh on on my own small little scale i</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.239" end="01:10:24.480" style="s2">mean there&#39;s hansee fried knocked</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">so hansi frank is a philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.480" end="01:10:30.719" style="s2">and he prophetically</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">says what&#39;s going to happen in the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.719" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">people can have a bash at it you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">and you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">in modern life with the con with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">institutions and roles and stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">are played here</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">to to do that you can&#39;t say like hey</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">here&#39;s the book i wrote it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">everything and where we&#39;re going with</p>

<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:51.920" style="s2">but there was a sincerity uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.120" end="01:11:52.679" style="s2">and striving and faith to it which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">attached</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.679" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">particularly to the fact that you can</p>

<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:06.480" style="s2">of normal rules right</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.520" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">and also i think became more real in</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.480" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">many people&#39;s lives than</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">it would have been if me and my buddy</p>

<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:16.880" style="s2">here here we are with blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">which is interesting because we were</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.880" end="01:12:21.920" style="s2">nevertheless more real</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:23.040" style="s2">than we would have been um if we just</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.920" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.040" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">come out of nowhere and presented the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">books or our ideas from</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">from our own uh roles</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">uh i&#39;m not sure how far it extrapolates</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:41.040" style="s2">but i just think</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">on a fundamental sense in a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.040" end="01:12:45.360" style="s2">on a fundamental level</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">it just makes sense that it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.360" end="01:12:50.719" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">because whatever real</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.719" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">object of worship we&#39;re gonna have like</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">wow</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">going to find the ikea</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">thing um sooner or later you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:11.880" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">if you have accepted post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.880" end="01:13:15.360" style="s2">anti-essentialism you&#39;re always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.360" end="01:13:19.040" style="s2">that moment when you run behind the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">curtains and you see the wizard of oz</p>

<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:34.480" style="s2">fundamental level it</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.159" end="01:13:36.719" style="s2">i think just</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.480" end="01:13:39.280" style="s2">sense making leads us there towards this</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.719" end="01:13:39.280" style="s2">kind of faith</p>

<p begin="01:14:10.960" end="01:14:13.360" style="s2">consciously turning yourself into a</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:16.000" style="s2">fiction</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.360" end="01:14:16.960" style="s2">i recall the nordic larp scene and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.000" end="01:14:20.080" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with it</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.960" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">uh they have a concept uh called bleed</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.080" end="01:14:23.679" style="s2">so you uh you take on the character and</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:24.800" style="s2">then the characters traits bleeds into</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.679" end="01:14:26.159" style="s2">your personality</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.800" end="01:14:27.199" style="s2">and this could have negative effects it</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.159" end="01:14:28.719" style="s2">could negatively bleed into your</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.199" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">personality or you can consciously use</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.719" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">it for like therapeutic reasons</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">and then and then you you gain the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">positive traits of the character you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">adopting</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:39.040" style="s2">um and it sort of has this alchemic</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.040" end="01:14:40.840" style="s2">effect in changing your personality</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.040" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">can it be used for you know faithful</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.840" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">purposes and</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">even just to speak personally on myself</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">now that i came out of the stoic closet</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">since clovid came online</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:50.560" style="s2">it feels like my avatar and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">spectacle is</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.560" end="01:14:53.840" style="s2">like this being projected on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">actually making me become more virtuous</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.840" end="01:14:56.480" style="s2">to kind of live up to that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.120" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">having an interesting kind of effect</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:16.640" style="s2">is defined as the sovereign so somebody</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">says i&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.640" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">and um if people believe him</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:25.600" style="s2">he is king if people say no actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to kill you with pitchforks</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:30.880" style="s2">uh then you&#39;re not the king and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">sooner or later people do say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.880" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">going to kill you with pitchforks</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">and then you say no because my knights</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:38.880" style="s2">are going to trample you</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.679" end="01:17:40.560" style="s2">and then if the knights do trample them</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.880" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">the pitchfork the rest of the pitchfork</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.560" end="01:17:44.400" style="s2">people go home and they say</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.400" end="01:17:45.840" style="s2">okay danielle was kidding so they</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.400" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">believe you now</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.840" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">and now you are per definition the king</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:52.640" style="s2">now the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:54.560" style="s2">happens whenever we make a claim any</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.640" end="01:17:57.280" style="s2">claim any social claim</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.560" end="01:17:58.719" style="s2">i come in a room and i say i&#39;m daniel</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">and if you guys don&#39;t believe me you</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.719" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">guys say no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:06.159" style="s2">daniel you&#39;re nils</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:08.480" style="s2">then i&#39;m not daniel because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.159" end="01:18:11.840" style="s2">believe me</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.480" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">and the same kind of goes for religion</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.840" end="01:18:15.360" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">as we said that the belief structure is</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.360" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">the thin part of religion and the faith</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">part is the big</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:23.520" style="s2">the big part um and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.679" end="01:18:25.280" style="s2">to get the most robust faith we have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.520" end="01:18:27.520" style="s2">be as cynical and cruel</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.280" end="01:18:28.640" style="s2">as possible to all of the beliefs which</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.520" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">is why</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.640" end="01:18:34.960" style="s2">we kill off all of the belief structures</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:39.120" style="s2">and do so repeatedly right</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.960" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">so just seeing this mechanism that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.120" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">life is you know that there is this</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">um there&#39;s this um shakespeare</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:53.840" style="s2">thing um life is a play</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.760" end="01:18:55.600" style="s2">all the men and women merely players one</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.840" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">man in his time plays</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.600" end="01:19:03.440" style="s2">many parts something like that um</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:06.320" style="s2">and that of course goes</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.440" end="01:19:06.880" style="s2">becomes even more true whenever we make</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.320" end="01:19:08.880" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.880" end="01:19:10.640" style="s2">truth claims whenever we make truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.880" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">claims about the self or we make truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.640" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">claims about the nature of reality and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.960" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:16.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.080" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">but those truth claims are then then</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">affect</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:26.239" style="s2">us and that&#39;s the point so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.480" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">the kind of religion that we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.239" end="01:19:30.719" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">optimizes for that process whereby</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.719" end="01:19:37.840" style="s2">we create useful fictions which don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:37.840" style="s2">outlive their usefulness</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.920" end="01:19:43.120" style="s2">and which then strengthen the faith</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.560" end="01:19:46.640" style="s2">which is an experience</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:50.320" style="s2">which goes back to spirituality part um</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.640" end="01:19:53.600" style="s2">so so i mean so so that we optimize</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.320" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">for the experience of faith which lasts</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">even on a bad day right</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.880" end="01:20:02.640" style="s2">um and that includes then of course our</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.640" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">own rules and who am i</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.640" end="01:20:08.080" style="s2">who are you what is right or wrong</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:10.159" style="s2">what is really real and so on but all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.080" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">these are ultimately fictions because we</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.159" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">ultimate reality because the eyes are</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">belong to no one and that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:20.800" style="s2">the death of god means</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">with the entrance of post-modern insight</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.800" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">in nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.760" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">he says god is dead and what he</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.880" end="01:20:32.639" style="s2">maybe or probably really means is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">there is no ultimate umpire no no</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.639" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">objective reality which we can defer to</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">and in that sense i mean it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:42.480" style="s2">god in the sky</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:44.480" style="s2">silly god is dead it&#39;s like serious god</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.480" end="01:20:47.120" style="s2">is dead like nobody&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.480" end="01:20:48.000" style="s2">really there&#39;s no objective reality no</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.120" end="01:20:50.800" style="s2">ultimate empire</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.000" end="01:20:50.800" style="s2">umpire right</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.199" end="01:20:54.239" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">yeah i like that i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.400" end="01:21:00.800" style="s2">follow-up question just maybe a thought</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s an art form to create uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.800" end="01:21:04.239" style="s2">useful fiction</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:05.120" style="s2">um because the hanzi finale character</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.239" end="01:21:06.960" style="s2">you know it</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.120" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">maps over to your your skill set your</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.960" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">temperament and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:13.520" style="s2">um and so i i can see you can be good at</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:15.679" style="s2">creating useful fictions and bad at it</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.520" end="01:21:16.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious how to cultivate that</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.679" end="01:21:20.639" style="s2">art form</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.880" end="01:21:23.199" style="s2">yeah yeah so hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.639" end="01:21:25.520" style="s2">hopefully the kind of like metamodern</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.199" end="01:21:25.520" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.600" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">stupid stupid term but hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.840" end="01:21:35.199" style="s2">the network congregation of people</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.320" end="01:21:35.199" style="s2">playing around</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.880" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">can hold rituals which support that</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.639" end="01:21:44.960" style="s2">and keep us seen through the process we</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:47.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t really talk about that part</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.960" end="01:21:48.880" style="s2">we talked about short briefly but we</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.280" end="01:21:50.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t touch about the part that</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.880" end="01:21:53.120" style="s2">you pay a psychological price of course</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.960" end="01:21:55.040" style="s2">for working harder</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.120" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">and these more generative religions</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.040" end="01:21:57.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:05.679" style="s2">so that makes me think of rob&#39;s earlier</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.960" end="01:22:09.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.679" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">might have uh some tie-in with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.040" end="01:22:13.120" style="s2">are you still here yeah um so hearing</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:14.960" style="s2">you discuss the way that religious</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.120" end="01:22:16.400" style="s2">claims have been almost literally true</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.960" end="01:22:17.840" style="s2">it sounds like there&#39;s a principle by</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.400" end="01:22:19.440" style="s2">which metamodernism</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.840" end="01:22:21.040" style="s2">retrieves the religious truths that</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.440" end="01:22:22.880" style="s2">modernism rejected</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.040" end="01:22:24.719" style="s2">so it seems to have something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.880" end="01:22:26.239" style="s2">their evolutionary memetic fitness and</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.719" end="01:22:27.600" style="s2">something to do with their psychological</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.239" end="01:22:29.120" style="s2">utility</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.600" end="01:22:30.719" style="s2">but i wanted to hear you say more about</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.120" end="01:22:31.920" style="s2">the principle that&#39;s used to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.719" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">retrieve and integrate</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.920" end="01:22:37.440" style="s2">those pre-modern claims and like how do</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.800" end="01:22:37.440" style="s2">you sort those</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.760" end="01:22:44.719" style="s2">so so very very very very good um i</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.960" end="01:22:47.040" style="s2">um first of all i don&#39;t know uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.719" end="01:22:48.320" style="s2">you just kind of notice that wait a</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.040" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">minute this is true</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.320" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">in that sense but but uh that being said</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:56.719" style="s2">um there&#39;s more to say about it first of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.719" end="01:22:59.920" style="s2">if we apply an evolutionary lens to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.040" end="01:23:02.960" style="s2">religions and</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.920" end="01:23:05.920" style="s2">and you know draw them out over history</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.960" end="01:23:06.400" style="s2">there&#39;s clear pattern i mean looking at</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.920" end="01:23:10.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.400" end="01:23:14.239" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s take um mannequism</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.080" end="01:23:17.920" style="s2">which is very you know early or asterisk</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.239" end="01:23:19.920" style="s2">and compare it to uh sikhism</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.920" end="01:23:22.400" style="s2">so if you look at sikhism well there are</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.920" end="01:23:25.920" style="s2">10 gurus there it&#39;s it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.400" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">well it sounds a lot like there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.920" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">of modernity in there you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.480" end="01:23:39.360" style="s2">a universality there&#39;s the same god</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.080" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">and in hinduism and in islam</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.360" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a rejection of particularities</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:50.000" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:52.159" style="s2">there&#39;s an emphasis on own experience</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.000" end="01:23:55.199" style="s2">and your own wisdom and growth</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.159" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">and individuality to that uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.199" end="01:24:01.199" style="s2">there&#39;s um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:03.199" style="s2">i&#39;m sure others who know this better can</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.199" end="01:24:06.320" style="s2">come up with more examples but i mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.199" end="01:24:09.840" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that this is a religion</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.320" end="01:24:12.880" style="s2">that is um created on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.840" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">on the eve of modernity right or</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.880" end="01:24:18.239" style="s2">or uh bahrain is um is</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:20.480" style="s2">is created in modern times or or new</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.239" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">thought is created in modern times and</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.480" end="01:24:26.800" style="s2">and and so is of course new age religion</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:27.679" style="s2">uh protestantism also on the eve or on</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.800" end="01:24:30.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.679" end="01:24:33.920" style="s2">at the onset of modernity it has</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.800" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">all these things it gets rid of</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.920" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">the saints it gets rid of</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.080" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">gets rid of a lot of authority it places</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.560" end="01:24:44.800" style="s2">things back in</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.400" end="01:24:46.000" style="s2">individual faith uh individual</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.800" end="01:24:50.520" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.000" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">it aligns with uh um</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.520" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">inter-subjectivity that i can you and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:55.760" style="s2">can have a</p>

<p begin="01:24:55.760" end="01:24:59.199" style="s2">not this</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.040" end="01:25:01.199" style="s2">this is a good way to to follow the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.199" end="01:25:05.040" style="s2">bible or not</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.199" end="01:25:07.199" style="s2">um so so this</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.040" end="01:25:08.239" style="s2">development of memetic metamometic</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">development is</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.239" end="01:25:15.600" style="s2">obviously visible throughout now</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:16.880" style="s2">what the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.600" end="01:25:18.960" style="s2">there is a bad way to do the</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.880" end="01:25:22.400" style="s2">reconstruction and this was what will be</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.960" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">warned about when he talked about um</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.400" end="01:25:25.600" style="s2">what he talked about joseph campbell and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:28.400" style="s2">stuff that and</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.600" end="01:25:29.920" style="s2">i mean i i sometimes get too sentimental</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.400" end="01:25:33.199" style="s2">so i do this too</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.920" end="01:25:35.840" style="s2">now um that um</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.199" end="01:25:37.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll look at what they&#39;re saying in</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.840" end="01:25:42.639" style="s2">pripasana</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.040" end="01:25:45.280" style="s2">for instance and it&#39;s 2500 years old</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.639" end="01:25:46.719" style="s2">uh terabot in buddhism and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.280" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">pretty basic</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.719" end="01:25:51.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s uh in its philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:52.400" style="s2">assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.040" end="01:25:54.639" style="s2">and i&#39;ll sit there and i&#39;ll like come</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.400" end="01:25:56.480" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.639" end="01:25:58.239" style="s2">and i&#39;ll interpret it i&#39;ll reinterpret</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.480" end="01:25:59.280" style="s2">it in a i guess you could say meta</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.239" end="01:26:02.080" style="s2">modern framework</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.280" end="01:26:03.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll do it i&#39;ll be very gracious with it</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.080" end="01:26:05.440" style="s2">getting out of there</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.840" end="01:26:07.760" style="s2">talking to the other people you notice</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.440" end="01:26:10.880" style="s2">how literally a lot of them have</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.760" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">taken a lot of these ideas and they</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.880" end="01:26:16.239" style="s2">literally think well</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:18.560" style="s2">so with the mind when you sleep</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.239" end="01:26:20.560" style="s2">you rest your body and your mind so you</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.560" end="01:26:23.120" style="s2">can exchange sleep for</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.560" end="01:26:24.719" style="s2">just resting and meditating because then</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.120" end="01:26:25.120" style="s2">you&#39;re resting your body and your mind</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.719" end="01:26:28.480" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.120" end="01:26:30.960" style="s2">i mean which is just patently false um</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.480" end="01:26:31.760" style="s2">but they will literally believe it uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.960" end="01:26:33.520" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.760" end="01:26:35.199" style="s2">well i i thought they meant something</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.520" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">else a little bit right</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.199" end="01:26:41.520" style="s2">so so the bad way to do it the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">um the joseph campbell way to do it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.520" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">you retrieve stuff and you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.800" end="01:26:49.280" style="s2">excuse um the developmental</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:51.040" style="s2">irregularities which don&#39;t make sense in</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.280" end="01:26:51.440" style="s2">your time right and then you kind of get</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.040" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.440" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">somewhat too naive worldview and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:57.679" style="s2">too gracious</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:27:01.600" style="s2">view of religions and an uncritical</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.679" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">view now</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.600" end="01:27:07.360" style="s2">that being said um</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:10.880" style="s2">what richard dawkins and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.360" end="01:27:13.280" style="s2">people do and the new atheists do</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.880" end="01:27:14.960" style="s2">they just attack religion and they think</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.280" end="01:27:17.440" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.960" end="01:27:19.199" style="s2">starts at modernity and before that</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.440" end="01:27:21.440" style="s2">people were just stupid</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.199" end="01:27:24.239" style="s2">and people need to stop being stupid and</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.440" end="01:27:26.880" style="s2">these these ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.239" end="01:27:28.800" style="s2">are you know putting putting dumb</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.880" end="01:27:33.120" style="s2">thoughts in their heads</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.800" end="01:27:36.239" style="s2">uh what um</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.120" end="01:27:36.239" style="s2">what is um</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:41.280" style="s2">well that doesn&#39;t hold up because a lot</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.560" end="01:27:44.239" style="s2">of the things</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.280" end="01:27:45.520" style="s2">if you look at what they&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.239" end="01:27:48.239" style="s2">existential core</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:27:49.440" style="s2">of what&#39;s being said if you remove all</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.239" end="01:27:54.480" style="s2">belief structures</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.440" end="01:27:56.320" style="s2">and you just look at what is the point</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.480" end="01:27:57.520" style="s2">a lot of them these things will be</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.320" end="01:28:00.480" style="s2">profoundly true</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.520" end="01:28:02.239" style="s2">true almost at the one plus one is two</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:06.239" style="s2">mathematical level</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.239" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">so for instance buddhism says</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.239" end="01:28:10.880" style="s2">sin is a mistake it&#39;s when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:13.520" style="s2">have knowledge about the world</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.880" end="01:28:15.679" style="s2">and what you do does not give you</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.520" end="01:28:20.320" style="s2">desirable consequences</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.679" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">oh is that true or not yes it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.320" end="01:28:25.520" style="s2">christianity says in the sermon on the</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:25.520" style="s2">mount</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.159" end="01:28:34.239" style="s2">look if you&#39;re forgiven you&#39;re forgiven</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.960" end="01:28:37.120" style="s2">it means that even if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.239" end="01:28:37.440" style="s2">kill the boss of children yesterday if</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.120" end="01:28:40.960" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.440" end="01:28:44.320" style="s2">really really really really regret it</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.960" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">and you&#39;re no longer that person</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.320" end="01:28:50.639" style="s2">and you made amends</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">then you&#39;re okay because per definition</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.639" end="01:28:54.320" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:55.679" style="s2">right like because there is no soul</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.320" end="01:28:57.600" style="s2">nobody&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.679" end="01:28:58.719" style="s2">well you were a bad person yesterday yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.600" end="01:29:00.719" style="s2">you were</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.719" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">um that was really bad don&#39;t kill a bus</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.719" end="01:29:05.120" style="s2">of children but now</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">you&#39;re doing fine and you&#39;re and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.120" end="01:29:10.159" style="s2">a kind person</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">and by definition you&#39;re kind and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.159" end="01:29:13.679" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to attach anything</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:17.040" style="s2">particular to</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.679" end="01:29:20.880" style="s2">badness to your soul then per definition</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.040" end="01:29:24.239" style="s2">and then you are forgiven right um</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.880" end="01:29:26.880" style="s2">so um i mean all of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.239" end="01:29:28.320" style="s2">those things that are true no matter</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.880" end="01:29:30.239" style="s2">what right</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.320" end="01:29:32.639" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t have anything with jesus</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.239" end="01:29:35.920" style="s2">walking on water or anything like that</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.639" end="01:29:38.639" style="s2">but the the</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.920" end="01:29:40.320" style="s2">when you draw out what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.639" end="01:29:42.800" style="s2">what&#39;s being said</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.320" end="01:29:42.800" style="s2">then um</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.320" end="01:29:47.760" style="s2">then that can be true then if you want</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.120" end="01:29:50.719" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.760" end="01:29:52.000" style="s2">play with one more step a lot one step</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.719" end="01:29:54.000" style="s2">farther you can go through with things</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.000" end="01:29:57.280" style="s2">like okay mohammed moosa mountain</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.000" end="01:30:00.880" style="s2">um is that true well</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.280" end="01:30:04.639" style="s2">well what it really says is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.880" end="01:30:07.480" style="s2">if you go for the universal truth</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.639" end="01:30:10.400" style="s2">and uh you disregard your</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.480" end="01:30:13.360" style="s2">particularities of perspective</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.400" end="01:30:14.159" style="s2">uh you can make bigger things happen</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.360" end="01:30:17.280" style="s2">because you are</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.159" end="01:30:19.120" style="s2">moving universal things and things that</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.280" end="01:30:20.960" style="s2">because you&#39;re dealing with universal</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.120" end="01:30:23.280" style="s2">qualities for instance</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.960" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">so i mean you could you can stretch it a</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.280" end="01:30:26.719" style="s2">little bit farther like that</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:28.880" style="s2">in that sense you can reconstruct</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.719" end="01:30:32.239" style="s2">miracles as well so okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.880" end="01:30:33.199" style="s2">um yeah jesus he can feed a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.239" end="01:30:37.040" style="s2">people with it with</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.199" end="01:30:39.120" style="s2">just fish and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.040" end="01:30:41.120" style="s2">um well what it says is if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.120" end="01:30:45.520" style="s2">charitable life tends to</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.120" end="01:30:46.880" style="s2">create abundance yeah that&#39;s true so so</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.520" end="01:30:49.120" style="s2">it depends on how far you want to</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.880" end="01:30:50.480" style="s2">stretch it i i suggest we stop at the</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.120" end="01:30:53.360" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.480" end="01:30:55.760" style="s2">existential ones like yeah per</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.360" end="01:30:58.719" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.760" end="01:31:00.080" style="s2">forgiveness is real and if you forgive</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.719" end="01:31:02.400" style="s2">you are freed</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.080" end="01:31:03.199" style="s2">that&#39;s true that&#39;s universally true you</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.400" end="01:31:06.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.199" end="01:31:07.600" style="s2">um yeah and on it goes we can we can</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.000" end="01:31:09.840" style="s2">retrieve others from other religions</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.600" end="01:31:09.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.679" end="01:31:14.560" style="s2">any follow-up rob</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.800" end="01:31:20.239" style="s2">um yeah so i i guess i would say</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.320" end="01:31:21.440" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t sound altogether different</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.239" end="01:31:23.920" style="s2">from the modernist</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.440" end="01:31:25.040" style="s2">view of some of these religions which is</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.920" end="01:31:26.480" style="s2">their objection is</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.040" end="01:31:27.840" style="s2">well then why would we need religion at</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.480" end="01:31:29.920" style="s2">all don&#39;t we just know that forgiveness</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.840" end="01:31:32.320" style="s2">is good and we can move on</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.920" end="01:31:34.320" style="s2">so like answering that with a</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.320" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">metamodernist perspective it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.320" end="01:31:40.400" style="s2">is a bit more of a dance between</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:43.199" style="s2">um like the useful fiction and the sort</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.400" end="01:31:44.400" style="s2">of modernist realism how would you</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.199" end="01:31:46.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how would you respond to</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.400" end="01:31:48.080" style="s2">that yeah i mean again now you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.960" end="01:31:49.920" style="s2">chair</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.080" end="01:31:51.840" style="s2">to the modernists most modernists i</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.920" end="01:31:54.320" style="s2">would talk to they just say no religion</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.840" end="01:31:57.520" style="s2">is stupid stop listening to it you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.320" end="01:32:00.880" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t say that they just say</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.520" end="01:32:03.920" style="s2">jesus is not good he says that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.880" end="01:32:05.360" style="s2">he&#39;s um god himself and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.920" end="01:32:07.840" style="s2">anybody&#39;s going to hell if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.360" end="01:32:12.400" style="s2">particularly follow him</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.840" end="01:32:14.480" style="s2">and whoever believes this needs to</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.400" end="01:32:15.679" style="s2">go take a long look in the mirror and</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.480" end="01:32:19.440" style="s2">figure their life</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.679" end="01:32:22.560" style="s2">you know that&#39;s more more accurate</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.440" end="01:32:24.080" style="s2">what i hear them saying but um</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.560" end="01:32:25.600" style="s2">but even so if we if we do take the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.080" end="01:32:28.800" style="s2">gracious</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.600" end="01:32:31.679" style="s2">view of modernists and they will say</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.800" end="01:32:33.280" style="s2">yes forgiveness is universally true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.679" end="01:32:37.760" style="s2">like okay</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.280" end="01:32:42.560" style="s2">um but then point me</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.760" end="01:32:44.960" style="s2">to another philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.560" end="01:32:46.400" style="s2">which emerged under modernity which says</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.960" end="01:32:48.960" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.400" end="01:32:50.080" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t and the reason it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.960" end="01:32:53.120" style="s2">is that as we</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.080" end="01:32:55.840" style="s2">said earlier um at every stage you pay a</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.120" end="01:32:56.880" style="s2">terrible price for the new freedom gain</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.840" end="01:32:59.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.880" end="01:33:00.400" style="s2">and what you what what you gained was</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.520" end="01:33:04.000" style="s2">was uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.400" end="01:33:06.800" style="s2">was freedom independence um</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.000" end="01:33:07.760" style="s2">dignity of a certain kind but you lost</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.800" end="01:33:10.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.760" end="01:33:13.920" style="s2">piousness faith um</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.880" end="01:33:17.440" style="s2">um humility before uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.920" end="01:33:21.440" style="s2">before a universality um this</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.440" end="01:33:25.840" style="s2">service um and and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.440" end="01:33:25.840" style="s2">the set pathway which which</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.920" end="01:33:29.679" style="s2">creates a uh scaffolding for your for</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.880" end="01:33:32.000" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.679" end="01:33:33.199" style="s2">practice right you you lost all of those</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.000" end="01:33:34.800" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.199" end="01:33:37.760" style="s2">so we we&#39;re gonna have to charge the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.800" end="01:33:39.520" style="s2">modernists with like okay sure</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.760" end="01:33:40.880" style="s2">you can throw away the religions as long</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.520" end="01:33:43.120" style="s2">as you give me all those other things</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.880" end="01:33:43.120" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.679" end="01:33:48.840" style="s2">and uh and of course they can&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.480" end="01:33:51.840" style="s2">they&#39;re like yeah we can be socialists</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.840" end="01:33:51.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.560" end="01:34:05.280" style="s2">all right um aditya you had a</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.800" end="01:34:08.000" style="s2">question about communication</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.280" end="01:34:09.920" style="s2">yeah um thanks daniel for all your work</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.000" end="01:34:14.000" style="s2">really appreciate you</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.920" end="01:34:16.719" style="s2">um yeah i wanted to think about um</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.000" end="01:34:19.199" style="s2">the hermetics and that kind of goal if</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.719" end="01:34:21.679" style="s2">there is one of a meta-modern religion</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.199" end="01:34:23.280" style="s2">so it seems like it&#39;s um you know based</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.679" end="01:34:24.320" style="s2">on the sincere belief that there is</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.280" end="01:34:27.920" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.320" end="01:34:31.040" style="s2">and uh maybe there&#39;s many other sincere</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.920" end="01:34:33.360" style="s2">beliefs um so but it feels like</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.040" end="01:34:34.080" style="s2">similar to the complexity communicating</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.360" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.080" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">um complexities</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.520" end="01:34:44.320" style="s2">it seems like a flat across subjective</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.480" end="01:34:46.560" style="s2">states or integrated wisdom from</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.320" end="01:34:48.080" style="s2">higher subjective states communicating</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.560" end="01:34:50.880" style="s2">with the masses</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.080" end="01:34:51.920" style="s2">let&#39;s say so i&#39;m curious what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.880" end="01:34:55.440" style="s2">rational goal</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.920" end="01:34:57.920" style="s2">if we accept that um is it uh</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.440" end="01:35:01.280" style="s2">is it sort of marketing you know i come</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.920" end="01:35:02.719" style="s2">to my ayahuasca event</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.280" end="01:35:04.480" style="s2">experience higher states they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.719" end="01:35:07.040" style="s2">good i promise they&#39;re not so bad</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.480" end="01:35:08.560" style="s2">or is the language itself potentially</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.040" end="01:35:11.679" style="s2">inducing</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.560" end="01:35:13.440" style="s2">um either you know is it psychoactive is</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.679" end="01:35:14.880" style="s2">inducing higher states</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.440" end="01:35:16.480" style="s2">um should we think about it from that</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.880" end="01:35:19.840" style="s2">perspective or</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.480" end="01:35:20.800" style="s2">um or is it conveying the embodied</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.840" end="01:35:22.639" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.800" end="01:35:23.840" style="s2">so how do we think about that or is it</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.639" end="01:35:25.360" style="s2">just marketing</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.840" end="01:35:26.880" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s good enough because</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.360" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">it it&#39;s eventually</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.880" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">pointed towards reducing suffering</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.480" end="01:35:37.199" style="s2">okay yeah well that&#39;s good thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.840" end="01:35:38.239" style="s2">your supportive comments but um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.199" end="01:35:41.600" style="s2">hard question</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.239" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">um i think</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.600" end="01:35:45.119" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll just give you the politics</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.840" end="01:35:47.520" style="s2">answer i actually don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.119" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">true in terms of religion</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.520" end="01:35:54.719" style="s2">so uh the the politics answer</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:57.119" style="s2">is that um we write in</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.719" end="01:36:00.080" style="s2">in the second hanse book nordic ideology</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.119" end="01:36:00.080" style="s2">we write that on</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.560" end="01:36:04.320" style="s2">the opposite populism is political</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.199" end="01:36:07.840" style="s2">metamorphosis</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.320" end="01:36:10.960" style="s2">so populism tries to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.840" end="01:36:11.360" style="s2">for the masses but does so by going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.960" end="01:36:14.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.360" end="01:36:16.560" style="s2">lowest common denominator i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.480" end="01:36:20.080" style="s2">arabs in sweden</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.560" end="01:36:23.440" style="s2">they make fires in their gardens</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.080" end="01:36:25.920" style="s2">here here in in the residential area</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.440" end="01:36:26.960" style="s2">and um they do other crazy stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.920" end="01:36:28.159" style="s2">you&#39;re not supposed to be doing in</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.960" end="01:36:32.320" style="s2">sweden</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.159" end="01:36:35.040" style="s2">um and a good portion of people will</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.320" end="01:36:37.600" style="s2">feel that way and they&#39;ll join the</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.040" end="01:36:41.600" style="s2">populist party or both with them</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.600" end="01:36:42.800" style="s2">whereas but it&#39;s a simple background i</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.600" end="01:36:46.080" style="s2">think right</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.800" end="01:36:49.760" style="s2">and religions are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.080" end="01:36:52.800" style="s2">pop most of the time right</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.760" end="01:36:55.600" style="s2">and metamodern politics</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.800" end="01:36:57.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t relate as an alternative to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.600" end="01:37:00.239" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.040" end="01:37:01.520" style="s2">ideologies and parties it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.239" end="01:37:04.840" style="s2">just one more it</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.520" end="01:37:06.639" style="s2">tends to insert itself as a kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.840" end="01:37:10.080" style="s2">developmental</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.639" end="01:37:11.280" style="s2">axis or yeah fulcrum point for the</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.080" end="01:37:15.360" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.280" end="01:37:17.760" style="s2">um which imbues them with the other</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.360" end="01:37:19.119" style="s2">with other interesting things going on</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.760" end="01:37:22.159" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.119" end="01:37:24.880" style="s2">and um so</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.159" end="01:37:26.719" style="s2">from from a developmental viewpoint</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.880" end="01:37:29.040" style="s2">metamodernists don&#39;t tend to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.719" end="01:37:31.280" style="s2">for or against i don&#39;t know islam you</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.040" end="01:37:32.880" style="s2">know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.280" end="01:37:34.719" style="s2">why would you want to be against islam</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.880" end="01:37:37.280" style="s2">if you look at a pomo islam</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.719" end="01:37:40.320" style="s2">they&#39;re just like a promo christian if</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.280" end="01:37:40.320" style="s2">you look at a modernist</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.440" end="01:37:44.880" style="s2">muslim they tend to be like a modernist</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.679" end="01:37:49.119" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.880" end="01:37:49.520" style="s2">so so most of all we tend to care about</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.119" end="01:37:52.560" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.520" end="01:37:55.679" style="s2">uh developmental traits right and this</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.560" end="01:38:00.320" style="s2">same goes i suppose for for this uh for</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.679" end="01:38:00.320" style="s2">for the religions um that</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.840" end="01:38:04.320" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.000" end="01:38:05.280" style="s2">creating small networks where</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.320" end="01:38:08.320" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.280" end="01:38:09.760" style="s2">stuff happens and we together support</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.320" end="01:38:14.080" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.760" end="01:38:16.159" style="s2">in in developing</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.080" end="01:38:18.159" style="s2">a culture and shared understanding</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.159" end="01:38:19.119" style="s2">across the board which supports us</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.159" end="01:38:23.280" style="s2">spiritually</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.119" end="01:38:26.880" style="s2">and emotionally and socially to</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.280" end="01:38:31.280" style="s2">um to work for uh the modern</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.880" end="01:38:35.920" style="s2">world which which relative utopia</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.280" end="01:38:39.040" style="s2">and in that sense it&#39;s a salvation</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.920" end="01:38:41.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.040" end="01:38:42.719" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s not secret this</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.360" end="01:38:44.480" style="s2">also goes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.719" end="01:38:46.800" style="s2">politics part in the politics it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.480" end="01:38:48.560" style="s2">open conspiracy in the same way here you</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.800" end="01:38:50.320" style="s2">have openness terrorism</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.560" end="01:38:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious now for everyone but</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.320" end="01:38:53.600" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing secret going on we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.760" end="01:38:57.360" style="s2">not killing cats or anything</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.600" end="01:39:01.280" style="s2">so at the same time you can just</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.360" end="01:39:04.320" style="s2">create all of these different uh rituals</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.280" end="01:39:07.760" style="s2">know that they&#39;re not for the masses but</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.320" end="01:39:10.239" style="s2">imbue key agents</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.760" end="01:39:11.360" style="s2">including perhaps of different religions</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.239" end="01:39:13.920" style="s2">or more or less</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.360" end="01:39:14.800" style="s2">i suppose ignoring the other religions</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.920" end="01:39:18.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.800" end="01:39:20.480" style="s2">and just just the fact of having</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.800" end="01:39:22.320" style="s2">the spiritual technologies for the</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.480" end="01:39:25.520" style="s2">people who can uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.320" end="01:39:27.920" style="s2">who can uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.520" end="01:39:29.679" style="s2">or spiritual and religious technologies</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.920" end="01:39:33.760" style="s2">for the people who can</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.679" end="01:39:36.320" style="s2">really make a difference as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.760" end="01:39:37.040" style="s2">network around the world then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.320" end="01:39:40.080" style="s2">good enough</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.040" end="01:39:42.000" style="s2">i think um and</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.080" end="01:39:43.199" style="s2">given that there are developmental</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.000" end="01:39:45.840" style="s2">traits which will</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.199" end="01:39:47.520" style="s2">attract you to different religions most</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.840" end="01:39:49.920" style="s2">people won&#39;t be attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.520" end="01:39:52.000" style="s2">modern religion they&#39;re like so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.920" end="01:39:54.719" style="s2">even a religion no we broke up we broke</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.000" end="01:39:58.480" style="s2">up that uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.719" end="01:40:03.440" style="s2">categorization of reality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.480" end="01:40:05.679" style="s2">and yeah i guess i guess that would be</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.440" end="01:40:07.280" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s a bit of a boring answer</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.679" end="01:40:10.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.280" end="01:40:12.880" style="s2">we um we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.320" end="01:40:14.719" style="s2">so much with it except we can if we can</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.880" end="01:40:17.679" style="s2">even create a</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.719" end="01:40:18.880" style="s2">modern faith among the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.679" end="01:40:21.840" style="s2">naturally drawn to it</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.880" end="01:40:22.639" style="s2">and keep it healthy i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.840" end="01:40:25.360" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.639" end="01:40:25.360" style="s2">enough right</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.000" end="01:40:36.560" style="s2">any follow-up um</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.040" end="01:40:39.199" style="s2">maybe just uh the way i capture it is um</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.560" end="01:40:40.080" style="s2">kind of creating an oasis that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.199" end="01:40:43.440" style="s2">works for</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.080" end="01:40:46.400" style="s2">a subgroup of people um and</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.440" end="01:40:48.480" style="s2">uh maybe that&#39;s you know and it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.400" end="01:40:49.679" style="s2">the opposite of the modernity&#39;s value of</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.480" end="01:40:52.239" style="s2">scaling</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.679" end="01:40:53.920" style="s2">you know marketing it&#39;s sort of um</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.239" end="01:40:55.520" style="s2">create a small as you said relative</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.920" end="01:40:59.440" style="s2">utopia</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.520" end="01:41:02.080" style="s2">um and maybe touch these people</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.440" end="01:41:03.199" style="s2">uh for the limited few for it for which</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.080" end="01:41:05.600" style="s2">it could work like no</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.199" end="01:41:06.480" style="s2">no dreams of it being sort of like a</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.600" end="01:41:09.440" style="s2">global</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.480" end="01:41:11.280" style="s2">single movement like the modern but uh a</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.440" end="01:41:13.520" style="s2">humility in that yeah it works for these</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.280" end="01:41:15.760" style="s2">20 people that live together</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.520" end="01:41:17.600" style="s2">and um they are touched and maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.760" end="01:41:20.480" style="s2">people that visit</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.600" end="01:41:22.719" style="s2">but it&#39;s not um and maybe the networks</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.480" end="01:41:26.400" style="s2">that the this network touches</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.719" end="01:41:29.360" style="s2">um but it&#39;s not um necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.400" end="01:41:31.119" style="s2">more ambitious than that i know i i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.360" end="01:41:32.080" style="s2">probably go more divisions than you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.119" end="01:41:35.199" style="s2">being in a collect</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.080" end="01:41:38.159" style="s2">20 people not enough like that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.199" end="01:41:40.000" style="s2">a small small layer across the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.159" end="01:41:41.920" style="s2">tens of thousands of people maybe</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.000" end="01:41:43.199" style="s2">but hey you know given the co-created</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.920" end="01:41:46.400" style="s2">nature right</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.199" end="01:41:47.119" style="s2">so uh well i instantly notice quality is</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.400" end="01:41:50.719" style="s2">about you</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.119" end="01:41:54.400" style="s2">which i probably can learn a lot from um</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.719" end="01:41:58.880" style="s2">so how do you even scale that right</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.400" end="01:42:02.080" style="s2">uh it&#39;s we&#39;re gonna co-create right</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.880" end="01:42:04.320" style="s2">so it has to be well</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.080" end="01:42:05.679" style="s2">so people have to have the value they</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.320" end="01:42:08.639" style="s2">you know have to come in</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.679" end="01:42:10.400" style="s2">the door with having an embodied value</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.639" end="01:42:14.320" style="s2">of co-creation</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.400" end="01:42:17.760" style="s2">uh emergence</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.320" end="01:42:21.199" style="s2">complexity wanting to explore</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.760" end="01:42:23.280" style="s2">depth and then there&#39;s the natural</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.199" end="01:42:24.560" style="s2">division between us as we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.280" end="01:42:27.520" style="s2">earlier and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.560" end="01:42:28.080" style="s2">former talk between people who have more</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.520" end="01:42:30.400" style="s2">spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.080" end="01:42:32.800" style="s2">experience of life and those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.400" end="01:42:36.960" style="s2">and modernism</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.800" end="01:42:40.880" style="s2">and view them as theology or faith</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.960" end="01:42:44.719" style="s2">um tries to marry uh to</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.880" end="01:42:47.119" style="s2">distinct to distinct kind of people</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.719" end="01:42:48.480" style="s2">uh prickly and probably people or</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.119" end="01:42:52.400" style="s2">whatever you want to call it that</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.480" end="01:42:55.600" style="s2">um yeah so i was just watching this</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.400" end="01:42:56.000" style="s2">video that somebody shared about a new</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.600" end="01:42:58.719" style="s2">way to</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.000" end="01:42:59.679" style="s2">woman and she looks at the camera and</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.719" end="01:43:02.480" style="s2">she says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.679" end="01:43:03.679" style="s2">just ones you know and you can see you</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.480" end="01:43:05.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.679" end="01:43:08.239" style="s2">there&#39;s that presence there&#39;s a depth in</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.840" end="01:43:08.239" style="s2">our eyes</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.639" end="01:43:11.760" style="s2">and this is a high depth high stable</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.239" end="01:43:13.679" style="s2">person and</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.760" end="01:43:15.679" style="s2">just everything about your screens no</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.679" end="01:43:19.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.679" end="01:43:21.760" style="s2">musicality way of moving blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.600" end="01:43:24.239" style="s2">at the same time there are people who</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.760" end="01:43:28.800" style="s2">are hiring complexity</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.239" end="01:43:33.440" style="s2">but not so kind the depth people</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.800" end="01:43:35.679" style="s2">tend to uh not entirely</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.440" end="01:43:36.880" style="s2">grasp more complexity and they tend to</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.679" end="01:43:39.280" style="s2">believe a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.880" end="01:43:40.000" style="s2">stupid things the complexity people tend</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.280" end="01:43:43.600" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.000" end="01:43:45.440" style="s2">um tend to be reductionists</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.600" end="01:43:48.480" style="s2">and kind of miss the point of life in</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.440" end="01:43:48.480" style="s2">existence so</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.199" end="01:43:56.800" style="s2">if we can even marry those two things</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.040" end="01:44:00.080" style="s2">within what i think hermenetics</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.800" end="01:44:04.960" style="s2">uh can create within a new</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.080" end="01:44:04.960" style="s2">porous and and</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.600" end="01:44:13.360" style="s2">fast evolving institutions which</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.760" end="01:44:14.960" style="s2">come and go and blink like this right</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.360" end="01:44:17.199" style="s2">all around the place and build</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.960" end="01:44:20.159" style="s2">collective experience</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.199" end="01:44:21.440" style="s2">and then that i mean if we can do that</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.159" end="01:44:24.000" style="s2">that&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.440" end="01:44:25.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s small or</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.000" end="01:44:26.960" style="s2">that the ambitions are smaller just say</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.679" end="01:44:29.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.960" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">if we look at this it just doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.440" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">sense like well</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.280" end="01:44:36.800" style="s2">what exactly would we say like so we</p>

<p begin="01:45:34.239" end="01:45:38.400" style="s2">gender reconstitution within the model</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.400" end="01:45:40.639" style="s2">of benevolent patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.400" end="01:45:42.239" style="s2">that you described last time and its</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.639" end="01:45:45.600" style="s2">relationship to this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.239" end="01:45:48.639" style="s2">modern religious structure and ritual</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.600" end="01:45:50.239" style="s2">i&#39;m reminded of the d.h lawrence short</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.639" end="01:45:52.159" style="s2">story the man who died</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.239" end="01:45:54.080" style="s2">where jesus comes back from the dead as</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.159" end="01:45:54.880" style="s2">a broken man who finds reconstitution</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.080" end="01:45:58.080" style="s2">and wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.880" end="01:46:01.360" style="s2">by playing out the myth of osiris and</p>

<p begin="01:46:01.360" end="01:46:06.239" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.159" end="01:46:07.040" style="s2">and yeah uh very curious about what you</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.239" end="01:46:10.800" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.040" end="01:46:14.239" style="s2">the criteria for meta-modern post-ritual</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.800" end="01:46:16.560" style="s2">integration in general</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.239" end="01:46:18.080" style="s2">so thanks you can take either of those</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.560" end="01:46:20.000" style="s2">or matter</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.080" end="01:46:21.520" style="s2">second question thanks ryan thanks ryan</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.000" end="01:46:23.119" style="s2">i actually</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.520" end="01:46:24.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s some things that kind of on</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.119" end="01:46:26.960" style="s2">the rim of my mind here</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.560" end="01:46:28.320" style="s2">um which i have been thinking about over</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.960" end="01:46:31.440" style="s2">the last few days</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.320" end="01:46:31.760" style="s2">um so i&#39;m actually glad you brought it</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.440" end="01:46:34.639" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.760" end="01:46:36.159" style="s2">um and things that weren&#39;t really made</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.639" end="01:46:38.880" style="s2">explicit in the last</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.159" end="01:46:40.080" style="s2">talk if we do talk think about the</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.880" end="01:46:43.840" style="s2">reconstruction of</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.080" end="01:46:44.480" style="s2">a benevolent patriarchy we noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.840" end="01:46:47.840" style="s2">there were</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.480" end="01:46:51.199" style="s2">several steps for this to occur</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.840" end="01:46:55.440" style="s2">we noticed that this is appears</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.199" end="01:46:57.520" style="s2">to be this appears to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.440" end="01:46:59.920" style="s2">something that happens only when things</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.520" end="01:47:01.920" style="s2">are getting very very very sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.920" end="01:47:03.119" style="s2">and very very healthy in a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.920" end="01:47:05.520" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.119" end="01:47:07.119" style="s2">um um i mean just you can just put in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.520" end="01:47:07.520" style="s2">little bit of trauma in the wrong place</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.119" end="01:47:10.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.520" end="01:47:14.800" style="s2">boom uh everybody just</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.560" end="01:47:17.440" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.800" end="01:47:18.880" style="s2">everything just implodes basically for</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.440" end="01:47:20.840" style="s2">the relationship and with the people</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.880" end="01:47:23.920" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.840" end="01:47:26.400" style="s2">so and and a reminder</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.920" end="01:47:28.639" style="s2">is that i mean we first have the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.400" end="01:47:33.280" style="s2">emergence of the benevolent patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.639" end="01:47:36.080" style="s2">or matriarchy which is more hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.280" end="01:47:37.600" style="s2">a sharp or steeper hierarchy than the</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.080" end="01:47:39.679" style="s2">benevolent patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.600" end="01:47:40.800" style="s2">and the benevolent patriarchy kind of</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.679" end="01:47:44.159" style="s2">plays</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.800" end="01:47:47.920" style="s2">on the foundation of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.159" end="01:47:52.480" style="s2">level and matriarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.920" end="01:47:56.400" style="s2">as we also said um the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.480" end="01:47:59.679" style="s2">bitterness of gender in our day and age</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.400" end="01:48:02.400" style="s2">uh which we called gender antagonism</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.679" end="01:48:04.159" style="s2">is that people feel let down by the</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.400" end="01:48:05.679" style="s2">venomous patriarchy and the benevolent</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.159" end="01:48:06.159" style="s2">mate the benevolent matriarchy and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.679" end="01:48:09.280" style="s2">vanilla</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.159" end="01:48:11.199" style="s2">patriarchy uh particularly uh</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.280" end="01:48:13.679" style="s2">uh guys who feel let down by the</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.199" end="01:48:16.960" style="s2">benevolent matriarchy feel that</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.679" end="01:48:19.119" style="s2">mom is bad and that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.960" end="01:48:21.360" style="s2">destroy the feminine in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.119" end="01:48:23.119" style="s2">they go fascist</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.360" end="01:48:25.119" style="s2">and this is it goes again and again you</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.119" end="01:48:28.560" style="s2">know look at all the fascist guys</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.119" end="01:48:31.040" style="s2">not one of them will um will be</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.560" end="01:48:32.639" style="s2">in love with women and womanhood and all</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.040" end="01:48:35.040" style="s2">of them will be angry with mom</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.639" end="01:48:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just a black you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.040" end="01:48:39.360" style="s2">if you add</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.080" end="01:48:42.159" style="s2">a benevolent patriarchy on that</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.360" end="01:48:42.880" style="s2">and the betrayals of that patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.159" end="01:48:44.840" style="s2">there you have</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.880" end="01:48:46.080" style="s2">the criminals among the guys you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.840" end="01:48:49.760" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.080" end="01:48:50.880" style="s2">she ever watched that show or that tv</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.760" end="01:48:52.960" style="s2">that was on</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.880" end="01:48:55.360" style="s2">a while ago where they they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.960" end="01:48:57.760" style="s2">prison and they&#39;re doing therapy and</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.360" end="01:48:58.960" style="s2">group therapy with a bunch of you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.760" end="01:49:01.280" style="s2">tough guys</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.960" end="01:49:02.000" style="s2">and daddy issues are all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.280" end="01:49:04.560" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.000" end="01:49:05.760" style="s2">so there are these breaches in this</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.560" end="01:49:08.320" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.760" end="01:49:09.840" style="s2">um in this fundamental psychological</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.320" end="01:49:12.840" style="s2">composition of us</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.840" end="01:49:14.000" style="s2">uh we&#39;re angry mom we&#39;re angry dad this</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.840" end="01:49:17.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.000" end="01:49:20.080" style="s2">um this uh and these</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.280" end="01:49:21.520" style="s2">these uh cracks show up very easily</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.080" end="01:49:23.520" style="s2">because light is difficult and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.520" end="01:49:26.639" style="s2">difficult to be apparent</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.520" end="01:49:31.280" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.639" end="01:49:35.040" style="s2">what a meta-modern religion can do</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.280" end="01:49:38.320" style="s2">is create and again we said it before</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.040" end="01:49:39.599" style="s2">the family also is broken into new</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.320" end="01:49:41.199" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.599" end="01:49:43.360" style="s2">so we have also we have set five new</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.199" end="01:49:46.480" style="s2">forms of family what i didn&#39;t mention</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.360" end="01:49:49.920" style="s2">last time is that we also have</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.480" end="01:49:53.760" style="s2">the metamodernist meta family</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.920" end="01:49:58.159" style="s2">meaning and you said something uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.760" end="01:50:00.719" style="s2">about um a group of 20.</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.159" end="01:50:02.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s more like the meta family</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.719" end="01:50:05.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a new category</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.400" end="01:50:08.320" style="s2">um that people can even</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.920" end="01:50:09.920" style="s2">you know not have a normal family and</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.320" end="01:50:11.440" style="s2">just have the meta family and just be</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.920" end="01:50:13.599" style="s2">friends with people</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.440" end="01:50:15.440" style="s2">who have similar values and correspond</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.599" end="01:50:18.639" style="s2">at the same or or</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.440" end="01:50:19.760" style="s2">or uh code resonate at the same on the</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.639" end="01:50:21.679" style="s2">same frequency</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.760" end="01:50:24.560" style="s2">and then have different strings and so</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.679" end="01:50:27.679" style="s2">on and weaknesses and support each other</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.560" end="01:50:28.480" style="s2">in this political religious professional</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.679" end="01:50:33.840" style="s2">adventure</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.480" end="01:50:33.840" style="s2">which also becomes familial a family</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.880" end="01:50:39.199" style="s2">also becomes family related not least</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.360" end="01:50:42.320" style="s2">when people start having</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.199" end="01:50:44.560" style="s2">well sexual edward and so on</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.320" end="01:50:44.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.920" end="01:50:50.320" style="s2">as these parts are reintegrated</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.040" end="01:50:58.000" style="s2">their emergency category which is</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.159" end="01:51:02.320" style="s2">the meta family and meta modern religion</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.000" end="01:51:06.080" style="s2">and the meta family appear to be</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.320" end="01:51:08.880" style="s2">to appear to be um two two</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.080" end="01:51:09.520" style="s2">sides of the same coin almost and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.880" end="01:51:12.880" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.520" end="01:51:13.520" style="s2">of this metamodel religion is the meta</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.880" end="01:51:17.920" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.520" end="01:51:21.199" style="s2">the meta family um at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.920" end="01:51:23.199" style="s2">needs a glue that is not the old family</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.199" end="01:51:24.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of this world view or</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.199" end="01:51:28.480" style="s2">this faith</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.239" end="01:51:31.440" style="s2">but this faith is so abstract or so and</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.480" end="01:51:31.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s that it can span across all of</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.440" end="01:51:34.159" style="s2">these</p>

<p begin="01:51:39.040" end="01:51:45.760" style="s2">now um then</p>

<p begin="01:51:45.760" end="01:51:53.280" style="s2">and matriarch again playing with</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.840" end="01:51:54.800" style="s2">so supporting those two forces those two</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.280" end="01:51:58.320" style="s2">psychological forces</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.800" end="01:52:00.719" style="s2">which you support by means primarily of</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.320" end="01:52:04.639" style="s2">perspective taking and trauma</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.719" end="01:52:07.440" style="s2">and trauma um addressing trauma</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.639" end="01:52:09.040" style="s2">and which uh chuck is also very</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.440" end="01:52:13.440" style="s2">interested and i see</p>

<p begin="01:52:13.440" end="01:52:17.840" style="s2">you know i just have to say hi man</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.159" end="01:52:25.520" style="s2">and that um he um</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.239" end="01:52:27.760" style="s2">or what we look at there is</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.520" end="01:52:27.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.520" end="01:52:36.560" style="s2">you know creating playful practice of</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.199" end="01:52:38.719" style="s2">patriarchy matriarchy which means</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.560" end="01:52:40.080" style="s2">um brotherhood and sisterhood where we</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.719" end="01:52:44.159" style="s2">support each other to be</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.080" end="01:52:47.280" style="s2">stronger men and and more powerful women</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.159" end="01:52:47.920" style="s2">so this is also a tendency that you see</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.280" end="01:52:49.920" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.920" end="01:52:51.760" style="s2">in the post-feminist space and so on</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.920" end="01:52:53.280" style="s2">people got tired of</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.760" end="01:52:54.880" style="s2">tearing down the genders and now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.280" end="01:52:57.040" style="s2">the manosphere</p>

<p begin="01:53:03.679" end="01:53:08.480" style="s2">masculine and all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.679" end="01:53:10.320" style="s2">these are important elements which need</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.480" end="01:53:13.599" style="s2">to be reconstituted</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.320" end="01:53:15.119" style="s2">in a playful manner within uh within the</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.599" end="01:53:18.960" style="s2">rituals</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.119" end="01:53:22.400" style="s2">uh so yeah there&#39;s a connection there</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.960" end="01:53:24.320" style="s2">quite clearly we see that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.400" end="01:53:25.119" style="s2">strong dialectic we need to play with</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.320" end="01:53:27.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.119" end="01:53:28.639" style="s2">when the place saves space to play with</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.760" end="01:53:30.560" style="s2">it we need</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.639" end="01:53:32.960" style="s2">people who support each other in that</p>

<p begin="01:53:32.960" end="01:53:38.000" style="s2">and for and doing that then</p>
