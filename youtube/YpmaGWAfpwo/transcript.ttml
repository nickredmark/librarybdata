<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:47.550" style="s2">super chat questions that are generated</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">during the Q&amp;A other announcements that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.550" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">we should make oh you want to talk so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">put your patreon e oh yes there has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">some question amongst fans of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">podcast about whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">lectures that I have advertised on</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:06.920" style="s2">patreon lectures is probably the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">word but the monthly discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.920" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">what&#39;s called the coalition of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">reasonable that&#39;s a politically focused</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">discussion and the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">discussion that follows first Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">and Sunday of each month and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:22.439" style="s2">question is are they still running and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">yes they are running they are quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.439" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">popular and exciting and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">having a great time there&#39;s some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">who&#39;ve been participating in those</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">discussions for years now and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">they&#39;re very rewarding I have been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">little reluctant to push them because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">am reluctant about patreon itself after</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">it has demonstrated a desire to censor</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">people so I have not loved using their</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">mechanism that said no good substitute</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:53.729" style="s2">has shown up and so for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re using if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">join those discussions I think you would</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">find them very interesting okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">see where are we I guess here&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">I am wrestling with the fact that never</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">in my wildest imagination did I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">that the thing that was going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:16.260" style="s2">humanity together was</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.099" style="s2">to be the need for a haircut just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">see that coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.099" end="00:02:21.239" style="s2">no that didn&#39;t show up in my accounting</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">either yeah so that raises the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.239" end="00:02:25.349" style="s2">about whether or not we are across an</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:29.340" style="s2">event horizon totally unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.349" end="00:02:31.319" style="s2">cause for global unity has shown up that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.340" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">suggests that nobody&#39;s crystal ball is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.319" end="00:02:34.409" style="s2">all that clear at this moment so in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:37.049" style="s2">case being across the event horizon</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.409" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">means we have gotten to a place where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.049" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">are completely unable to predict what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">will happen next yes we have crossed</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">into a zone that could not have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:47.099" style="s2">predicted from from before so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">that I mean sure that&#39;s tongue-in-cheek</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.099" end="00:02:51.150" style="s2">but at some level it does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:53.099" style="s2">characterize an awful lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">discussions we are having these days I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.099" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">have lots of people telling me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">sure this won&#39;t happen they&#39;re sure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">won&#39;t happen and I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">sure very much about what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:07.829" style="s2">happen because this was just simply not</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">scheduled to happen this way so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.829" end="00:03:13.640" style="s2">specifically talking about what will</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">happen next or ultimately as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.640" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">what do we think is true about the virus</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:25.019" style="s2">and the response to it what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:27.900" style="s2">effective what&#39;s not what what might we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.019" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">be doing to get any better result in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">future those those that second set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:34.019" style="s2">things is not your including in the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:35.489" style="s2">past the event horizon question is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.019" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">right yeah I would say there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.489" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">issues that I consider I had to hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:44.639" style="s2">to say it almost mundane you know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">fact of the corona virus pandemic sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.639" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">there are details of it that are nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.220" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">but surprising but the fact that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:57.150" style="s2">zoonotic disease was going to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">from somewhere that we would the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.150" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">awareness of its power and danger would</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:05.099" style="s2">be too slow for us to react properly we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.849" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">would treat it as a normal phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.099" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">rather than the thing that we had been</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:13.109" style="s2">told to fear so all of that I consider</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:16.889" style="s2">relatively predictable what wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.109" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">predictable from my perspective is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.889" end="00:04:22.260" style="s2">the dynamics that unfold in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">aftermath would look like I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.260" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">example the way it is interacting with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">presidential year here in the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:35.979" style="s2">States and the party politics that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:41.680" style="s2">usually govern that is very surprising</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.979" end="00:04:45.099" style="s2">so we now have a president who is I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.680" end="00:04:47.050" style="s2">would say pretty clearly incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.099" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">doing two things that are needed from</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.050" end="00:04:51.970" style="s2">him at the moment one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">grappling with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:56.229" style="s2">complexities here at a level that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">be necessary to marshal a really proper</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.229" end="00:05:00.599" style="s2">response and the other is he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:03.789" style="s2">seem to be able to put politics aside</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.599" end="00:05:05.849" style="s2">but it sounds like you just said that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.789" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have predicted that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.849" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">really you wouldn&#39;t have predicted that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">from this or many other presidents years</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.440" style="s2">ago I would have predicted that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">potentially for this president although</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.440" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">the thing that surprises me most maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">and maybe I really just have no right to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">be surprised by it but I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:27.340" style="s2">that it should dawn on a Trump that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:31.449" style="s2">has the opportunity to be a hero that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.340" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">the thing he seems to crave about about</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.449" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">adulation and all he could have in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:41.139" style="s2">spades if he could simply adopt a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">mode that we haven&#39;t seen yet and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.139" end="00:05:45.820" style="s2">think it&#39;s just really not in him but</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:48.699" style="s2">what does surprise me is that in light</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.820" end="00:05:53.139" style="s2">of these dynamics that the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.699" end="00:05:56.139" style="s2">Party is not marshalling a credible</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.139" end="00:05:59.580" style="s2">alternative and therefore that we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.139" end="00:06:03.639" style="s2">stuck in a predicament where we have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.580" end="00:06:05.889" style="s2">incredibly feeble Democratic nominee who</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.639" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">obviously is going to be nominated but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.889" end="00:06:10.030" style="s2">say obviously is going to be nominated</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.039" style="s2">and I must say most of me doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.030" end="00:06:13.539" style="s2">believe he&#39;s going to be nominated even</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.039" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">though that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.539" end="00:06:21.130" style="s2">work how he will not be nominated is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:24.699" style="s2">unclear who might step in in lieu of Joe</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.130" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">Biden I think is also unclear because</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.699" end="00:06:29.409" style="s2">obviously Bernie Sanders would be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:30.699" style="s2">obvious choices that runner up but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.409" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">whole reason that we&#39;re stuck with Biden</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.699" end="00:06:34.090" style="s2">is that the Democratic Party really</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:36.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want and I don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.090" end="00:06:37.930" style="s2">Democratic Party like us Democrats I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.010" end="00:06:40.140" style="s2">mean the Democratic Party establishment</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.930" end="00:06:43.080" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t want Bernie sander</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.140" end="00:06:45.420" style="s2">he whatever else he may do he threatens</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.080" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">actual change about things that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:52.620" style="s2">I&#39;m a little surprised that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.700" end="00:06:54.390" style="s2">surprised that you&#39;re disappointed in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.620" end="00:06:57.780" style="s2">the Democratic National Committee at</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.390" end="00:07:01.590" style="s2">this point having been you know we lived</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.780" end="00:07:05.640" style="s2">together through the 2016 election in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">which you were often apoplectic at what</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.640" end="00:07:13.110" style="s2">the Democratic Party was doing as was i</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.830" end="00:07:14.370" style="s2">but I think before this became the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.110" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">global pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.370" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">and global governmental response that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">is both you and I had looked with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:27.810" style="s2">astonishment at the winnowing of a once</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:31.080" style="s2">incredibly large like stupidly large</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.810" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">field of potential candidates in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.080" end="00:07:34.680" style="s2">Democratic field and thought about many</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">of them no no way</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.680" end="00:07:40.230" style="s2">no thank you and thought about a few of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:42.780" style="s2">them a very few of them oh hey that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.230" end="00:07:44.940" style="s2">might work and watch does it winnowed</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:48.210" style="s2">and winnow tin winnowed and the heir</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.940" end="00:07:51.390" style="s2">apparent became the same ol same ol this</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.210" end="00:07:53.670" style="s2">all happened before you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.390" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">point that probably we should have</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.670" end="00:07:58.830" style="s2">already been having responses at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:01.830" style="s2">federal level within this country but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.830" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t so the fact that there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.830" end="00:08:06.150" style="s2">seem to be any change now</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:09.690" style="s2">within the Democratic National Committee</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.150" end="00:08:11.970" style="s2">the DNC in terms of its response it</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.690" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t surprise me maybe I&#39;m maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.970" end="00:08:16.140" style="s2">done being surprised well you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">you&#39;re right well how what right do I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.140" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">have to be surprised as the guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.820" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">usually pointing out that a we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">options we don&#39;t register and that be</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">the system is unsalvageable as it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:29.880" style="s2">that we have to take drastic action so</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:31.890" style="s2">at some level I guess part of me can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.880" end="00:08:38.520" style="s2">be surprised but yeah well I think what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.890" end="00:08:41.910" style="s2">stuns me is that I see nothing creative</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.520" end="00:08:46.590" style="s2">in the Democrats response here I see</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">nothing new I see I see a test in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.590" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">midst of kovat 19 I see a test of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:53.270" style="s2">hypothesis that the problem with Hillary</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:57.580" style="s2">Clinton was the pantsuit</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.270" end="00:09:00.050" style="s2">I see a male Hillary Clinton who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.580" end="00:09:01.790" style="s2">mentally what do you say that again</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.050" end="00:09:04.040" style="s2">that&#39;s very hard to parse well I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.790" end="00:09:05.780" style="s2">it&#39;s a preposterous if you thought that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.040" end="00:09:07.550" style="s2">Hillary Clinton just I&#39;m not even sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.780" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">that the words made sense in that order</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.550" end="00:09:10.790" style="s2">I think they did but would you say it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:15.650" style="s2">again sure if you thought that Hillary</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.790" end="00:09:18.650" style="s2">Clinton was the right candidate but 4x</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.650" end="00:09:21.260" style="s2">and X was up America wasn&#39;t ready for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.650" end="00:09:23.000" style="s2">pantsuit right then you might try you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.260" end="00:09:25.370" style="s2">just saying that this code for a female</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.000" end="00:09:27.280" style="s2">president isn&#39;t oh I&#39;m saying if you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.370" end="00:09:29.840" style="s2">some dumb idea that it was some</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.280" end="00:09:31.640" style="s2">triviality about the scenario and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.840" end="00:09:34.970" style="s2">you wanted to do was run the identical</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.640" end="00:09:37.460" style="s2">scenario with against an incumbent this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.970" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">time and with the one little arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.460" end="00:09:41.000" style="s2">thing changed that you had imagined it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.770" end="00:09:43.400" style="s2">caused the problem in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.000" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">rather than recognizing that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.400" end="00:09:48.020" style="s2">else may be true Hillary Clinton may</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">have won the popular vote but she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.020" end="00:09:52.400" style="s2">slam dunk it a lot of people really</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:09:53.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to vote for Hillary Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.400" end="00:09:56.450" style="s2">and so the point is the problem was</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.840" end="00:09:58.630" style="s2">never the pantsuit or anything arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.450" end="00:10:01.580" style="s2">the problem was that this was the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.630" end="00:10:03.500" style="s2">DNC nonsense that people were fed up</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.580" end="00:10:07.640" style="s2">with and so they&#39;re gonna try that again</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.500" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">in 2020 I believe we are basically in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.640" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">the same class but I&#39;m gonna push back</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:13.640" style="s2">against the idea that the pantsuit is</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:16.310" style="s2">the difference between Biden and Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.640" end="00:10:17.750" style="s2">I didn&#39;t by then and I don&#39;t buy now you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.310" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">know I didn&#39;t buy them that it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.750" end="00:10:22.310" style="s2">widespread misogyny that kept Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:24.080" style="s2">from the presidency and I don&#39;t buy now</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.310" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">that widespread misogyny is what kept</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.080" end="00:10:31.300" style="s2">Elizabeth Warren who until she went woke</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:34.550" style="s2">I thought was a pretty awesome candidate</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.300" end="00:10:36.890" style="s2">but the fact is that there are there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.550" end="00:10:39.830" style="s2">one large difference at least between</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.890" end="00:10:43.520" style="s2">Clinton and Biden and if you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.830" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">not just the fancy not the dementia well</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.520" end="00:10:48.200" style="s2">so yeah obviously she&#39;s she&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:49.940" style="s2">competent still yes she and maybe she</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.200" end="00:10:51.260" style="s2">wasn&#39;t then but at this point she&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.940" end="00:10:54.980" style="s2">confident because she doesn&#39;t have scars</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.260" end="00:10:56.960" style="s2">we know have any dementia and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.980" end="00:10:58.670" style="s2">certainly there are a few people and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.960" end="00:11:02.300" style="s2">honestly don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fraction</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:03.590" style="s2">of 1% or 10% of the population of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.300" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">country who wouldn&#39;t vote for a woman</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.590" end="00:11:07.150" style="s2">for president but I&#39;d be shocked it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">more than 10%</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.150" end="00:11:12.070" style="s2">this point you know I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:13.630" style="s2">this is a credible idea I&#39;m saying what</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.070" end="00:11:16.210" style="s2">I&#39;m watching is a Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.630" end="00:11:18.700" style="s2">engaged in a live-fire exercise where</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.210" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">they test a wrong hypothesis about why</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.700" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">Hillary Clinton was not elected and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:27.370" style="s2">test it by running a version of the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">politics dressed up differently I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.370" end="00:11:30.610" style="s2">care that she&#39;s a woman I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">most people care that Hillary Clinton is</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:35.110" style="s2">a woman I think what we care about if</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:37.900" style="s2">she represents the same thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.110" end="00:11:38.530" style="s2">been parasitizing us for just over a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.900" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">decade</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.530" end="00:11:43.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t that in fact exactly what then is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:45.700" style="s2">being revealed the Democratic National</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.720" end="00:11:49.390" style="s2">Committee cares about as well like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.700" end="00:11:52.180" style="s2">that the status quo the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.390" end="00:11:53.530" style="s2">politician is what they want to push on</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.180" end="00:11:56.380" style="s2">us no matter what that&#39;s what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.530" end="00:11:59.170" style="s2">revealed well what they want is no</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.380" end="00:12:00.850" style="s2">meaningful change the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.170" end="00:12:04.030" style="s2">that is quite at the point that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.850" end="00:12:10.350" style="s2">abandoned the working class and embraced</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.030" end="00:12:13.090" style="s2">a certain cadre of rent-seeking elites</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.350" end="00:12:15.730" style="s2">basically became hostile to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.090" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">change and in order to explain why we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.730" end="00:12:19.210" style="s2">should elect them if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.140" end="00:12:21.730" style="s2">interested in change they&#39;ve given us a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.210" end="00:12:23.740" style="s2">lot of symbolism hence the the woke</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.730" end="00:12:29.530" style="s2">nightmare that we have seen sweep over</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.740" end="00:12:32.650" style="s2">much of the left but still I would have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.530" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">imagined no matter how dumb and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.650" end="00:12:36.940" style="s2">delusional the DNC may be I would have</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:39.790" style="s2">thought they would have learned more</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.940" end="00:12:45.160" style="s2">from 2016 than they apparently learned</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.790" end="00:12:47.470" style="s2">and to find Joe Biden who is I think it</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:51.840" style="s2">would be impossible to be enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.470" end="00:12:54.250" style="s2">about this candidacy to find him as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.840" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2">offering that we are being delivered in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.250" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">the midst yeah okay this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.350" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t you know most of the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:04.090" style="s2">primary did not unfold with our</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:06.640" style="s2">awareness of Kovan 19 but nonetheless it</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.090" end="00:13:09.480" style="s2">is a stunning moment to see our</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.640" end="00:13:13.030" style="s2">political structure declare itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.480" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">incapable of finding a good president</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.030" end="00:13:18.730" style="s2">right it has declared that on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:19.960" style="s2">in in my opinion and what I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.730" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">we can get back to the event horizon</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.960" end="00:13:24.790" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:27.910" style="s2">is that okay if both sides have</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.790" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">delivered you an answer that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.910" end="00:13:33.910" style="s2">unacceptable and then the world has</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:36.009" style="s2">delivered you a crisis that reveals how</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.910" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">dangerous it is to have somebody in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.009" end="00:13:42.519" style="s2">office who is not up to the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:44.559" style="s2">then it seems to me this is the moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.519" end="00:13:47.109" style="s2">at which we get to ask the question well</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.559" end="00:13:51.299" style="s2">what possibilities that have seemed</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.109" end="00:13:51.299" style="s2">impossible are now back on the table</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.169" end="00:14:00.489" style="s2">what are you proposing well I&#39;ll go back</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.049" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">to proposing mutiny which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.489" end="00:14:10.149" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what opportunities we</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:13.029" style="s2">actually have but I will say the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.149" end="00:14:15.549" style="s2">democratic party may not be salvageable</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.029" end="00:14:18.699" style="s2">by virtue of the stranglehold on power</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.549" end="00:14:21.339" style="s2">that the DNC appears to hold over it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.699" end="00:14:26.049" style="s2">so there&#39;s a question about well if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.339" end="00:14:28.360" style="s2">needed to storm the cockpit what other</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.049" end="00:14:30.459" style="s2">mechanisms exist right is there</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.360" end="00:14:34.319" style="s2">something that can be done and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.459" end="00:14:37.089" style="s2">think this is the place to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.319" end="00:14:38.470" style="s2">explore that question but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.089" end="00:14:40.029" style="s2">question needs to be on the table</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">because I think an awful lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.029" end="00:14:47.350" style="s2">who are experiencing lockdown at home</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:50.769" style="s2">will recognize that the system has</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.350" end="00:14:53.410" style="s2">failed them and that every four years we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.769" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">get a chance to alter how it functions</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.410" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">at a significant level well it could</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:58.660" style="s2">instead though I mean I&#39;m prepared to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.790" style="s2">all sorts of different things than this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.660" end="00:15:02.769" style="s2">and I&#39;m not prepared to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.790" end="00:15:03.939" style="s2">question that you just launched you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.769" end="00:15:05.889" style="s2">what is it that we do if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.939" end="00:15:07.509" style="s2">storm the cockpit because it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.889" end="00:15:09.789" style="s2">to me that that&#39;s where we are and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.509" end="00:15:12.759" style="s2">we should be doing so it feels a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.789" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">bit like a setup but one way to approach</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.759" end="00:15:17.529" style="s2">this where it doesn&#39;t feel like a setup</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:22.269" style="s2">is to say okay if this is all very</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.529" end="00:15:25.720" style="s2">standard sort of game theoretic outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.269" end="00:15:29.289" style="s2">from a two-party system that has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.720" end="00:15:31.370" style="s2">more and more cemented in place over the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.289" end="00:15:36.470" style="s2">course of decades</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.370" end="00:15:38.630" style="s2">by some measures centuries and you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.470" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">call that as you have and has others</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.630" end="00:15:43.070" style="s2">have game a maybe we should be talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:45.350" style="s2">about what it would mean to move into a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:49.190" style="s2">game be universe maybe maybe that is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.350" end="00:15:51.740" style="s2">setup that you are actually bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.190" end="00:15:53.510" style="s2">us here well I think so</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.740" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">but I think you know for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.510" end="00:15:58.400" style="s2">who are not aware of what game B means</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:00.020" style="s2">game that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.400" end="00:16:02.570" style="s2">trying to set you up to describe because</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.020" end="00:16:05.779" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that a totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.570" end="00:16:08.690" style="s2">abstract store in the cockpit is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.779" end="00:16:10.190" style="s2">going to result in much further</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.690" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">discussion right here in fact you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.190" end="00:16:14.779" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I want to continue that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:17.980" style="s2">you know what what then what might we do</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.779" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">well how might we understand this as</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.980" end="00:16:24.080" style="s2">okay maybe beyond their event horizon</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:25.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to predict now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.080" end="00:16:28.600" style="s2">gonna happen next</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.160" end="00:16:30.920" style="s2">even on questions where it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.600" end="00:16:32.960" style="s2">don&#39;t we have enough information no we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.920" end="00:16:35.750" style="s2">actually we seem to not because things</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.960" end="00:16:39.350" style="s2">are changing so fast so how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.750" end="00:16:42.350" style="s2">this very modern predicament of change</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.350" end="00:16:45.200" style="s2">that is so fast that the future will not</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.350" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">look like the past how can we take that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.200" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">situation and understand it in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:53.060" style="s2">context of if game a is how things have</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:54.140" style="s2">always been done how might we do things</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.060" end="00:16:58.640" style="s2">in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.140" end="00:17:01.160" style="s2">well one thing to say is that we we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.640" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">handed a system that has a structure</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.160" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">written into the Constitution and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:08.150" style="s2">we are handed a system that functions</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:11.449" style="s2">within it which is the parties which</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.150" end="00:17:13.010" style="s2">hold on to power and they allocate it in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.449" end="00:17:16.370" style="s2">various ways and they make sure not to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.010" end="00:17:20.390" style="s2">lose it in other ways and the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.370" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">really is in light of the constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.390" end="00:17:24.770" style="s2">structure that we have do we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">opportunities if we recognize that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.770" end="00:17:33.920" style="s2">parties are not the route to good</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.850" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">governance so game B for what it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.920" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">is the idea that within the system there</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:43.700" style="s2">are mechanisms that could create</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">desirable change could increase the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.700" end="00:17:46.909" style="s2">stability the antifragility</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:51.070" style="s2">of the system the fairness of the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.909" end="00:17:53.630" style="s2">that do not require something like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.070" end="00:17:57.880" style="s2">taking a part of the constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.630" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">structure so I would say in fact really</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.880" end="00:18:05.419" style="s2">there&#39;s no advocacy for that right that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:07.220" style="s2">the you know the extent the outline of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.419" end="00:18:10.190" style="s2">the constitutional structure in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">country remains what it has always been</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.190" end="00:18:16.909" style="s2">which was farsighted and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">simultaneously honouring of what has</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.909" end="00:18:23.630" style="s2">worked in the past and open to novelty</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:27.399" style="s2">moving forward in terms of solution</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.630" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">making well yeah I certainly I would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.399" end="00:18:33.529" style="s2">you know the Constitution the matically</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:35.269" style="s2">is right I would say like any document</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.529" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">that was written when it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.269" end="00:18:40.279" style="s2">incapable of handling many of the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">century realities so you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.279" end="00:18:45.860" style="s2">think we should treat it as sacred</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:47.630" style="s2">though I do think that in terms of a the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.860" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">founders would have had a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.630" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">doing better given what they understood</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:54.860" style="s2">and be in light of the values that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">enshrined in it I don&#39;t think we should</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.860" end="00:19:00.289" style="s2">be eager to open it up but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">beyond that I would be afraid to see it</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.289" end="00:19:05.809" style="s2">opened up because I think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.519" style="s2">political disaster and we would end up</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.809" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">making the Constitution far worse so</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.519" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">anyway if you take that or some position</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:14.630" style="s2">like it as correct then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">well what can we do within the structure</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.630" end="00:19:22.549" style="s2">that would usher in the proper style of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:26.389" style="s2">changes without an alteration to the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.549" end="00:19:28.070" style="s2">underlying foundation and the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.389" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">place I mean I guess what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.070" end="00:19:34.669" style="s2">look it&#39;s 2020 we have an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:36.740" style="s2">upcoming that opportunity isn&#39;t as big</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.669" end="00:19:41.500" style="s2">as it might be because the primary</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.740" end="00:19:45.260" style="s2">season has already run its course but</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.500" end="00:19:47.269" style="s2">there may be an opportunity if Biden is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.260" end="00:19:49.460" style="s2">not viable by virtue of the accusations</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.269" end="00:19:51.169" style="s2">that have been brought against him then</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.460" end="00:19:53.090" style="s2">what happens next I&#39;m not sure I know</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.169" end="00:19:55.610" style="s2">buddy and I know anybody who knows the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.090" end="00:19:58.220" style="s2">answer to that question so again it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.610" end="00:19:58.710" style="s2">event horizon of some kind yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.220" end="00:20:03.330" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.710" end="00:20:07.350" style="s2">the remarkable convergence of global</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.799" end="00:20:29.669" style="s2">next I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.809" end="00:20:31.830" style="s2">yeah haven&#39;t seen it exactly so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.669" end="00:20:33.990" style="s2">really all I&#39;m saying is let us at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.830" end="00:20:36.450" style="s2">recognize that we&#39;re in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.990" end="00:20:38.370" style="s2">right and therefore all sorts of things</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:56.139" style="s2">is that it is not a political phenomenon</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.230" end="00:27:32.350" style="s2">in this case we have a a question that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.740" end="00:27:34.210" style="s2">we have to ask ourselves so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.350" end="00:27:36.970" style="s2">watching for example these protesters</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.210" end="00:27:39.519" style="s2">who are demanding that we remove the</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.940" end="00:27:51.129" style="s2">making an argument about the comparison</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.620" end="00:27:59.769" style="s2">if we lift it now some of them are in</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.399" end="00:28:02.379" style="s2">denial about whether there is a hazard</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.769" end="00:28:05.580" style="s2">to begin with but if we put those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.379" end="00:28:08.049" style="s2">aside there is a calculation to be made</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.580" end="00:28:10.809" style="s2">obviously we do these calculations all</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.049" end="00:28:13.720" style="s2">the time you want to eliminate all</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.809" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">highway deaths that&#39;s easy you just end</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.009" end="00:29:52.529" style="s2">the problem is that we politeness keeps</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.639" end="00:29:55.169" style="s2">us from having the discussions that we</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.740" end="00:30:13.769" style="s2">that&#39;s very unfortunate and it may be an</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.550" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">to the American context for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.350" end="00:32:19.830" style="s2">we have to look at ourselves and we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">to say are we the sort of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.830" end="00:32:23.640" style="s2">going to recognize that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:28.170" style="s2">category of folks who are very</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.170" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">those but that&#39;s okay or are we not are</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.770" end="00:32:35.490" style="s2">we going to say that in this case</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:37.800" style="s2">actually those people ended up unlucky</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.490" end="00:32:39.750" style="s2">they ended up in a in a vulnerable</p>

<p begin="00:32:51.780" end="00:32:58.020" style="s2">this is I think where I come out which</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.210" end="00:33:01.470" style="s2">is that this is not a calculation of how</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.020" end="00:33:03.240" style="s2">many deaths is acceptable not to wreck</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.680" style="s2">a normal life</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.460" end="00:35:36.810" style="s2">you do start getting into questions</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.950" end="00:35:49.950" style="s2">right there is a lot of our system that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.099" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">simply reinforces patterns of well-being</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.950" end="00:35:54.450" style="s2">that already exist which means we&#39;ve got</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.450" end="00:36:00.150" style="s2">so arbitrary patterns from the past that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.670" end="00:36:02.070" style="s2">do continue forward and we could for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.150" end="00:36:04.050" style="s2">same reasons that I would argue we</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.070" end="00:36:06.109" style="s2">should not throw vulnerable people under</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.050" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">the bus to Cove at 19 that we actually</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.480" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">spend to protect them that same question</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.810" end="00:36:27.150" style="s2">right when in fact the reasons that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.359" end="00:36:29.339" style="s2">is you know what the reason that it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.150" end="00:36:30.690" style="s2">vulnerable have to do with decisions</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.339" end="00:36:36.030" style="s2">that it didn&#39;t have any part in either</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.690" end="00:36:39.180" style="s2">so I do think it would be marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.030" end="00:36:42.330" style="s2">if this moment got us to sideline our</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.180" end="00:36:44.250" style="s2">politics enough that we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.330" end="00:36:47.970" style="s2">courageous discussion about those</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.250" end="00:36:51.900" style="s2">questions and you know as I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.970" end="00:36:54.930" style="s2">elsewhere luck is really the enemy right</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.900" end="00:36:57.900" style="s2">good and bad luck are noise when it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.930" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">comes to the things to create well-being</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.900" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">a fair system minimizes the role of luck</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:05.010" style="s2">and outcomes yeah this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:06.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve said in the past and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.010" end="00:37:08.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you said it exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.180" end="00:37:10.170" style="s2">way but that&#39;s that&#39;s how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.280" end="00:37:11.820" style="s2">internalized it a fair system minimizes</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.170" end="00:37:13.770" style="s2">the role of luck in the outcomes of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.820" end="00:37:18.630" style="s2">people such that they are maximally free</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.770" end="00:37:20.460" style="s2">to produce to create to live to the best</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.630" end="00:37:23.400" style="s2">of their abilities and desires yep and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">then that actually be by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.400" end="00:37:27.690" style="s2">fact that it eliminates noise it creates</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:29.220" style="s2">signal that guides you tells you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.690" end="00:37:30.900" style="s2">actually worth doing because you get</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.220" end="00:37:32.820" style="s2">rewarded for things that actually create</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.900" end="00:37:35.339" style="s2">good in the world so we want a system</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.820" end="00:37:38.089" style="s2">that has positive feedback motivational</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.339" end="00:37:41.310" style="s2">structures built-in yeah rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.089" end="00:37:44.220" style="s2">series of negative feedback motivational</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.310" end="00:37:46.380" style="s2">structures that start at kindergarten</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.820" end="00:37:51.360" style="s2">not beyond given at least in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.100" end="00:37:54.410" style="s2">that people continue to have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.360" end="00:37:55.800" style="s2">with things like Medicare and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.410" end="00:37:58.980" style="s2">retirement plans</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">yeah beyond that absolutely yeah</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.050" end="00:42:50.870" style="s2">market it&#39;s not very well traveled um</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.190" end="00:42:57.500" style="s2">but anyway I was checking out and I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.870" end="00:43:00.320" style="s2">being my usual ironic self and because</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.500" end="00:43:02.390" style="s2">my face was covered the guy was talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.320" end="00:43:04.910" style="s2">to who it turned out later in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.390" end="00:43:08.150" style="s2">conversation was very much up for having</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.910" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">a kind of you know dialogue that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.150" end="00:43:12.580" style="s2">involve wit and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:15.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tell that I was kidding and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.580" end="00:43:17.360" style="s2">anyway it kind of made the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.350" end="00:43:19.160" style="s2">very awkward at first and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.360" end="00:43:21.830" style="s2">I guess maybe I&#39;m just learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:24.020" style="s2">engage in that behavior with the with</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.830" end="00:43:26.840" style="s2">the mask but well this is actually I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.020" end="00:43:30.770" style="s2">think perfectly analogous to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.840" end="00:43:32.990" style="s2">problems with with social media that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.770" end="00:43:35.060" style="s2">were reduced it seems like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.990" end="00:43:36.470" style="s2">writing but it&#39;s more like we&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.060" end="00:43:39.110" style="s2">sort of and this has been argued by</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.470" end="00:43:40.700" style="s2">scholars of language that we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.110" end="00:43:43.370" style="s2">returning to something that&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.700" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">an oral culture and we mostly are</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.370" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">playing don&#39;t know how to play the rule</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:48.140" style="s2">play by the rules and so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:50.990" style="s2">think that you&#39;ve run afoul of this a</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:54.950" style="s2">few times with regard to you have a code</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.990" end="00:43:56.600" style="s2">right you know just stop me or correct</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.950" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">me if I get this wrong but as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.600" end="00:44:01.670" style="s2">understand it now you have a code and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.390" end="00:44:03.650" style="s2">it&#39;s that if you use an emoji it means</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.670" end="00:44:05.030" style="s2">you&#39;re being sarcastic or ironic or</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.650" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">otherwise saying something that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.030" end="00:44:07.880" style="s2">really really don&#39;t mean and so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.310" style="s2">should be read that way right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.880" end="00:44:12.050" style="s2">effectively it&#39;s it&#39;s the you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.310" end="00:44:14.090" style="s2">can do it with your facial expressions</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.050" end="00:44:15.950" style="s2">although you also do a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.090" end="00:44:17.260" style="s2">keeping a straight face so that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.950" end="00:44:21.350" style="s2">could lead people down a primrose path</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.260" end="00:44:25.400" style="s2">Walker in person but you know in a tweet</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.350" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">for instance I now know that when I see</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.400" end="00:44:28.410" style="s2">an emoji associated</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:29.700" style="s2">something that you&#39;ve written that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.410" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it I might also know what</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.700" end="00:44:35.099" style="s2">your positions are for the most part but</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.470" end="00:44:36.779" style="s2">I think that today for instance you I</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.099" end="00:44:39.089" style="s2">don&#39;t remember even what you said but</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.779" end="00:44:42.210" style="s2">you but you put a radio or something put</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.089" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">a radio emoji next to it I thought no</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.210" end="00:44:47.099" style="s2">one is gonna get this yes I said free</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:49.859" style="s2">speech doesn&#39;t mean you can just say</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.099" end="00:44:52.650" style="s2">whatever you want right which I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.859" end="00:44:54.690" style="s2">the words in and of themselves can note</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.650" end="00:44:57.420" style="s2">irony either you&#39;re an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.690" end="00:44:59.009" style="s2">or they can note irony but I what I find</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:01.259" style="s2">on Twitter is again and again when I say</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.009" end="00:45:03.809" style="s2">something like that which I feel is so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.259" end="00:45:05.069" style="s2">over-the-top that everybody will have</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.809" end="00:45:06.599" style="s2">two hundred I mean maybe it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.069" end="00:45:08.009" style="s2">their first thought but their second</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.599" end="00:45:11.220" style="s2">thought will be maybe he&#39;s kidding I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.009" end="00:45:12.900" style="s2">guess middle it&#39;s so in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.220" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">what some of what many people think I</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.900" end="00:45:18.180" style="s2">know that&#39;s the beauty right but so</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:19.950" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s over the top yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.180" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">and but you also recognize that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.950" end="00:45:24.299" style="s2">beauty of it as you say is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:27.509" style="s2">smack dab in the middle of the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.299" end="00:45:28.109" style="s2">that says it&#39;s not exactly cause for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.509" end="00:45:31.019" style="s2">celebration</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.109" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">that more men are dying than women right</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.019" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">so that ideology people who buy into</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:41.609" style="s2">that ideology would absolutely say the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:44.970" style="s2">thing that you said and it&#39;s it requires</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.609" end="00:45:46.230" style="s2">it requires eyebrows it requires facial</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.970" end="00:45:48.210" style="s2">structure requires that you be</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.789" end="00:45:54.989" style="s2">that your audience knows first time that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.130" end="00:45:56.519" style="s2">that was actually not what you really</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.989" end="00:45:58.380" style="s2">believe in your heart of hearts well I</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.519" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know see I mean I guess the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.380" end="00:46:04.049" style="s2">problem is you know for me this is sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:06.450" style="s2">of where humor is it&#39;s you know it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.450" end="00:46:11.220" style="s2">mean that you know it&#39;s a somber thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.190" end="00:46:13.980" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously tremendous fun but what I</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.220" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">want is for people who resonate with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.980" end="00:46:17.819" style="s2">idea that you know free speech doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:22.259" style="s2">mean you can say whatever you want I</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.819" end="00:46:24.630" style="s2">want them to say yeah and then say wait</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.259" end="00:46:25.380" style="s2">what what did I just say that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.630" end="00:46:28.499" style="s2">make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.380" end="00:46:31.410" style="s2">you know so anyway we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost this</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.499" end="00:46:33.390" style="s2">in part text isn&#39;t great at this</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.410" end="00:46:36.239" style="s2">especially you know as you&#39;ve pointed</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.390" end="00:46:38.460" style="s2">out in our classes where we knew our</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.239" end="00:46:40.020" style="s2">students really really well you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.460" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">use irony</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:45.870" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve pointed to the setting</p>

<p begin="00:46:45.870" end="00:46:49.620" style="s2">you&#39;re talking do you know who you talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.250" end="00:46:51.270" style="s2">to exactly so you you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.620" end="00:46:54.990" style="s2">thing that I used to do all the time</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.270" end="00:46:56.780" style="s2">with students where if students if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.990" end="00:46:59.640" style="s2">were on a field trip let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.780" end="00:47:00.840" style="s2">students were goofing off and they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.640" end="00:47:03.030" style="s2">sitting you know I saw a group of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.840" end="00:47:04.940" style="s2">students at a table you know laughing it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.030" end="00:47:07.650" style="s2">up I would walk over and in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.940" end="00:47:10.590" style="s2">serious tone of voice with no expression</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.650" end="00:47:13.890" style="s2">on my face I&#39;d say guys if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.590" end="00:47:17.520" style="s2">laughing you&#39;re not learning and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.890" end="00:47:19.770" style="s2">table would go deadly and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.520" end="00:47:21.630" style="s2">the first person at the table to get the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.770" end="00:47:24.390" style="s2">joke would be like wait a minute what</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.630" end="00:47:26.070" style="s2">are you saying and then you know and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.390" end="00:47:28.920" style="s2">then it sort of dawns I mean I actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.070" end="00:47:30.210" style="s2">believe almost exactly the opposite if</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.920" end="00:47:31.890" style="s2">you&#39;re laughing you probably are</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.210" end="00:47:34.200" style="s2">learning also if you&#39;re crying it works</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.890" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">either way but the point is these if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.200" end="00:47:39.360" style="s2">did not however ever aim to nor I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:43.530" style="s2">really ever actually make students cry</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.360" end="00:47:45.330" style="s2">it probably has a voice but but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.530" end="00:47:47.220" style="s2">yeah so anyway these things are if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.330" end="00:47:49.860" style="s2">do know the person really well then it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.220" end="00:47:51.120" style="s2">works out on Twitter we all only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.860" end="00:47:53.370" style="s2">know each other and so it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.120" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">out at all so yes I&#39;ve resorted to if</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.370" end="00:47:57.180" style="s2">there&#39;s an emoji then this is not to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:48:01.380" style="s2">taken at face value whoops</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.180" end="00:48:03.510" style="s2">in this case it&#39;s gonna continue asking</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.380" end="00:48:06.030" style="s2">about this what&#39;s with the radio emoji</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.510" end="00:48:07.860" style="s2">how does that possibly be so I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.030" end="00:48:10.440" style="s2">just like I mean just kind of looks like</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.860" end="00:48:13.380" style="s2">you hit a random button before hitting</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.440" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">send no first of all I do not commit</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.380" end="00:48:18.270" style="s2">myself that the emoji will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">content-rich though I always look for</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.270" end="00:48:22.230" style="s2">one that is instead of pronouns and your</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:24.930" style="s2">buyer you need this if emoji then</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.230" end="00:48:27.210" style="s2">sarcasm sarcasm right but the radio</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.930" end="00:48:31.170" style="s2">actually was chosen because the thing I</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.210" end="00:48:34.140" style="s2">was responding to was Jay Shapiro asking</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.170" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">the question in earnest I think about if</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.140" end="00:48:39.270" style="s2">Alex Jones has been evicted from all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:44.370" style="s2">these platforms does he have free speech</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.270" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">and so anyway radio seemed relevant but</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.370" end="00:48:50.100" style="s2">you know kind of all right you got to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:53.810" style="s2">work with me a little bit on the emoji</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.100" end="00:48:56.340" style="s2">thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.810" end="00:48:58.140" style="s2">okay I think we&#39;re done picking</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.340" end="00:48:59.820" style="s2">ridiculous examples from the right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.140" end="00:49:03.540" style="s2">the left with regard to how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.820" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">responding to this crisis you won&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.540" end="00:49:12.290" style="s2">a little bit about the varying responses</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:15.000" style="s2">to well I guess the good segue here is</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.290" end="00:49:17.340" style="s2">people are becoming politicized over</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.000" end="00:49:19.590" style="s2">lockdown versus no lockdown which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.340" end="00:49:21.390" style="s2">once again a false choice it&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.590" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">dichotomy there&#39;s it shouldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.390" end="00:49:27.690" style="s2">binary because many governments clearly</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.210" style="s2">as we talked about a little bit last</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.690" end="00:49:33.290" style="s2">time the numbers are showing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.210" end="00:49:37.470" style="s2">lockdowns are effective in reducing</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.290" end="00:49:39.870" style="s2">deaths but there is also a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.470" end="00:49:41.430" style="s2">a conversation important conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.870" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2">be had with regard to what are the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.430" end="00:49:46.490" style="s2">effects and therefore what number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.050" end="00:49:49.290" style="s2">deaths are we willing to put up with etc</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.490" end="00:49:51.870" style="s2">but I think frankly for me the more</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.290" end="00:49:52.980" style="s2">interesting question is not lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.870" end="00:49:55.740" style="s2">versus not lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.980" end="00:49:58.980" style="s2">but what kind of lockdowns what what</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.740" end="00:50:01.560" style="s2">kinds of injunctions are coming down</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.980" end="00:50:05.940" style="s2">from governments be they city state</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.560" end="00:50:09.180" style="s2">province national that at some point</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.940" end="00:50:10.680" style="s2">those who are most firmly behind the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.180" end="00:50:12.600" style="s2">idea of lockdowns who really understand</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.680" end="00:50:15.390" style="s2">why masks matter why social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.600" end="00:50:16.910" style="s2">matters all of this are going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.390" end="00:50:20.010" style="s2">are going to start breaking rules</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.910" end="00:50:23.070" style="s2">because many of the roles that are being</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.010" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">handed down to us are ridiculous and bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.070" end="00:50:26.970" style="s2">and are not based on a sell</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:27.900" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on so just</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.970" end="00:50:29.640" style="s2">a few examples</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.900" end="00:50:32.910" style="s2">I mean we&#39;ve we&#39;ve already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.640" end="00:50:35.220" style="s2">this but it looked for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.910" end="00:50:37.560" style="s2">last week before what was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.220" end="00:50:40.410" style="s2">our last livestream and sorry guys</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.560" end="00:50:42.420" style="s2">technical troubles stop that but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.410" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">looked like governor Newsom in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.420" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">California was going to shut down all</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:51.150" style="s2">parks and beaches across the state which</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:53.490" style="s2">is ridiculous right it&#39;s an totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.150" end="00:50:55.080" style="s2">ridiculous response turns out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.490" end="00:50:56.550" style="s2">know if he really was or he wasn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.080" end="00:51:01.290" style="s2">he got so much pushback before it ever</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.550" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">happened that actually was just just the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.290" end="00:51:05.400" style="s2">Orange County beaches which is in Orange</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:06.550" style="s2">County for those not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.400" end="00:51:07.690" style="s2">California is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.550" end="00:51:09.790" style="s2">giant County in Southern California</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.690" end="00:51:11.050" style="s2">basically between LA and San Diego I</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.790" end="00:51:12.820" style="s2">think right it&#39;s the it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.050" end="00:51:16.840" style="s2">coastal county between LA County and San</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.820" end="00:51:18.220" style="s2">Diego County and you know frankly it</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.840" end="00:51:21.460" style="s2">also feels a little bit like a political</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.220" end="00:51:23.500" style="s2">move because la is pretty blue and San</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.460" end="00:51:25.990" style="s2">Diego is pretty blue aside from maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.500" end="00:51:28.270" style="s2">the military bases and Orange County is</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.990" end="00:51:30.790" style="s2">pretty red all right it&#39;s it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.270" end="00:51:34.020" style="s2">the coastal California counties in you</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.790" end="00:51:37.960" style="s2">know that&#39;s south of Golden Gate Bridge</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.020" end="00:51:40.260" style="s2">that runs Republican so it may be felt a</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.960" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">little personal a little political and</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.260" end="00:51:46.360" style="s2">well what do you know what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:47.890" style="s2">well first of all I want to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.360" end="00:51:50.860" style="s2">dovetails a lot with what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.890" end="00:51:52.780" style="s2">thinking about over the last week and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.860" end="00:51:56.620" style="s2">want to put a little amplifier on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.780" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">point it&#39;s not ridiculous it&#39;s isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.620" end="00:52:05.100" style="s2">ridiculous the shutting down of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.740" end="00:52:08.170" style="s2">public parks yeah it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.100" end="00:52:10.030" style="s2">dangerous and it is making the exact</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.170" end="00:52:13.660" style="s2">problem that it is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.030" end="00:52:14.860" style="s2">solving worse and here&#39;s I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.660" end="00:52:16.630" style="s2">careful about this because I think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.860" end="00:52:18.340" style="s2">now have enough information to say that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.630" end="00:52:21.010" style="s2">with some certainty but the point is if</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.340" end="00:52:22.270" style="s2">it&#39;s true it was true before we had the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.010" end="00:52:25.180" style="s2">information to say that was some</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.270" end="00:52:26.770" style="s2">certainty yeah and so the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.180" end="00:52:28.660" style="s2">thinking of in particular with you and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.770" end="00:52:32.290" style="s2">have discussed extensively on and off</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.660" end="00:52:36.190" style="s2">air our a this thing seems to be very</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.290" end="00:52:37.900" style="s2">difficult to transmit outdoors yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.190" end="00:52:40.620" style="s2">talked about a couple of live streams</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.900" end="00:52:43.810" style="s2">ago a result out of China that tracked</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.620" end="00:52:45.910" style="s2">7,000 plus cases community transmission</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.810" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">cases rather than travel cases only one</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.910" end="00:52:50.350" style="s2">maybe two of which were understood to</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:51.850" style="s2">have been transmitted outdoors yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.350" end="00:52:53.860" style="s2">what I would say is if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.850" end="00:52:56.470" style="s2">think about what behavior to engage in I</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.860" end="00:52:58.450" style="s2">would say being outdoors makes things</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.470" end="00:52:59.980" style="s2">better and not worse obviously if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.450" end="00:53:01.660" style="s2">in a house with nobody who&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.980" end="00:53:03.910" style="s2">infection then your house is probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.660" end="00:53:05.380" style="s2">pretty safe so going outdoors is not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.910" end="00:53:07.240" style="s2">step in the right direction but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.380" end="00:53:12.130" style="s2">probably not too dangerous but if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.240" end="00:53:15.970" style="s2">couple it with social distancing masks</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.130" end="00:53:19.630" style="s2">and common sense then it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.970" end="00:53:19.940" style="s2">there is in fact an opportunity cost to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.630" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.940" end="00:53:24.650" style="s2">going outdoors that the cost of being in</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">a building drives up your likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.650" end="00:53:27.950" style="s2">contracting the thing what would</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:30.110" style="s2">eventually I mean in indoor air</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.950" end="00:53:33.020" style="s2">pollution is a real thing so even put</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.110" end="00:53:34.580" style="s2">aside if you live alone and you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.020" end="00:53:36.380" style="s2">had anyone else in your house and so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.580" end="00:53:38.270" style="s2">really know that the virus isn&#39;t in your</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.380" end="00:53:40.070" style="s2">house that doesn&#39;t mean that the air in</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.270" end="00:53:42.010" style="s2">your house is healthy to be breathing so</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:26.180" style="s2">have a protective effect um it may</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.570" end="00:54:28.550" style="s2">prevent you from getting it and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.180" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">really seems very likely to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.550" end="00:54:33.820" style="s2">severity if you do get it so here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:36.350" style="s2">we I think are beginning to understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.820" end="00:54:38.990" style="s2">going outside reduces the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.350" end="00:54:43.010" style="s2">transmission it also increases your</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.990" end="00:54:46.070" style="s2">ability to fend off the disease if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.010" end="00:54:49.480" style="s2">do get it on the basis that vitamin D is</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.070" end="00:54:52.850" style="s2">produced when UV light hits the skin</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.480" end="00:54:55.670" style="s2">therefore to the extent that regulations</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.850" end="00:54:57.050" style="s2">have said don&#39;t go out stay in your home</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.670" end="00:54:59.180" style="s2">what they actually do is they create</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.050" end="00:55:00.770" style="s2">vitamin D deficiencies because even if</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.180" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s in your food it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.770" end="00:55:03.980" style="s2">enough of it that way the way we create</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:07.820" style="s2">vitamin D involves effectively</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.980" end="00:55:09.950" style="s2">photosynthesis of it that people whose</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.820" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">instinct was to go outside were safer</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.950" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">and laws that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:17.510" style="s2">scolded people for going outside you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">mentioned one case in which people were</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.510" end="00:55:23.000" style="s2">told not to sit in their garden there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:25.700" style="s2">frontal ruk right that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.000" end="00:55:27.860" style="s2">all counterproductive on the list of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.700" end="00:55:30.380" style="s2">things for how to protect yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.860" end="00:55:33.319" style="s2">this disease should be sunlight exposure</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.380" end="00:55:36.259" style="s2">to sunlight right do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.319" end="00:55:40.039" style="s2">social distancing where your mask but go</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.259" end="00:55:41.449" style="s2">outside so the me just put this up for I</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.039" end="00:55:44.329" style="s2">know you have someplace else you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.449" end="00:55:47.150" style="s2">going here but our friend Marsha Burke</p>

<p begin="00:55:47.150" end="00:55:51.430" style="s2">the instruction is in fact please go</p>

<p begin="00:56:04.190" end="00:56:09.499" style="s2">things but this is the only place that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.859" end="00:56:12.079" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen actually an explicit directive</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.499" end="00:56:13.819" style="s2">from a government official saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:15.279" style="s2">actually we want you to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.819" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">of what everyone else is saying right</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.279" end="00:56:20.359" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the final point which I</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:21.619" style="s2">think we have no way to calibrate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.359" end="00:56:24.709" style="s2">importance of at this point</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.619" end="00:56:26.690" style="s2">but there is a question especially in</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.709" end="00:56:30.109" style="s2">light of a very frightening scenario</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.690" end="00:56:33.109" style="s2">that is unfolding that a to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.109" end="00:56:36.979" style="s2">that anything normal can be safe enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.109" end="00:56:38.630" style="s2">to engage in is mental health wise bound</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.979" end="00:56:40.579" style="s2">to be a positive thing so how many</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.630" end="00:56:42.979" style="s2">suicides will we prevent if people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.579" end="00:56:44.269" style="s2">encouraged to go out to frankly know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.979" end="00:56:46.069" style="s2">that there are other people in the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.269" end="00:56:48.529" style="s2">like physically be in their presence</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.069" end="00:56:51.400" style="s2">without being in danger these things</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.529" end="00:56:57.019" style="s2">have a very positive benefit and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.400" end="00:57:00.259" style="s2">frightening to me is if we to some</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.019" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">extent cancel some part of spring/summer</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.259" end="00:57:07.039" style="s2">if we reduce people&#39;s ability to enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:10.269" style="s2">the outdoors the way they do then what</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.039" end="00:57:12.289" style="s2">happens to us as winter descends I</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.269" end="00:57:14.690" style="s2">really think that this is a frightening</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.289" end="00:57:17.989" style="s2">prospect in light of the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.690" end="00:57:20.449" style="s2">don&#39;t really see an endgame here if</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.989" end="00:57:25.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a vaccine coming it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.449" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">year and a half two years or more off so</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.160" end="00:57:29.619" style="s2">to the extent that we are in this for</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">the long haul</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.619" end="00:57:36.249" style="s2">doing things that reduce the mental</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:39.949" style="s2">hazard of it which seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.249" end="00:57:40.699" style="s2">epidemiologically safe and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.949" end="00:57:44.749" style="s2">nice out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.699" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">so anyway people whose instinct was to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.749" end="00:57:47.960" style="s2">go outside were right</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.490" style="s2">government to the extent that it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.960" end="00:57:51.620" style="s2">telling him to stay inside was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.490" end="00:57:54.170" style="s2">that was true all along now the data is</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.620" end="00:57:57.350" style="s2">beginning to tell us that so that is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.170" end="00:58:00.230" style="s2">model for how the counterintuitive here</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.350" end="00:58:03.140" style="s2">was a very important thing and I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.230" end="00:58:05.360" style="s2">would add one more thing which is just</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.140" end="00:58:08.180" style="s2">like the subway study that we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.360" end="00:58:11.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe three livestreams ago</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.180" end="00:58:16.100" style="s2">in which it became clear that New York</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.570" end="00:58:19.190" style="s2">City&#39;s responds to Coba 19 which was to</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.100" end="00:58:21.890" style="s2">try to enforce stay at home for people</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.190" end="00:58:25.550" style="s2">was to ask them not to take the subway</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.890" end="00:58:27.050" style="s2">and the what it&#39;s not the MTA but</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.550" end="00:58:29.480" style="s2">whatever the Transit Authority in New</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.050" end="00:58:30.950" style="s2">York City is responded by cutting back</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.480" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">the number of trains such that those</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.950" end="00:58:33.740" style="s2">people who were on trains who were</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:35.240" style="s2">forced to take trains because they were</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.740" end="00:58:38.060" style="s2">essential workers for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.240" end="00:58:40.130" style="s2">were then tightly packed and we&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.060" end="00:58:44.050" style="s2">more likely to be effective ly spreading</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.130" end="00:58:47.480" style="s2">the disease so having a public response</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.050" end="00:58:50.030" style="s2">B we&#39;re going to create scarcity in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.480" end="00:58:54.080" style="s2">order to try to get you not to use this</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.030" end="00:58:55.910" style="s2">resource forces higher density of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.080" end="00:58:58.040" style="s2">and therefore higher risk to those</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.910" end="00:59:03.170" style="s2">people who are using it so shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.040" end="00:59:06.230" style="s2">a bunch of nature areas is and leaving a</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.170" end="00:59:09.740" style="s2">few open as ends up being the case in I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.230" end="00:59:12.080" style="s2">think California is going to crunch</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.740" end="00:59:13.940" style="s2">people into a few of the areas whereas</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.080" end="00:59:16.190" style="s2">letting them spread out across an entire</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.940" end="00:59:18.800" style="s2">landscape and make decisions for</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.190" end="00:59:20.780" style="s2">themselves in this case in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.800" end="00:59:22.040" style="s2">in a in a situation in which we</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.780" end="00:59:23.840" style="s2">understood that we understand this to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.040" end="00:59:26.780" style="s2">healthy transmission doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.840" end="00:59:28.490" style="s2">happen outdoors much and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.780" end="00:59:29.780" style="s2">healthy physically but also mentally to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.490" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">go through the examples you were just</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.780" end="00:59:36.470" style="s2">talking about the this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:38.330" style="s2">we should be doing and outdoors actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.470" end="00:59:41.210" style="s2">becomes more dangerous the more tightly</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.330" end="00:59:43.880" style="s2">packed you are right that&#39;s that that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.210" end="00:59:46.370" style="s2">the condition under which being outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.880" end="00:59:47.780" style="s2">is potentially more dangerous everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.370" end="00:59:50.210" style="s2">becomes more dangerous everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.780" end="00:59:52.310" style="s2">becomes more dangerous the more tightly</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.210" end="00:59:56.120" style="s2">packed you are and so if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.310" end="00:59:59.060" style="s2">recognize that nature and outdoors is</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.120" end="01:00:00.230" style="s2">actually safer than indoors leaving all</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.060" end="01:00:04.640" style="s2">of that open for</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.230" end="01:00:06.410" style="s2">people to explore and to be in and to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.640" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">hopefully making the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.410" end="01:00:09.650" style="s2">careful decisions that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:12.680" style="s2">when they go into the market or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.650" end="01:00:14.330" style="s2">hardware store whatever it&#39;s clearly a</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.680" end="01:00:16.460" style="s2">better move than saying well we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.330" end="01:00:19.100" style="s2">shut down some and not others and thus</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.460" end="01:00:21.170" style="s2">force those of you who are feeling the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.100" end="01:00:24.950" style="s2">need to go outside into a smaller amount</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.170" end="01:00:30.369" style="s2">of space and it also reflects something</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.950" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been getting at which is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.369" end="01:00:37.369" style="s2">the governmental structure that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">dictate exactly what to do is feeble</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.369" end="01:00:43.340" style="s2">compared to a structure that tells us</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:47.260" style="s2">what the objective is and gives us room</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.340" end="01:00:50.300" style="s2">to navigate yeah so I have argued every</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.260" end="01:00:54.109" style="s2">functional complex system that involves</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.300" end="01:00:56.980" style="s2">people also involves discretion so what</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.109" end="01:01:00.710" style="s2">we really want is not a politicized</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.980" end="01:01:02.750" style="s2">populace in which you know the folks on</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.710" end="01:01:05.000" style="s2">the right are dismissive of the need to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.750" end="01:01:07.700" style="s2">take action and the folks on the left</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.000" end="01:01:09.290" style="s2">are insisting on the action and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.700" end="01:01:11.890" style="s2">that what we need is a recognition that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.290" end="01:01:15.290" style="s2">we all are better off if this thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.890" end="01:01:18.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t spread further if the cost of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.290" end="01:01:21.770" style="s2">is low because people are well prepared</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.609" end="01:01:50.090" style="s2">or talking or something like that then</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.500" end="01:01:52.430" style="s2">you can steer clear of them in a way</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.090" end="01:01:57.740" style="s2">that minimizes the chances of contacting</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.430" end="01:02:00.740" style="s2">something so being informed and having</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.109" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">simple so you know exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.910" end="01:02:18.869" style="s2">but leaves a lot of possible value</p>

<p begin="01:02:18.869" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">the our mark but I&#39;d like to maybe just</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.690" end="01:02:27.030" style="s2">flag what&#39;s happening in Manaus and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:30.750" style="s2">maybe we come back to it another time</p>

<p begin="01:02:52.560" end="01:02:58.530" style="s2">quickly put on screen this image which</p>

<p begin="01:03:16.800" end="01:03:23.849" style="s2">now say how many more people died in a</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.810" end="01:03:38.490" style="s2">that it really seems to to be a very</p>

<p begin="01:03:38.490" end="01:03:44.160" style="s2">potentially has error in both directions</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.700" end="01:03:46.170" style="s2">but overall the idea of excess deaths of</p>

<p begin="01:03:46.170" end="01:03:51.839" style="s2">than we were expecting</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.730" end="01:03:54.810" style="s2">is is a really apt one and in Manaus the</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.839" end="01:03:57.450" style="s2">xxxx the excess deaths are - closing on</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.810" end="01:03:59.609" style="s2">three times for the period of the last</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.450" end="01:04:01.230" style="s2">six weeks or so and they they report</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.609" end="01:04:03.089" style="s2">that it just showed up there in early</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.230" end="01:04:05.099" style="s2">March of course none of these reports of</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.089" end="01:04:08.010" style="s2">when it actually showed up in particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.099" end="01:04:09.270" style="s2">places are necessarily accurate maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.010" end="01:04:15.990" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.270" end="01:04:19.109" style="s2">about next time but one of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.990" end="01:04:22.219" style="s2">in Manaus Manaus is literally at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.109" end="01:04:24.679" style="s2">confluence of the Amazon and there</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.219" end="01:04:26.689" style="s2">which are to these massive rivers and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.679" end="01:04:28.489" style="s2">the Amazon just got the name afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.689" end="01:04:30.019" style="s2">so everyone knows the name of the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.489" end="01:04:32.660" style="s2">and not the name of every renege row</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.019" end="01:04:34.609" style="s2">there it&#39;s its place I&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.660" end="01:04:36.679" style="s2">and fell in love with and really wanted</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.609" end="01:04:40.489" style="s2">us to go back to and then we went had</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.679" end="01:04:43.130" style="s2">kids instead so we haven&#39;t been back but</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.489" end="01:04:45.199" style="s2">it&#39;s truly an extraordinary place it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.130" end="01:04:48.589" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the sort of center of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.199" end="01:04:50.150" style="s2">Brazilian Amazon and for a long time you</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.589" end="01:04:52.670" style="s2">can only get there by boat or by plane</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.150" end="01:04:56.209" style="s2">there is no a road unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.670" end="01:05:00.019" style="s2">fortunately but you know massive</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.209" end="01:05:01.759" style="s2">bustling metropolis that is not in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.019" end="01:05:04.279" style="s2">industrial center of Brazil in the South</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.759" end="01:05:06.259" style="s2">you know Rio and Sao Paulo and for</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.279" end="01:05:11.679" style="s2">taking there being the massive centers</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.259" end="01:05:13.999" style="s2">of you know of economy for Brazil and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.679" end="01:05:17.390" style="s2">bolson ro but the president of Brazil</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.999" end="01:05:20.329" style="s2">has long sent long before this</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.390" end="01:05:23.959" style="s2">particular pandemic struck made it clear</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.329" end="01:05:27.439" style="s2">that he sees the Amazon as a untapped</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.959" end="01:05:29.959" style="s2">way to make money that he sees the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.439" end="01:05:32.209" style="s2">forest as mostly an impediment to</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.959" end="01:05:35.929" style="s2">development and the indigenous peoples</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.209" end="01:05:37.729" style="s2">as same and while Manaus is not you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.929" end="01:05:40.609" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s surrounded by forests and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.729" end="01:05:42.859" style="s2">there are indigenous tribes somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.609" end="01:05:44.299" style="s2">near it it is not itself you know we</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.859" end="01:05:48.739" style="s2">filled with indigenous people or</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.299" end="01:05:52.339" style="s2">forested place it probably got ignored a</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.739" end="01:05:55.189" style="s2">bit in part because this was already a</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.339" end="01:05:59.269" style="s2">city and already a region in Brazil that</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.189" end="01:06:03.279" style="s2">was not being treated well by the by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.269" end="01:06:06.380" style="s2">governance yeah it&#39;s also the case that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.279" end="01:06:08.839" style="s2">early on there was the expectation and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.380" end="01:06:10.819" style="s2">based on a pattern that people had</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.839" end="01:06:15.769" style="s2">thought they had seen where this wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.819" end="01:06:19.219" style="s2">being spread in tropical climates and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.769" end="01:06:21.140" style="s2">know that now in Manaus the question is</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.219" end="01:06:23.179" style="s2">will they be the next quiet kill that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.140" end="01:06:25.549" style="s2">that&#39;s actually on their minds and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.179" end="01:06:27.949" style="s2">fact that there is a man aus crisis ana</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.549" end="01:06:29.779" style="s2">Guayaquil crisis says that whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.949" end="01:06:32.630" style="s2">is that might be somewhat protective</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.779" end="01:06:34.219" style="s2">about these climates it&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.630" end="01:06:35.230" style="s2">protective and probably means very</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.219" end="01:06:38.080" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.230" end="01:06:43.150" style="s2">most of us and go ocular sweltering hot</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.080" end="01:06:47.020" style="s2">humid places right so I think as we are</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.150" end="01:06:49.540" style="s2">and I really hope people will sideline</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.020" end="01:06:50.830" style="s2">the political dimensions the question</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.540" end="01:06:53.140" style="s2">about what we should do</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.830" end="01:06:56.230" style="s2">mustn&#39;t be a political question the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.140" end="01:06:58.090" style="s2">question about where this came from also</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.230" end="01:07:01.690" style="s2">must not be a political question and it</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.090" end="01:07:03.580" style="s2">is becoming an unavoidable one so in any</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.690" end="01:07:06.510" style="s2">case maybe we will return there another</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.580" end="01:07:10.660" style="s2">time but for the moment we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.510" end="01:07:13.780" style="s2">different outcomes based on different</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.660" end="01:07:16.800" style="s2">kinds of responses a political actor</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.780" end="01:07:19.630" style="s2">will cherry-pick that data in order to</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.800" end="01:07:22.510" style="s2">support whatever policy position they</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.630" end="01:07:24.400" style="s2">think is right the rest of us should be</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.510" end="01:07:28.119" style="s2">looking at these things and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.400" end="01:07:30.070" style="s2">well we know that New York can happen we</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.119" end="01:07:32.200" style="s2">know that manaus and Guayaquil can</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.070" end="01:07:35.020" style="s2">happen we know that Italy can happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.200" end="01:07:37.540" style="s2">what we don&#39;t want to do is alter the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.020" end="01:07:40.900" style="s2">protocols so that you know la becomes</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.540" end="01:07:44.080" style="s2">the next New York if that&#39;s possible we</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.900" end="01:07:48.340" style="s2">want to learn from what has happened and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.080" end="01:07:50.590" style="s2">frankly share the burden of it the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.340" end="01:07:52.210" style="s2">political solution to this is no</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.590" end="01:07:54.700" style="s2">solution at all and what it effectively</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.210" end="01:07:58.619" style="s2">does is it puts the pathogen in charge</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.700" end="01:08:01.930" style="s2">so really I can&#39;t stress enough how</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.619" end="01:08:03.790" style="s2">important it is that we don&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.930" end="01:08:05.260" style="s2">politics to drive which then says</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.790" end="01:08:06.790" style="s2">something about well how are we going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.260" end="01:08:08.140" style="s2">reign on our politics because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.790" end="01:08:10.020" style="s2">exactly what they&#39;re setting us up for</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.140" end="01:08:15.369" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.020" end="01:08:19.239" style="s2">okay so we are going to return in 15</p>
