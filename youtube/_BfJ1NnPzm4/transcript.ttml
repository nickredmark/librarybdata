<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:05.310" style="s2">itself is work so here&#39;s a real question</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.419" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">if all money is created through loans</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.310" end="00:05:10.139" style="s2">where does the money come from to pay</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:12.330" style="s2">for the interest let&#39;s say we reset the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.139" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">system to zero own a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.330" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">into existence and charge seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">Interest we now have a total of $1,000</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">money in circulation because the money</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:32.849" style="s2">has never will this is the obvious if</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">there was only one loan being issued to</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.170" end="00:14:18.260" style="s2">but do you really believe that the CEO</p>
