<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:46.400" style="s2">and kind of the way i think about that</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">and we can kill a lot more people from</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">the records of previous warfare and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">pretty clear that we&#39;re going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">developing more projectile capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re going to get catapults</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">and then cannons and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">and we&#39;re also developing technology for</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">accumulation being able to store</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">you know smithing technology and so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">can see that as our technologies</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">growing both our capacity to kill each</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">other and our capacity to unrenewably</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">destroy the environment and so we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">that there are deserts near our</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">civilization that are the results of our</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re growing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">that the military technology we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">getting that&#39;s up ratcheting is also up</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">ratcheting on the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">sides and it&#39;s not that hard to just</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">kind of run the scenario and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">if we keep increasing our technology and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">using it in ways that directly harm each</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">other or indirectly harm the commons we</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">just don&#39;t get to do that forever on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">finite playing field</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a reckoning that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">to come with how we use power</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">as we keep getting more powerful and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">we get the kind of purgatory story that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">right now it&#39;s only a few patient people</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">profits that see that it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">this way</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">but there&#39;s a certain point at which the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">fact that we don&#39;t get to keep going</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">this way becomes eminently obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">and if we continue to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">use our power in game theoretic ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">that advantage</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">self at the expense of other or commons</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">and in doing so we have to get more we</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">have to get some asymmetric power over</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">the other seeking to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">the moment we deploy the asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">power it gets reverse engineered and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">iterated on so all sides are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">exponentially up ratcheting power that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">is used to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">externalize harm as soon as that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">eminent then there is this kind of great</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">reckoning of if we keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">we do we don&#39;t get to keep doing that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">a sustainable way so we get something</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">a collapse in a health scenario and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">get something like a not collapse</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">scenario we have to be safe stewards</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">for our power and we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">any record of the thing we call</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">civilization using our power all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">well right</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">meaning we&#39;ve of course used power to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">some lovely things and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:03.440" style="s2">dreadful things but if we take the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">distribution of the types of choices</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">that we made as</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">sumerians or romans or british or</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">egyptians or whatever and we multiply</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">the power of how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">made choices by an exponential set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">capacities</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">that self-terminates everywhere because</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">and this is where the mythopoetics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">heaven on earth or the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">chains that would have to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">comes in which is if technology gives us</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">something like the power of gods we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">to have something like the love and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">wisdom of gods to be able to rightly</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">wield it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">otherwise the misapplication of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">power self-terminates</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">and so i think that metaphor holds quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">strongly</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">and i think we can kind of think of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">as that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">entering something like the purgatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">phase where rather than a few patient</p>

<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">you kind of have to be not paying</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">and whether we&#39;re looking at climate</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">by a tiny bit because we&#39;re developing</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">of the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">advantaging a particular metric like gdp</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">at the expense of other metrics like</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">and as long as we are advantaging some</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">things at the expense of other things</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">with exponentially more capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">going to be self-terminating across all</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">of the applications of the power and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">yeah i think it is fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving into a place where at</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">least there is a general sensibility of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">this that is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">and even amongst some smaller</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">populations like people on your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">you know listenership probably some</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">deeper understanding that it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">scenario it&#39;s a lot of scenarios and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not the result of a few bad dumb</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">structure of civilization itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:42.000" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and and so i&#39;d be curious</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">um i i believe that you&#39;ve read jem</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.000" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">bendel&#39;s deep adaptation paper and he</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">was on the show and</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">we explored together his sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">of what he calls the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">near-term collapse</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">of social systems due to climate change</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">and obviously that&#39;s even that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">one vector of collapse right</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">is is ecological related collapse and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">uh that that question of like we&#39;re past</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">the point of no return</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">and now it&#39;s sort of inevitable a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">i hear are looking at this situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">that way that we&#39;re kind of past this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">point of no return</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">how do you relate to that possibility is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">that something you&#39;re tracking</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">and and like do you agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m curious what your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">i think that we&#39;re past the point of no</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">return</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">uh in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">the type of world order that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">have and the underlying civilization</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">architectures</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">are definitely going to collapse that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">and our species has to collapse with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">it just means that if they</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">are if our species is going to not</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">collapse with it it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">figure out new systems for uh mediating</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">itself right</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">and um yeah so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not fatalistic about this i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">which civilizations can&#39;t further which</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">which systems can&#39;t further from an</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">architectural</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">perspective so like let&#39;s okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">bunch of things worth looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">first we should make the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">between an existential risk and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">catastrophic risk meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">if we if we describe an existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">as an extinction a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">lack to continue our the our existence</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">as a species</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">there are risks that could be fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">existential to homo sapien or even fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">existential to say all mammals or all</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">hydrocarbon life</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think there&#39;s that many of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">them that are all that probable</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">then there are catastrophic risks where</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">uh some humans in pockets making</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">it through a world war scenario or</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">environmental collapse scenario but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">so much of what we have developed as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">and i think there are a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">scenarios that are more likely of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">class but for now i would just put them</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">all together as</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">um you know massive to complete collapse</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">type scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">so if we look at climate change for</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there are any climate</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">change scenarios that very reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">are existential</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">meaning directly meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">we create a climate where that is venus</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">formed where</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">humans just can&#39;t live in the climate i</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">likely so i do think we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:46.040" style="s2">where environmental issues that include</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">climate change but also include</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.040" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">desertification and fishery collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">resource issues of various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">lead to massive human migrations and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">that those</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">massive human migrations lead to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">uh really significantly</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">increased resource pressures which</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">definitely have a good chance</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">of leading to war and escalating war and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">economic collapse and grid collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">yeah and so uh you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">future thinkers podcasts it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">important to listen to as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">most important podcasts i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">in my estimation and in that podcast you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:31.759" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">this idea of scaled interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.759" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">as being a kind of solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">current problem set or problematic</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">architecture of our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious if there&#39;s anywhere that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">you now see</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">signs of the emergence of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">collective intelligence you know the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">that could help us thread this needle</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">i understand you may not be able to name</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">the specifics because these things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">often very fragile when they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">but even just to know that you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">like embryonic versions of what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">been calling for uh would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">yeah just curious to hear if that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">happening yet in your view</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">okay so when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">solutions in terms of new types of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">collective intelligence and sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">systems that could inform new types of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">choice making</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">new social architectures to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">look at what an adequate social</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">architecture would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">we do need to to understand adequacy we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">do need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">the nature of the problems in current</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">social architecture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">you mentioned that uh a number of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">were discussed in future thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">ways that took a while so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">i won&#39;t take a while with it but i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">it might be worth just briefly naming</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">what the primary issues are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">so that then we could say uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">emergent experiments that would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">interesting would be things that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">address these types of issues does that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">yeah okay so briefly</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">we were just mentioning that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">lot of different types of risks that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">emerge from the same underlying dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked about these underlying</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">dynamics as</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">generator functions which means we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">a particular type of pollution or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">particular type of resource depletion</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">or a particular type of warfare we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">looking at what creates pollution</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">or resource depletion or warfare writ</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">large in the nature of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">humans coordinate activity and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">if we can identify underneath all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">future risk scenarios we can identify</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">you know hopefully relatively small set</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">social architectures or generator</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">functions that give rise to all those</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">then we can say well rather than solve</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">for the instance of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">collapse scenario can we solve for</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">the class of the generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:58.080" style="s2">writ large and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">if we could find a finite set of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.080" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">generator functions that we could show</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">to be subsumptive that all of the risks</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">come from these things and we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">actually solve for the class of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">then that would be the kernel of a new</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">civilization model</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">in a civilization that would be by its</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">design parameters not self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">and so we&#39;ll just kind of describe that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">real quick</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways to think about why</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">why a particular system that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">autopoetic right that&#39;s self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">and self-advancing why it would</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">self-terminate</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not uncommon if we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">about cancer in a body</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">cancer is a autopoetic self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">right so the cancer cells figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">figure that they can defect on the rest</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">of the body i</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">i am saying this in an anthropomorphic</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">way but they defect on</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">the agreement of the rest of the body in</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">a way that has them actually gain more</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.200" style="s2">resources they consume sugar faster than</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">the surrounding cells and they replicate</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.200" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">faster so they&#39;re doing an increased</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">consumption and reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">but in doing so they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">debasing the integrity of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">and if they succeed if the rest the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">system doesn&#39;t reverse them</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.720" style="s2">you know stop them doing that then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">actually have the most cancer cells</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">right before the body dies</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">and then they all die and so as they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">are in the short term advancing what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">seems like is their mission they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">also debasing the substrate upon which</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">they depend</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">and because the cancer cells emerge out</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">of a healthy body that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.120" style="s2">live for a lot longer than a cancerous</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">body can</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.120" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">and so in general we can say that if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">have any system that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">out of a base a base layer a more</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">fundamental layer</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">if that emergent layer debases the layer</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:52.159" style="s2">that it emerges out of and depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">that system is going to self-terminate</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.159" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">eventually right you can&#39;t debase your</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">own substrate sustainably</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">but we can see that nature gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">humans we see that humans give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">and then humans use the tech to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">uh kill each other debase nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">and make better tech to do both of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">that&#39;s an unstable scenario and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">if we want to have stability of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">creatures that have the amount of power</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">that technology enables us to have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">is totally unprecedented in the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">then if nature gives rise to humans and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">humans give rise to tech the tech has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">be in service to the actual resilience</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">of nature so that there is a closed</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">resiliency loop well building</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">technology and infrastructure with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">the goal of increasing the orderly</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">complexity and the meta-stability and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:49.679" style="s2">anti-fragility of nature itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">something we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.679" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">like ever done but it&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">obviously have to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">right and so we can start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">what would what currently is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">underneath how we develop tech there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">both a set of motivation structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">economic structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">um and a type of sense making we develop</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">a particular piece of technology for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">particular goal</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to interact with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">things other than the goal for which we</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">made it which are areas where that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">externality of harm right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:26.799" style="s2">both a change of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">the motivation of how we do technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.799" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">the comprehensivity of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">the nature of the sense making process</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">that would have to change for us to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">able to do tech properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">thinking about a civilization that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">debasing its own substrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">self-terminating just so people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">um of why self-termination you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">would happen in that way</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">a simple way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">generator functions that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">a generator function that i think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">familiar to most people is just a topic</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">of perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">writ large the the idea of what perverse</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">incentive is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">which is if we want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">biodiversity loss and we say okay why</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">are we extincting so many species</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">and why are the large fish species so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">overfished and the whales and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">why have we cut down so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">trees as soon as we have a system where</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">the trees are worth more debt as lumber</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">than they are alive</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">or the fish are worth more dead than</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">they are swimming in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">and war raises gdp and is more</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">profitable than peace and sick people</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">are more profitable than healthy people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">then and on and on underneath all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">those problems is a perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">complex where someone has a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">incentive to cause</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">a problem than they do to not cause a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">problem right</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">yeah and if we take a look at the like</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">dead trees example</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">we get this multipolar trap where</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t me cutting down this tree or</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:58.159" style="s2">these few trees is not killing all</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">forests</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.159" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">but it is getting my family meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">ahead and my f</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.840" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">you know like if i leave them my family</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get ahead and doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">eat right and if i do this then my</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">family gets ahead</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">think about it at kind of a great</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">debasing our whole substrate scale and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">don&#39;t even think i have</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">options because i don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">another way other than cutting the trees</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">down and if i don&#39;t cut the trees down</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">someone else is going to cut the trees</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">down so i don&#39;t even have an option to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">leave them</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:31.679" style="s2">and so if someone else going to cut them</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">down anyways then i might as well do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">to be able to get my family to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">forward so we have a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">person or each company or each country</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">acting in its own</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">rational near-term self-interest leads</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">and so each person doing what actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">seems smart to them in the near term</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">is actually suicidal for the whole over</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">the long term it&#39;s a dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:54.000" style="s2">collective intelligence where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">coupling of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">the choices of the individual actors</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t couple to good choices at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">level of the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">right so we have a system where</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">for the most part nobody really wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">there are some examples there are some</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:12.159" style="s2">exceptions that matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">like you know if i was russia i would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.159" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">pretty stoked on climate change because</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">the opening up of the northern passage</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">would be economically powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">but for the most part nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">climate change</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">and yet all of us are doing actions that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">are advancing climate change</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">and but in our own self-interest i need</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">to just put some gas on the car to drive</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">and what i&#39;m doing is so tiny relative</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">to the whole thing and on and on whether</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an individual actor</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">corporate actor military actor and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">the presence of what everybody else is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">doing and so there&#39;s this weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">where the invisible hand of the market</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">the emergent property of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">interacting where they&#39;re all doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">utility maximization</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">within a current system is perpetuating</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">so the invisible hand of the market is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">driving climate change and driving</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">biodiversity loss and up ratcheting</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">exponential warfare even though no</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">actual actors really want any of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.960" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">and that is a dysfunctional collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.960" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">intelligence right</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">but basically a scenario where we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">game theoretic actors whether it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">individual person or a family or a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">or a nation-state or a corporation or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">political party or a race</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">that identifies as an in-group in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">for scarce resources with some other out</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">if they&#39;re acting in their own interest</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">and they&#39;re empowered by the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:36.640" style="s2">create technology</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">whether we&#39;re talking about social</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.640" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">technology like</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.480" style="s2">democracy or markets or physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">technology like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.480" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">extraction capacity from the environment</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">or information tech or warfare tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">the difference between humans and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">the rest of animals and nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">in this way because obviously in nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of cooperation there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">lot of symbiosis but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">and there are rivalries dynamics and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">might see</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">two animals of the same species actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">competing over reproductive opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">in a rivalrous way and even in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">zero-sum way and we might see a predator</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">and prey in a zero-sum dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">one specific predator hunting one prey</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">animal</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">and yet we still see this kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:25.600" style="s2">stability in nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">and so we take this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">you know hey the lions chasing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">eat the slow gazelle they don&#39;t catch</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">the fast ones so then</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">the fastest of the gazelles are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">that reproduce and the gazelles get</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">faster as a result of what the lions are</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">doing so hey this rivalry is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">good the competition drives innovation</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">the lions as a whole if they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">the gazelles would actually overpopulate</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">themselves into extinction so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">gazelles need the lions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">the lions make the gazelles better and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">the speed of the gazelles</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">getting away a lot of the time has the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">slow lion starve so the fast lions get</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">and you know etc and so we see that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">rivalry in this competition</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">is actually necessary because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.360" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">couldn&#39;t maintain without it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">and it upratchets everybody&#39;s capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">and drives this thing called evolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">and so we&#39;re like okay well that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">nature works so we should work that way</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">and hey that&#39;s how theory of markets</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">works right</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">and this is basically a simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">understanding social darwinism where we</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">reify</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">theory of markets as if it&#39;s a darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">and we say evolution is defined by</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">an environmental niche and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">selection dynamics inside of that niche</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">and the selection dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">are a result of three things mutation</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">survival selection and mate selection so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">the mutation</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">happens randomly in evolution right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">not consciously controlled where a lion</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">gets to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">i want my dna to mutate in this way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">just mutation</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">occurs from from gamma rays from</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">oxidative stress from copying errors</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">from whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">and so some mutations lead to a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">longer neck</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">and if that is advantageous because</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">there are leaves up high that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">being eaten</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">and a couple that have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">mutation breed together that moves in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">direction towards giraffes right</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">and but most mutations won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">advantageous and most of them will fail</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:28.320" style="s2">so we have basically mutation and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">which mutations survive</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.320" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">most of them aren&#39;t going to survive</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not even going to be able to eat</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:36.080" style="s2">which and then of the ones that survive</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">they mate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">and uh only those</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">genetics only those offspring go through</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">so for something to be selected for long</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">it has to survive and it has to be able</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">to reproduce so</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">we think about markets and we say well</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">demand in a supply and demand dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">demand is like an environmental niche</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">there is some resource there and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">something is going to emerge to fill</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">that niche to create a source of supply</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">so then it&#39;s usually not one something</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a number of some things competing</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">and so you get multiple people or</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">companies trying to make a product or</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">service to fulfill that demand but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">do slightly different versions they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">their own innovations and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">mutation</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s like modifications on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.080" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">and so most the companies are going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">fail and</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">only the company that actually figures</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">out how to provide the best value at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:28.720" style="s2">best price is the one that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">make it through</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.720" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">i.e survival selection and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">you got a couple companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">doing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">really positive and if they were to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">join ip it&#39;d be even better so you get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">merger or an acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:45.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s like kind of mate dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">where you get recombinatorial dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.200" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">underlying innovations and so we say</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">well great so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">markets drive innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">uh as a result of they drive innovation</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">and the competition pressure is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">a healthy good thing and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">get new tech and that&#39;s how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">get higher quality of life for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">this is of course not true at all and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">silly even though like</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not not true at all there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">truth to it but the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">it is fundamentally not true and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">can&#39;t model ourselves in a darwinian way</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">is because the other animals can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">upratchet their rival risk capacity with</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">and that really changes everything and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">so if we look at an apex predator say we</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">take an orca or a lion or a polar bear</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">one lion just can&#39;t do that much harm to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">lions or to all gazelles or to its whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">ecosystem it&#39;s just not that powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">but one person today</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">with nuclear weapons or biotech can</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">really a lot of stuff up</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">and so the system becomes very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">when one person or one group has so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">power relative to the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">right our technology has allowed us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">upratch it our power</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">relative to each other and relative to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">the other species and relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:07.360" style="s2">system as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">in a way that nothing in evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.360" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">anything even closely resembling</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">and so you think about a great white and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">its ability to uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">catch fish and then you think about an</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">ocean trawler with a mile long drift net</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:22.240" style="s2">in its ability to catch</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">fish and you&#39;re like oh we are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">not apex predators we can&#39;t model</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">ourselves as apex predators anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">if we keep competing for who&#39;s apex</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">predator in that way but we can pull up</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:34.159" style="s2">miles of fish at once we clearly debase</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">the whole the planet&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.159" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">support us</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">and so the key thing to really get is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">in nature the mutations that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">are symmetrically distributed across the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">entire ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">so all lions are undergoing mutation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">all gazelles are and there&#39;s similarity</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">from some lions to others and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">similarity in the mutation</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">dynamics between the lions and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">gazelles and also the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">everything else so you never get the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">lions getting a thousand times more</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">powerful in one</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">step irrespective of the gazelles having</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">a similar step</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">if they did you would actually lose the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">meta-stability of the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">the lion&#39;s gonna get a tiny bit faster</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">or the gazelle will get a tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">through a mutation as that happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">then the slowest of the gazelles will</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">get eaten the faster ones will now</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.120" style="s2">rebreed and combine and so you get this</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">thing where</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.120" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">power increases anywhere lead to power</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">increases everywhere because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">symmetry in the distribution of power</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">so that&#39;s a result of the symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">distribution of mutation pressures and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">the co-selective pressures</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">the fact that as one is elevating it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">having real-time interaction with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">other one</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">so they&#39;re also elevating which is why</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">an invasive species can ruin a whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">is that it didn&#39;t have co-selective</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">pressure so if we bring an invasive</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">species in that figured out</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">how to have some kind of power that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">whole ecosystem is not adapted to deal</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">it can really massively up a system</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">us developing the kind of tech that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">have makes us like</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">like a super invasive species across</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">every ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">with nothing ever being able to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">check that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:19.919" style="s2">and so this is where when we recognize</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">no other animal has the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.919" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">destroy whole ecosystems or build</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">new types of ecosystems or genetically</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">engineer new species and hybridize new</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">species and extinct species so</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">we we don&#39;t have power like apex</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">predators where we can model ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">that way and all do our own competitive</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">we&#39;re not see one something else to</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:34.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s not enough for the other</p>

<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">and so if we ask well how long do we</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">nuclear why was north korea about to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">a nuclear war with us a year ago and now</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">everything is fine for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">since the 70s what the happened</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">did they really have technical nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">capabilities how much stuff really</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">leaked out of fukushima is fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">solved now</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">what is the real risk with ai elon says</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s too late bill gates says there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.800" end="00:41:04.560" style="s2">risk at all</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">what we find is that on the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.560" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">concerning issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">world that are the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">most pertinent to the continuation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">life on earth</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">everybody gives up on sense-making or</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">defects to believing what their in-group</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">believes because it&#39;s too hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">to actually figure stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.839" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">and when i say defect i mean defects on</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">their own sense making</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">and so rival risk dynamics are going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">lead to not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">physical warfare and economic warfare</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">but also information and narrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">warfare which</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">the pollution of the epistemic commons</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">through that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">ends up being a destruction of</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">sense-making and the capacity to even</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">know what a good choice would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">to even know what issues we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">make choices in service to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">and so of course if we have x if we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">more people with more</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">power per capita you know totally that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">is increasingly blind</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">moving increasingly powerfully and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">quickly that&#39;s not a good scenario</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">and so here&#39;s something i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">with regard to this one and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">and sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">so many people have tried to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">the vaccine thing right like wait are</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">totally safe or are they totally bad or</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">is it like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">the ones that cure polio are worth it</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">but not the flu ones or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">the problem was to marisol but without</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">the themarisol they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">fine or maybe or they try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.280" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">was lyme disease a bio weapon or they</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">tried to figure out what really happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">with 911 or whatever it is or</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">the current state of ai and they get</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">so much conflicting information that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">they just give up</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">yeah right and they give up on actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">making sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">but then what happens you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">well what does it mean to give</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">up on making sense of the world you live</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">in in the most consequential topics</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">well it&#39;s a form of nihilism right</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">this it&#39;s a kind of epistemic nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">because if reality is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">then i need to understand it to know how</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">to interact in an appropriate way</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">and if i give up on understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">because it seems impossible or too</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2"> hard</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">can i actually make choices</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">that are aligned with what&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">if i have no idea of what world i live</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:23.359" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">and so you know something i can talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:31.280" style="s2">about what is emerging or not or what</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">i would encourage is for people to look</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.280" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">at the nature of their epistemic drive</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:37.520" style="s2">and their epistemic nihilism and like</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">how much</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">are they actually committed to making</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">sense earnestly of the world they live</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">in as a basis</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">to have their choice possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">come back to that because i want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">finish these general functions and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">talked for a long time and you probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">have questions so</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">briefly we&#39;ll say rivalrous dynamics we</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:44:00.720" style="s2">gotta</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">address the other thing is intrinsic to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.720" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">how we do problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">is that for the most part humanity</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">solves problems in ways that make worse</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">there&#39;s not that many exceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:17.200" style="s2">whether we&#39;re creating a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">piece of technology to solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.200" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">or we&#39;re creating a bill</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">you know or political solution or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">creating a new set of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">mimetics for like a social solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">or whatever any of the methods we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">new company for a market solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">so you look at it and you say all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">it was we were running out of easy big</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">and so there was a problem of feeding</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">enough people and whatever so we figured</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">out the plow</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">well the plow was the awesome for us but</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">it was also the beginning of massive</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">desertification</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">and having enough surplus that war was</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">really advantageous for other people to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">come capture our surplus</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">and the beginning of the types of animal</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">husbandry that led to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">so many of the problems in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">actually the beginning of certain types</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">fundamental patriarchies and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">wow a lot of things got up by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">nature of how we did the plow thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">and if we all the way back to stone</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">tools if we hadn&#39;t got stone tools</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">there&#39;d be no environmental issues</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">right like we wouldn&#39;t have went and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">became the apex predator in every</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">environment and started extincting</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">earlier species</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">if we hadn&#39;t got the wheel we come to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">modern time we say all right we</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">we have you know i think this example is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">funny but it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">a good one the internal combustion</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">engine to be able to make the automobile</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">was super helpful for us we could travel</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">further faster easier than we could by</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">horse</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">and carriage by a lot and we were trying</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">to solve the problem of the limitation</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">of horses that we had to feed them</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">that they all over the place you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">know those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">and so we the internal combustion engine</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">the horseshit problem right london was</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">covered in horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">and the other associated horse</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">difficulties and that&#39;s awesome and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">all like the quality of life associated</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">with cars</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">but then we look at the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">internal combustion engines</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">that left cars and also went into you</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">tanks and trucks and ships and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">and we recognize that all of the oil</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">spills</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">in the amazon and the valdez and the you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">gulf and whatever and all the wars over</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">oil and the destabilization of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">middle east forever and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">all of the global economy based on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">us petrodollar</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">and climate change itself and all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:37.040" style="s2">those issues are the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">success of solving the horseshit problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.040" end="00:46:42.560" style="s2">and because what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">for us to solve a problem we define the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.560" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">problem in a narrow way</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">right the the narrow problem is defined</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">one or two or five metrics so we want</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">the carriages to be able to go faster</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">with out the limitation of horses or</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">something right</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">and so we&#39;re working on a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">that narrowly defined problem but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">solution we create is going to interact</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">with the complexity of the actual world</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">in a lot of metrics that weren&#39;t part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">what we were designing to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">and so we didn&#39;t say also in as</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">environmentally sustainable way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">create oil spills and wars over oil and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">you know we weren&#39;t factoring those</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">but for the solution to really be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">solution to a problem it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">larger than the problem it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">able to overtake the problem and if it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">does overtake the problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">and it solves certain definitions of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">problem narrow definitions but that it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">interacts with the complex world</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">where it ends up externalizing harm in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">other areas but it&#39;s larger than the</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">original problem was those places where</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">it externalizes harm will probably be</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">or more complex and you know another way</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">of saying it is just</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">as humans develop more power we are just</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">shitty users of power currently right</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">um so that&#39;s coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">rivalrous thing but it&#39;s also coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">back to the even not rival risk just we</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t sense making well enough to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">if we&#39;re making a new piece of tech are</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">we making something</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">that even if we weren&#39;t doing it for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.280" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">rivalrous purpose isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">externalize harm because we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:15.599" style="s2">adequately considerate of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">not just defining the problem in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.599" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">narrow way but defining the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">embedding space</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">where we can make sure that our solution</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cause worse problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">and so this this is a fundamental change</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">not the nature of whether we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">to serve a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">rival risk goal but the nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">sense making to understand complexity</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">and to be able to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">embedding space of our solutions better</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">so this is another thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">generator function that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">address is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">define problems in such a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">solution to that problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">is actually omnipositive rather than</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">positive for something and damaging for</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just rival risk groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">it&#39;s also rivalrous metrics</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">right a metric based on theory of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">trade-offs where we benefit something</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">and harm a bunch of other things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">maybe things that we hadn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">anticipated</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">is going to create inexorable problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.040" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">especially as we&#39;re as powerful as we</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s one other generator function</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">i can get into but i feel like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">talked for a long time so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">maybe i&#39;ll take a break now and see if</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">framing things up this way</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">uh if you have any questions on it or</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">thoughts before we start to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">well what is emerging that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">yeah well let&#39;s let&#39;s wrap up the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">generator function</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">like list let&#39;s let&#39;s finish it and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">respond and we can explore what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">to emerge i think that will work well</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">so the last one briefly is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">the way we have made technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">is fundament fundamentally problematic</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">in and you&#39;ll notice all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">relate but</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">there are distinctions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">fundamentally problematic independent of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">how we use it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that tech is not good</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">or bad its value is neutral and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">whether we use</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">whether we use it in service of which</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">values we can use a hammer to build a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">house or to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">you know hit somebody as a weapon this</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">is not true</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">technology has in certain fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">and inexorable effects</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:24.839" style="s2">in its existence that we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">to factor</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.839" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">so inherent to increasing</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">power is you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">the nature of how embedded within a</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">rivalrous game theoretic dynamic it will</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">lead to the utilization of that power</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">for rivalrous purposes you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">not use it for rivalrous purposes inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">of those dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:52.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s how it relates to the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">first topic that&#39;s the multipolar trap</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.400" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">and where if if anyone uses it for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2"> up purpose everybody has to or</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">they lose by default</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">and we can&#39;t assume that other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to so we want first mover</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">advantage on using it for the up</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">right and but then als</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">also so technology embedded within a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">rivalrous context will get used for</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">adverse purposes</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">eat it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">then the tree can eat it and the and so</p>

<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">now as soon as we start mining and we</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">well that&#39;s a fundamental problem right</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">like so</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">either we have to make our built world</p>

<p begin="00:53:05.920" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">we have to figure out how to have</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">is a inherent toxicity independent of</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">right we can give a bunch of other</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">we try to use it for</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">and this has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">making things that are totally different</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">than the evolutionary</p>

<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">nature&#39;s complex systems also the</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">complex is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">the complex is anti-fragile you burn a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">forest it regrows</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">the complicated stuff that we build is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">fragile you burn a house down it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">regrow</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">and so as we are killing more and more</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">of the anti-fragility of nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:21.920" style="s2">and converting it into the</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">we&#39;re decreasing the anti-fragility of</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">the biosphere and making an increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">so this doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">have tech but it means we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">about it fundamentally differently we</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">have to think about it in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">considerate holistic way where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">thinking about what is intrinsically the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">entire effect across the entire</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">not just the really obvious effect of</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">and so again this requires a different</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">and sense-making capacity to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">so now when we look at all of the</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">i almost don&#39;t know what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">in me often of like helplessness because</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">now i see the problem and how big it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">how vast it is and how like</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">deeply it&#39;s encoded into the structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">of both the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">the system that i live in like my</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">civilization and even my own</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">but then like the work of just even</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:11.920" style="s2">reformatting my own</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">consciousness is like real real hard and</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.920" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">then i think oh and we have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:17.200" style="s2">for a lot of people and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">have to do it for</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.200" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">all the systems up and down the stack</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">whoa that&#39;s a like i i guess</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">what what comes from that is you know i</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re in a kind of unique</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">position and i almost just want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">you like</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">before we get into what you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">are you are you optimistic that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">gonna be able to like</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:47.280" style="s2">yeah so most of us have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">learned helplessness right</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">where we really want to help the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">homeless person that we&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">past we really actually don&#39;t feel good</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">about our busyness</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">to get to something that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.839" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">that much having us walk past another</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">human that&#39;s actually really hurting</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">and yet there&#39;s so many homeless people</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">and we could spend our whole life</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">doing it that way and not really touch</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">it and that&#39;s just one tiny issue and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:12.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a learned helplessness where</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel like i can keep caring</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.799" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">in the same way if i can&#39;t act on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">care it&#39;s too devastating</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">and so i start putting blinders on and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">start numbing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">in a particular way because i can only</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.160" style="s2">care about stuff i can do stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">and it seems like i can do so</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.160" end="00:58:34.559" style="s2">so both my impossibility to respond</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">and my impossibility to even make sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.559" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">of adequately well our my impossibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">to respond will have me turn sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">making off</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.599" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">also my and care off my inability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">even make</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.040" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">sense of things will have me turn care</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">off and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you a little bit about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">my process</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m sharing some things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve come to understand or how i see</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">things as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">you know somewhat long curve of really</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">trying to make sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">problems are in the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">but i started with much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">definition of the problems right it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">like it started for me that the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:23.359" style="s2">was factory farms</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">and then it expanded to know we actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.359" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">do up stuff to lots of animals</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">and then like and it kept expanding in</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">steps as i would work with it but at</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:33.440" style="s2">each step there was a devastation</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">of both how horrific and how huge the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">problem was</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">and then based on that sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">the care and then there was an</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">up leveling of okay well what could i do</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">to help this and a kind of agency that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">would emerge</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">but then as i would work with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:50.079" style="s2">solution that emerged i would realize it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.640" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a real solution because the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">problem was actually deeper and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">than i was thinking it was now solving</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">the wrong problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">so okay we&#39;re going to work and put the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:01.520" style="s2">fences around the elephant preserve so</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">the poachers can&#39;t get to them to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">protect the elephants</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">but given that even when we so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">succeed at that but we haven&#39;t addressed</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">the poverty of the poachers</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">who can&#39;t feed their kids any other way</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t addressed a macro economy</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">that creates poverty</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">because of a power law distribution on</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">wealth and we haven&#39;t created</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">affected the mindset towards animals and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">we haven&#39;t affected population dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:26.799" style="s2">and all those things and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">as a result when we succeed at</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">protecting the elephants because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">fences go up</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">the poachers move to start hunting the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">white rhino that&#39;s more endangered than</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">the mountain gorilla right this was an</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">actual experience i had when i was 13</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">activism project and i&#39;m like wow</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">the best solution because it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">understand the problem well enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">actually made a worse problem it moved</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">the harm to a more sensitive area</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">so then understand the larger definition</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.400" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">of the problem and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">try to work on a solution there and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">would happen again and so then that took</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">me on a process to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">kind of the maximum abstraction of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">generator functions of all the things</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">but at each step as there was a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">understanding of the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">problems there was a while before there</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">up leveling of a sense of agency now if</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:14.319" style="s2">i&#39;m going straight to the most</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:16.000" style="s2">abstract in general case there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.319" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">all those steps of the up leveling of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.000" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">agency and then there&#39;s going to be like</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:19.680" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2"> i went from thinking about what i</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.680" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">could do with a community garden</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:28.160" style="s2">to you know how do we</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">deal with the nature of how human sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.160" end="01:01:33.119" style="s2">make technology differently and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">rivalrous dynamics writ large globally</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.119" end="01:01:37.839" style="s2">and so something i can say</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">is like so part of my process this may</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.839" end="01:01:41.200" style="s2">or may not be relevant for anybody but</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.280" end="01:01:44.960" style="s2">part of my process was</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.200" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">in facing the actual situation of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.960" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">was there were a few vows that i made</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">when i was pretty young actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">teenager the first vowel was</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">that i would never turn away from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">pain of the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">like like decide i&#39;m not gonna um</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">go to the factory farm and i have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">opportunity or</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">avoid the poor area or turn off the peta</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">video that i wanted to actually see</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">the world that i lived in and what was</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.839" style="s2">be live in a blind bubble right</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">so that was the first vowel and then the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.839" end="01:02:22.240" style="s2">second vowel of course when you start to</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:24.480" style="s2">do that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.240" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">it&#39;s devastating and so then the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.480" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">next vowel was</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">to feel all of it and not go numb</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.079" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">and then the next vowel was to knock if</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">if not going numb</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:39.359" style="s2">not getting stuck in anger and blame</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:41.359" style="s2">and then the next vow is to also not get</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.359" end="01:02:43.359" style="s2">stuck in hopelessness or overwhelm</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.359" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">those were all basically unacceptable</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.359" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">so the first one of i just won&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">the problems i will live in a tiny</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.119" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">bubble where i get to feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">succeeding while there&#39;s massive</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:55.839" style="s2">suffering and torture happening is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">kind of dissociation that makes me as if</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.839" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">a sociopath right i&#39;m stoked</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">there&#39;s huge pain in the world but i</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have to care about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:04.799" style="s2">so i&#39;m like all right that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.799" end="01:03:09.280" style="s2">going numb getting stuck in blame or</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:10.400" style="s2">getting overwhelmed doesn&#39;t work so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.280" end="01:03:13.440" style="s2">like the only</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.400" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2"> way through is to say i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.440" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">feel it all i&#39;m gonna recognize</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:20.240" style="s2">that the devastation the anger whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">is a result of love which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">if i didn&#39;t love the animals if i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">love the kids if i didn&#39;t love the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">environment if it wasn&#39;t beautiful to me</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:27.520" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t care that it was being harmed</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">but underneath</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.520" end="01:03:30.880" style="s2">every one of underneath the fear the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:33.039" style="s2">anger everything</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.880" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">is a reality that is so beautiful that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">love which is why i care</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">so then i trace it back to the love and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">i feel that</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">and i also tune in not just to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">tragedies that are happening and could</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:47.119" style="s2">happen but also to the intrinsic beauty</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">and meaningfulness of life</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.119" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">and then i say okay i have some agency i</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">god&#39;s you know omnipotence but i have</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:59.119" style="s2">some agency</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">so what do i do with that agency</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.119" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">in service of what i care about and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.839" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">you know every time i</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.359" end="01:04:13.440" style="s2">meet a nurse who&#39;s who actually really</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">cares</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.440" end="01:04:17.599" style="s2">about the people that she&#39;s nursing and</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">makes the pain of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.599" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">experiencing when they go to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">hospital less painful has them feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">cared about</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">like i feel this i feel this</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">kind of existential relief that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:33.440" style="s2">or he&#39;s doing that and every time i find</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">someone who is</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.440" end="01:04:39.200" style="s2">tending to street dogs and tijuana</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">or anything even if it&#39;s not addressing</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.200" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">the generator functions of x-risk like</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">all those things matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.960" style="s2">and for a lot of people they will</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">understand the big picture</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.960" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">and they&#39;ll say i&#39;m glad some people are</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:52.240" style="s2">working on it i care about all of it but</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.319" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">based on the sense making i currently</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.240" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">and based on what i know how to do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:59.839" style="s2">is where i can actually add</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:00.319" style="s2">value and the last thing i would want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.839" end="01:05:02.319" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.319" end="01:05:03.680" style="s2">is have is have the nature of my</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.680" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">say because those actions aren&#39;t totally</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">sufficient for everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">that you would feel less motivated to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">take them no i want people to feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">deeply motivated to do the things that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:18.770" style="s2">they actually can do</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">that are expressions of their care</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">and some people will be oriented to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">kind of abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">to say well how would we build a new</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">resource provisioning system a new</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">economics that reverse</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:35.200" style="s2">that removes perverse incentive um or a</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">new collective intelligence system that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.200" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have some of the failings of our</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">existing governance systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:44.240" style="s2">and so the people who are called to</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.240" end="01:05:49.280" style="s2">and to systems like that awesome</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">i want you to work on those things but</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.280" end="01:05:52.160" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re called to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.160" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">need to happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:56.400" style="s2">and just because something doesn&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">the sufficiency doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.400" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">right there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:06.000" style="s2">and so you know these vows for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">i&#39;m sharing because they&#39;re ones that i</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.000" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">hope other people take</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">a version of their own version of which</p>

<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">how do i stay connected to what i care</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">about in the world and how do i</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">stay empowered in my relationship to</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">thank you for that that feels really</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">important uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:27.599" style="s2">to to to presence after uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">the work you did to to name the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">generator functions</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:37.359" style="s2">and yeah so now that we have that</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">ground covered conceptually uh what are</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.359" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">you seeing</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">that is emerging that is sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">perhaps to base a new civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.640" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">operating system on or however you want</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">to frame it yeah what are you seeing</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.839" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">in terms of things that are seeable</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.599" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">uh there&#39;s nothing that maps to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">sufficiency yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t progress</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">so do we see types of collective</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">intelligence processes</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:30.079" style="s2">that could solve problems without making</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">worse problems and types of resource</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.079" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">provisioning that could solve rivalrous</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:37.599" style="s2">dynamics at scale</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">no not yet do we at least see more</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.599" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:41.839" style="s2">understanding some of these dynamics and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:42.799" style="s2">taking them seriously in a way they</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.839" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.799" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">yes that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s emerging is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">actually just</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.480" style="s2">even a higher level of conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">consideration which is always going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.480" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">precede</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">the ability to address the things</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">emerging in that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.839" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">now you know if we look at things like</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">uh dow stack or back feed</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.440" end="01:08:09.359" style="s2">that&#39;s working on kind of dao based</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">governance structures</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.359" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">or um you know holochain or other</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">of the groups that are kind of at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">front end of the decentralized computing</p>

<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:23.679" style="s2">that resonate with me are resonating</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:28.400" style="s2">with other people i feel</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.679" end="01:14:29.360" style="s2">happy about that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.360" end="01:14:34.320" style="s2">something that i think about like when</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:34.320" style="s2">you&#39;re asking though what do we do</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.080" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">if we think about the psychology of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">people who have done</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:45.600" style="s2">fundamental pioneering and fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">invention and discovery they don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.600" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">get to ask anyone else how to do what</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:52.159" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:54.080" style="s2">right like that&#39;s intrinsic to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.159" end="01:14:57.040" style="s2">nature of figuring out new stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.080" end="01:14:58.480" style="s2">is that you can&#39;t ask anyone else how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.040" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">do it now that doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.480" end="01:15:02.400" style="s2">don&#39;t learn from</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">a tremendous amount of stuff and stand</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">on the shoulders of giants but then if</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:07.040" style="s2">you&#39;re newton you&#39;re standing on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.520" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">shoulders of giants you&#39;re making sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.040" end="01:15:10.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned those things</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:11.440" style="s2">but you&#39;re also then advancing the edge</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.320" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.440" end="01:15:14.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.239" end="01:15:19.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of psychology that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.640" end="01:15:22.560" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.520" end="01:15:25.679" style="s2">to be willing to work at something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.560" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">nobody can tell you how to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.679" end="01:15:31.120" style="s2">and that there&#39;s no precedent in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">history of smart people at figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.120" end="01:15:35.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s not hubris it&#39;s just a depth of</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.400" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">care that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.120" end="01:15:41.840" style="s2">can&#39;t turn away</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:42.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s like the i can&#39;t not focus</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.840" end="01:15:44.480" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">so even though i have no idea if i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.480" end="01:15:48.480" style="s2">succeed i still have to be working on it</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.560" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">and you know i think that</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:57.600" style="s2">growing up as kids most of us got most</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">of our praise</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.600" end="01:16:01.120" style="s2">from doing things that the authorities</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:03.120" style="s2">wanted us to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.120" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">and that had already been figured out so</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.120" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">we got the right answer to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:11.600" style="s2">to answers in sunday school that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">teachers had already</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.600" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">predetermined what the right answer was</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:17.120" style="s2">or in actual school where we figured out</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">how to spell our math or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.120" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">or winning a game where the rules of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">game were set or doing the chores where</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really have a say in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.719" style="s2">nature of how the house was designed or</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">and so we get all this praise for doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:31.920" style="s2">things that are already figured out</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:33.840" style="s2">that someone else tells us to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.920" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">and almost all the times we got punished</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.840" end="01:16:37.280" style="s2">were for doing something that we wanted</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.280" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a very deep psychological</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:43.760" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:45.840" style="s2">that is running that has to be unwound</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.760" end="01:16:47.520" style="s2">because that psychology is itself one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.840" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">the generator functions of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.520" end="01:16:51.600" style="s2">it keeps</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:55.199" style="s2">people perpetuating the existing systems</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.600" end="01:16:57.199" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.199" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">you know if someone asks me well what</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:17:00.320" style="s2">should i do</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">i&#39;m more interested in the meta question</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.320" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:06.560" style="s2">how do you i can share some things with</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">you and a number of people can share</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.560" end="01:17:11.360" style="s2">some things with you</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">but how do you navigate</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.360" end="01:17:16.080" style="s2">sovereignty in a way that says when i</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:18.480" style="s2">come to the edge of things that</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.080" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">aren&#39;t known how do i figure out what to</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:22.480" style="s2">do how do i discover</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">stuff as opposed to do stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.480" end="01:17:25.920" style="s2">somebody else told me is the thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:28.840" style="s2">like that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.920" end="01:17:31.120" style="s2">psychological shift there that is really</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.840" end="01:17:34.480" style="s2">critical so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.120" end="01:17:36.159" style="s2">and coming together with other people</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.480" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">that are also really</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.159" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">earnestly endeavoring to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">to do things that they care about that</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:42.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t currently known and figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">how to actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.640" end="01:17:47.440" style="s2">collaborate in that together so how to</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:49.040" style="s2">be in it ourself and how to collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.440" end="01:17:51.679" style="s2">with others in it</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.040" end="01:17:53.840" style="s2">and this requires it this actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.679" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">requires a mature relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.840" end="01:17:57.280" style="s2">with certainty and uncertainty where i</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:17:58.880" style="s2">can sit in</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:18:00.640" style="s2">uncertainty about something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.880" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">really consequential i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.640" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">solve the problems of the world yes it</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:04.960" style="s2">really matters i don&#39;t know how to solve</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:05.679" style="s2">even this particular problem yes it</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.960" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.679" end="01:18:10.640" style="s2">but i can sit in the uncertainty which</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">also means the uncomfort of it</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.640" end="01:18:14.000" style="s2">so that i don&#39;t just have to distract</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:16.320" style="s2">myself with something else</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.000" end="01:18:17.760" style="s2">or default to a quick answer that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.320" end="01:18:18.719" style="s2">wrong answer because i need some</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.760" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">certainty</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.719" end="01:18:23.679" style="s2">so there&#39;s a psychologic willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:24.880" style="s2">sit in the discomfort of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.679" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.880" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:29.679" style="s2">willingness to go through the epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.679" end="01:18:35.040" style="s2">to bring about enough certainty to act</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:37.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s easy for us to be very</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.040" end="01:18:38.960" style="s2">uncomfortable with uncertainty and want</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.360" end="01:18:41.679" style="s2">certainty fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.960" end="01:18:44.000" style="s2">of all kinds does that but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.679" end="01:18:46.080" style="s2">very easy for us to</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">to kind of do the post-modern move and</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.080" end="01:18:49.679" style="s2">be uncomfortable with any certainties</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:50.880" style="s2">and be sure that all certainty is</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.679" end="01:18:52.640" style="s2">imperialism</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.880" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">and only need to rest in uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.640" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">which means we never have an epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">basis for good choice</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:00.640" style="s2">and so a mature relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:02.320" style="s2">knows that there is knowable and</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.640" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">unknowable stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:05.679" style="s2">and within the knowable there&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:09.120" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.679" end="01:19:11.360" style="s2">and some known and that even the known</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.120" end="01:19:12.719" style="s2">my epistemic confidence margin is not a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.360" end="01:19:14.320" style="s2">hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.719" end="01:19:16.000" style="s2">and yet there are better confidence</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.320" end="01:19:16.800" style="s2">margins than others as a basis for</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:19.040" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.800" end="01:19:21.520" style="s2">and a mature relationship to all that</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.040" end="01:19:23.760" style="s2">says that i can sit with uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.520" end="01:19:25.120" style="s2">and i can sit with certainty both</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.760" end="01:19:26.640" style="s2">comfortably</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.120" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">emotionally so that i&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.640" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">emotionally biased one way or the other</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.800" end="01:19:34.320" style="s2">and i can explore what is the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:36.239" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.320" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">to bring about a particular confidence</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.239" end="01:19:43.360" style="s2">margin for the certainty to act</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">i think that people who haven&#39;t received</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.360" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">attention often</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:53.840" style="s2">misassess how uncomfortable it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">um and miss assess that it&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.840" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">be fun</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:20:00.719" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">you know i i had whatever wounded</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.719" end="01:20:05.360" style="s2">childhood dynamics that</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:06.000" style="s2">created insecurity that sought external</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.360" end="01:20:09.040" style="s2">approval</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:11.040" style="s2">like everybody does and figured out my</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.040" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">what i can be good at to get approval</p>
