<p begin="00:00:01.440" end="00:00:12.100" style="s2">okay yeah it&#39;s I think the gradual</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.740" end="00:00:13.990" style="s2">moving into and realization of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.100" end="00:00:16.150" style="s2">different modes of dialogue is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.990" end="00:00:19.480" style="s2">that&#39;s very very interesting and I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.150" end="00:00:23.380" style="s2">something that is fascinating you at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.480" end="00:00:25.780" style="s2">moment and I see it at tying in deeply</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.380" end="00:00:27.670" style="s2">to the series awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.780" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">crisis and particularly of course the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.670" end="00:00:34.780" style="s2">sort of response aspect of how we come</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:37.329" style="s2">to terms with and ultimately move</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.780" end="00:00:41.829" style="s2">through ameliorate as you put it that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.329" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">perennial problems we face mm-hmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.829" end="00:00:48.120" style="s2">log is one of many modes of expression</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">experience response that we might take</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.260" end="00:01:03.969" style="s2">to these perennial problems and and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:06.759" style="s2">was trying to trying to feel back in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.969" end="00:01:17.679" style="s2">sort of drop in to where where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.759" end="00:01:20.619" style="s2">now yeah I&#39;ve been engaging we do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.679" end="00:01:22.420" style="s2">series a lot to the last few days and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.619" end="00:01:23.740" style="s2">thank you yeah I&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.420" end="00:01:25.719" style="s2">listening to you on occasion</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.740" end="00:01:28.299" style="s2">double-time so I&#39;m hoping that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.719" end="00:01:30.189" style="s2">conversation will be a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.299" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">for you to follow along as funny venues</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.189" end="00:01:34.299" style="s2">but when you flip back from double time</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:36.819" style="s2">to singular Mike hello it feels so slow</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.299" end="00:01:40.869" style="s2">for a few seconds yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.819" end="00:01:42.189" style="s2">okay but it&#39;s the double time was was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.869" end="00:01:44.079" style="s2">literally just to get through some</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.189" end="00:01:46.419" style="s2">things I thought I need to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.079" end="00:01:49.569" style="s2">that there are key pieces I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.419" end="00:01:51.369" style="s2">out on here before we saw em and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.569" end="00:01:54.279" style="s2">definitely prefer that the single tone</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.369" end="00:01:57.969" style="s2">version of it and you know John it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.279" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a challenging thing and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.969" end="00:02:04.659" style="s2">might bring us to a point of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:06.639" style="s2">articulating some of the productive</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.659" end="00:02:08.229" style="s2">nature of dialogue but also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.639" end="00:02:11.950" style="s2">conditions which sort of have to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.229" end="00:02:13.510" style="s2">present to engage in it because what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.950" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">feeling right now just to speak on my</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.510" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:22.180" style="s2">is a mixture of extreme gratitude for</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">the opportunity to dialogue with you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.180" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">also feeling the tremendous breadth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:34.570" style="s2">the whole series and an interest to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:36.670" style="s2">speak to that dynamic and context so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.570" end="00:02:40.570" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got as much as we possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.670" end="00:02:43.000" style="s2">can have on the table between us so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.570" end="00:02:46.300" style="s2">we can in some sense both together</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.000" end="00:02:48.850" style="s2">orient towards what might be of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.300" end="00:02:50.260" style="s2">mutual interest to explore and so much</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.850" end="00:02:54.700" style="s2">of what you explore I find deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.260" end="00:02:58.860" style="s2">important and and crucial for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.700" end="00:03:02.200" style="s2">personally to gain further insight and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.860" end="00:03:04.270" style="s2">familiarity with so that I can in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">collaboration with others build the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.270" end="00:03:13.780" style="s2">kinds of communities and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">experiences that facilitate some of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.780" end="00:03:20.709" style="s2">deep development that is part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:22.269" style="s2">of meeting and responding to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.709" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">crisis and so there&#39;s all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.269" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">breadth and then there&#39;s at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">time when it comes to dialogue a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:31.930" style="s2">sense of a certain sense of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">smoothness and being just where we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.930" end="00:03:39.850" style="s2">and and so in some meta way I this is me</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:43.600" style="s2">I suppose expressing to you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.850" end="00:03:47.950" style="s2">of where I am which is gradually feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.600" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">into a way in here and so if I draw into</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.870" end="00:04:01.870" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.830" end="00:04:06.440" style="s2">where do you feel this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.540" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.440" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a Socratic dialogue but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">also I sense a bit more of an intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">to what you&#39;re exploring could you uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:20.600" style="s2">could you articulate how that is alive</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:25.850" style="s2">for you at the moment and how you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.600" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">that this may be an important practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.850" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">to situate within our ecology of ways we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">can develop and ameliorate and move</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">through some of the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:41.690" style="s2">we face as existential beings oh great I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:43.760" style="s2">think that&#39;s an excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.690" end="00:04:44.650" style="s2">before I address the question I first</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.760" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">want to respond</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.650" end="00:04:53.419" style="s2">I really appreciated your careful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.639" style="s2">that in a very positive sense you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.419" end="00:04:57.889" style="s2">very careful articulation of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.639" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">framing the framing you&#39;re bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.889" end="00:05:04.760" style="s2">bear into this interaction I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:07.580" style="s2">that was a very very helpful thing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.760" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">me and I think also very very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.580" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">for potential listeners so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">to say thank you for doing that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.210" end="00:05:16.070" style="s2">taking the time that&#39;s in my mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:17.599" style="s2">analogous to the importance I give to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.070" end="00:05:19.340" style="s2">problem formulation it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.599" end="00:05:21.380" style="s2">dialogue formulation how are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.340" end="00:05:23.990" style="s2">formulating the dialogue before we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.380" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">immediately leap in and try to solve or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.990" end="00:05:27.580" style="s2">resolve or whatever we&#39;re gonna do in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:31.070" style="s2">the dialogue spending that time to first</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">formulate the dialogue explicate it make</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.070" end="00:05:35.990" style="s2">sure that we share we have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">commitment to this formulation so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.990" end="00:05:39.830" style="s2">think that right but I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:41.180" style="s2">exemplary thing you just did so I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.830" end="00:05:43.070" style="s2">to commend you on that I want to express</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.180" end="00:05:45.110" style="s2">my appreciation for that in both senses</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.070" end="00:05:47.900" style="s2">of the word like the gratitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.110" end="00:05:51.229" style="s2">understanding for why you did that so</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.900" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">thank you very much for that and that of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.229" end="00:05:55.460" style="s2">course is a nice segue into your</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">question the question that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.460" end="00:06:01.240" style="s2">actually posed to me huh so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:06.729" style="s2">bit of the genealogy of how it emerged</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:08.949" style="s2">and and then it will give me a way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.729" end="00:06:11.069" style="s2">getting a little bit better where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.949" end="00:06:14.440" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.069" end="00:06:17.110" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been I mean in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.440" end="00:06:18.159" style="s2">the awakening from the meaning crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:20.159" style="s2">course I&#39;ve been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.159" end="00:06:24.210" style="s2">this need for an ecology practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.159" end="00:06:26.500" style="s2">ecology practices you know setting up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.210" end="00:06:30.270" style="s2">counterbalancing self-organizing systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.500" end="00:06:33.069" style="s2">of cyclic tech in order to as you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.270" end="00:06:34.870" style="s2">ameliorate the printing of problems and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.069" end="00:06:37.780" style="s2">perhaps also enhance and afford</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.870" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">increased sense of senses of connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.780" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">to oneself to other people to the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:46.360" style="s2">all of that and I was in I wanted a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:49.060" style="s2">partial another motive for this has also</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.360" end="00:06:50.349" style="s2">give appropriate credit and it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.060" end="00:06:53.139" style="s2">not just a moral thing I&#39;m doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.349" end="00:06:55.629" style="s2">trying to also show the role the vital</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.139" end="00:06:57.219" style="s2">role of distributed cognition in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.629" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">work we&#39;re doing that often gets masked</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.219" end="00:07:02.020" style="s2">by kind of individualistic ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:04.659" style="s2">I want to challenge not only what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.020" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">saying but in what I&#39;m exemplifying so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.659" end="00:07:12.069" style="s2">was in one of these kinds of discussions</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:14.139" style="s2">with somebody who I&#39;ve who&#39;s I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.069" end="00:07:17.949" style="s2">to have a lot of affection for a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.139" end="00:07:20.110" style="s2">appreciation for Jordan Hall Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.949" end="00:07:21.849" style="s2">especially important for the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.110" end="00:07:23.650" style="s2">which he converses I&#39;m not saying he</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.849" end="00:07:25.719" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have great ideas he does he has</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.650" end="00:07:28.150" style="s2">great insights but people tend to focus</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.719" end="00:07:30.370" style="s2">a little too rapidly on content and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.150" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">pay enough attention to the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.370" end="00:07:33.430" style="s2">doing all this really important work</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">again around</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.430" end="00:07:37.719" style="s2">the manner and the formulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">dialogue so I was in discussion with him</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.719" end="00:07:42.909" style="s2">and I was trying to get at his notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:44.139" style="s2">coherence we&#39;re comparing it yeah and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.909" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">had this insight he said well what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.139" end="00:07:49.029" style="s2">think I&#39;m pointing towards is the need</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:52.419" style="s2">for a meta psycho technology whose role</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.029" end="00:07:56.229" style="s2">it is is to help generate curate and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.419" end="00:07:57.639" style="s2">organize the the the ecology of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.229" end="00:08:00.190" style="s2">technology so I used this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.639" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">metaphor of shepherding I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.190" end="00:08:03.819" style="s2">something that Shepherds it and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:05.590" style="s2">thought and I that just struck me as oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.819" end="00:08:07.659" style="s2">wow that&#39;s a that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.590" end="00:08:08.949" style="s2">brilliant insight and it was in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.659" end="00:08:11.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between our</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.949" end="00:08:14.289" style="s2">individuals cultivate wisdom and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.409" end="00:08:17.619" style="s2">know and then write this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.289" end="00:08:19.809" style="s2">needed meta psycho technology so then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.619" end="00:08:22.029" style="s2">got thinking and then I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.809" end="00:08:24.189" style="s2">the ancient world had something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.029" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">analogous to this which was the practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.189" end="00:08:28.719" style="s2">of dialectic which came out of Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:31.029" style="s2">and Linkous and it ramifies through</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.719" end="00:08:32.709" style="s2">Plato and then it goes at all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.029" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">important directions in them Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.709" end="00:08:37.060" style="s2">a tradition now the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:38.620" style="s2">dialectic and if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.060" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">neoplatonist it&#39;s very clear that it had</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.620" end="00:08:42.190" style="s2">this status of being a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:44.860" style="s2">technology it is sort of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.190" end="00:08:47.560" style="s2">practice you do so you know how to best</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.860" end="00:08:49.209" style="s2">do the other practices and curate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.560" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">coordinate them together and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.209" end="00:08:53.139" style="s2">interesting thing about the dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:55.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s both something you do as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.139" end="00:08:57.370" style="s2">individual sort of ontologically and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:08:59.740" style="s2">then something you do with other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.370" end="00:09:01.569" style="s2">discursively and that these are these</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.740" end="00:09:04.389" style="s2">two dimensions are integrated in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.569" end="00:09:06.850" style="s2">powerful way so well all I&#39;m saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.389" end="00:09:08.649" style="s2">well I should I should better understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.850" end="00:09:10.509" style="s2">that because that would serve as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.649" end="00:09:12.310" style="s2">valuable template for trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.509" end="00:09:14.079" style="s2">understand what what Jordan was talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.310" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">about and that and and it was of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.079" end="00:09:17.290" style="s2">deeply enmeshed with the wisdom project</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:20.620" style="s2">which was the connection I was seeking</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.290" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">so then I thought oh that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.620" end="00:09:25.329" style="s2">interesting because that also ties in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:27.010" style="s2">with this stuff that&#39;s also been</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.329" end="00:09:29.550" style="s2">happening you can see it up for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.010" end="00:09:32.529" style="s2">on rebel wisdom about the rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.550" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">the power of the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.529" end="00:09:36.579" style="s2">that is generated by districted</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:39.339" style="s2">cognition and you know there&#39;s now some</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.579" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">you know even some hard science it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.339" end="00:09:43.959" style="s2">little bit some of its ghastly about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">power of distributed cognition like</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.959" end="00:09:48.279" style="s2">they&#39;ve directly linked brain a rat</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:50.290" style="s2">brains together and and and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.279" end="00:09:52.089" style="s2">collectivity can solve problems that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.290" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">individual rats can&#39;t solve with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.089" end="00:09:56.079" style="s2">computational power all right right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:57.399" style="s2">then there&#39;s all the stuff about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.079" end="00:09:58.750" style="s2">brain synchrony between human beings I</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.399" end="00:10:00.550" style="s2">won&#39;t get into the nuts and bolts of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.750" end="00:10:03.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s all this emerging stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.550" end="00:10:05.230" style="s2">then I thought oh and then I and then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.850" end="00:10:07.660" style="s2">got to meet somebody else who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.230" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">forming a very deep friendship with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.660" end="00:10:11.230" style="s2">just talk to him guys in stock and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.870" style="s2">know at the so there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.230" end="00:10:15.550" style="s2">emerging cyclic technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.870" end="00:10:18.009" style="s2">especially guys circling</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.550" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">because guys circling is so impregnated</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.009" end="00:10:21.430" style="s2">with the wisdom project of high</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.319" style="s2">daguerreian and existential philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.430" end="00:10:26.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.319" end="00:10:28.060" style="s2">right I&#39;m talking about as something</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.380" end="00:10:30.250" style="s2">that has analogous elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.060" end="00:10:31.780" style="s2">with ancient dialectic so I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.250" end="00:10:35.740" style="s2">been engaging with the help of peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.780" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">lindbergh and the wonderful people in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.740" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">my circling group so i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.700" end="00:10:42.790" style="s2">participant observation learning some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">these other discourse modalities did</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.790" end="00:10:48.190" style="s2">some empathy circling recently uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:49.840" style="s2">that video doing some insight that do</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.190" end="00:10:53.830" style="s2">some insight anyways learning all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.840" end="00:10:56.680" style="s2">these things and so it struck need that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.830" end="00:10:58.380" style="s2">dialectic was also the machinery in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.680" end="00:11:01.390" style="s2">ancient world by which people were</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.380" end="00:11:03.970" style="s2">tailoring themselves to and entering</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.390" end="00:11:06.520" style="s2">into right the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.970" end="00:11:09.460" style="s2">of distributed cognition and they often</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.520" end="00:11:11.530" style="s2">spoke of this in religious terms what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.460" end="00:11:13.750" style="s2">really interesting to me when I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.530" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2">circling practice for example is how</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.750" end="00:11:19.240" style="s2">spontaneously people often from a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.820" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">secular orientation will will thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.240" end="00:11:22.600" style="s2">will find themselves using very</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">spiritual even religious terms to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.600" end="00:11:26.710" style="s2">about the phenomenology and the change</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:29.860" style="s2">and functionality that&#39;s occurring in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.710" end="00:11:32.260" style="s2">these practices so I just saw that as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.860" end="00:11:34.690" style="s2">massive convergence I saw okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.260" end="00:11:36.370" style="s2">all this stuff going on about collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.690" end="00:11:38.200" style="s2">intelligence and distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.370" end="00:11:39.850" style="s2">here&#39;s ancient dialectic and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.200" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">these new and wonderful texts being</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.850" end="00:11:44.830" style="s2">generated around this like sera sera a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:47.500" style="s2">rapid book on Socrates for example is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.830" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">just amazing and they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">there&#39;s that the coordination with</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:52.900" style="s2">Jordans idea about the meta psychic</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:55.090" style="s2">technology and and then they&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.900" end="00:11:58.900" style="s2">said it struck me that well what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.090" end="00:12:00.640" style="s2">could do is we could and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.900" end="00:12:03.160" style="s2">gonna do in the next series we could</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.640" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">explore right now all these current</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.160" end="00:12:08.080" style="s2">emerging biological practices put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">into dialogue and I don&#39;t mean that as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.080" end="00:12:13.000" style="s2">pun I mean that as a real thing put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:15.640" style="s2">into dialogue with what I can get what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.000" end="00:12:18.010" style="s2">could get glean from an garner for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.640" end="00:12:19.570" style="s2">practice of ancient dialectic and see if</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.010" end="00:12:21.550" style="s2">we can then bring you know some</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.570" end="00:12:24.820" style="s2">elucidation some clarification some</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.550" end="00:12:26.770" style="s2">insight some advancement of the project</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.820" end="00:12:28.450" style="s2">because here&#39;s here&#39;s that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.770" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">key idea just like individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.450" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">intelligence needs to be exhausted up</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:34.390" style="s2">into rationality and then that exact it</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:36.760" style="s2">up into wisdom we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.390" end="00:12:39.190" style="s2">collective intelligence and ratchet that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.760" end="00:12:41.320" style="s2">up into collective rationality and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.190" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">connective wisdom collective wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.320" end="00:12:44.680" style="s2">those two pride</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:47.170" style="s2">deeply interpenetrating and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.680" end="00:12:49.690" style="s2">what I think we need in order to get to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">you the meta secular technology so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.690" end="00:12:53.410" style="s2">doing a lot of work with Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">master Pietro by the way you should have</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.410" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">him on your you should have muted</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.790" end="00:12:59.860" style="s2">interview Chris right I so Chris and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:01.720" style="s2">are writing a chapter for the meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.860" end="00:13:04.680" style="s2">modern anthology on just the stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.720" end="00:13:07.870" style="s2">were talking about it&#39;s also going into</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.680" end="00:13:09.220" style="s2">the book we&#39;re working on so there so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.870" end="00:13:11.500" style="s2">I&#39;m doing a lot of work with Chris right</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.220" end="00:13:12.790" style="s2">now to try and nail down some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.500" end="00:13:15.730" style="s2">theory and doing a lot of work with</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.790" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">Peter on the impunity Limburg investing</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:53.380" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m sort of getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.089" end="00:13:54.970" style="s2">very excited right now because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.380" end="00:13:59.319" style="s2">lot of excitement I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.970" end="00:14:04.449" style="s2">of I think there&#39;s a lot of real</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.319" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">potential here to to create to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.449" end="00:14:10.120" style="s2">to help in advance this kind of meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.420" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">psycho technology and access ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.120" end="00:14:14.889" style="s2">collective rationality and collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">wisdom so that we have something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.889" end="00:14:19.810" style="s2">can really vet our attempts to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">the ecology of practices that are needed</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.810" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">to address and ameliorate the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">crisis so that&#39;s sort of a gist of and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:29.170" style="s2">and I asked for forbearance from all</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">your listeners and your viewers because</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.170" end="00:14:32.860" style="s2">this is very much a work in progress</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:35.290" style="s2">it&#39;s just um something I&#39;m you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.860" end="00:14:36.939" style="s2">doing work on now trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.290" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">phenomenology and the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.939" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">all of this worked out but this is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">this is where it&#39;s at like yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:45.759" style="s2">beautiful John thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:48.180" style="s2">that answer that was that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.759" end="00:14:48.180" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.430" end="00:14:55.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very exciting I feel that same</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.010" end="00:14:59.970" style="s2">sense of of interest and excitement</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.320" end="00:15:01.890" style="s2">about it and will continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.970" end="00:15:04.080" style="s2">gathering with people here both in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.890" end="00:15:07.140" style="s2">person online and then around the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.080" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">in person eventually when I get off and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.140" end="00:15:13.200" style="s2">away from here for just a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:17.610" style="s2">be doing exactly that it&#39;s some attempt</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.200" end="00:15:20.370" style="s2">to move into insight practice in a co</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.610" end="00:15:25.050" style="s2">participatory way this this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.370" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">movement towards presencing wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.050" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">that ultimately in which in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:35.880" style="s2">we are already bringing to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:37.260" style="s2">presencing in our own lives to get by in</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.880" end="00:15:39.150" style="s2">the world this set of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.260" end="00:15:41.820" style="s2">technologies that are already in play</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.150" end="00:15:44.340" style="s2">the ones that are already emerging so is</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.820" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">it a fair formulation to think about a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.340" end="00:15:52.790" style="s2">meta psycho technology as the continual</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:57.180" style="s2">renewal establishment and renewal of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.790" end="00:15:59.010" style="s2">participatory wisdom oh I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.180" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">an excellent way of putting it I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.010" end="00:16:02.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s participatory in both if</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.290" end="00:16:04.710" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.310" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">horizontal between people and vertical</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.710" end="00:16:10.500" style="s2">within a person because there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.470" end="00:16:12.420" style="s2">if with if this if this machinery isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.500" end="00:16:14.010" style="s2">already to some degree active in you you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.420" end="00:16:14.700" style="s2">need it to start to get into it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">like a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.700" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">if you it&#39;s like you need the right you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.280" style="s2">need a bit of honesty to cultivate more</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:22.380" style="s2">of honesty and then sort of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.280" end="00:16:26.070" style="s2">need that germinating spark kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.380" end="00:16:27.780" style="s2">so I think you all altima Tino this kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.070" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">of wisdom by participating in it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.780" end="00:16:32.130" style="s2">then like you said it&#39;s very much also</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:32.940" style="s2">and this is what this is what has such</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.130" end="00:16:35.460" style="s2">some of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.940" end="00:16:37.800" style="s2">phenomenological effects on people that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">sense of that&#39;s why it&#39;s often called</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.800" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">the we face the participation in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.960" end="00:16:45.720" style="s2">right some emerging emergent thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">emergent presence I&#39;ve got to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:48.810" style="s2">with my language because I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.910" style="s2">invoke you know weird a weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.810" end="00:16:53.370" style="s2">metaphysics but you get this you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.910" end="00:16:55.770" style="s2">this wheeze face that is not reducible</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.370" end="00:16:58.830" style="s2">to any one particular individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.770" end="00:17:00.600" style="s2">cognition and so and your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.830" end="00:17:01.230" style="s2">to it one is one a participation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.600" end="00:17:03.240" style="s2">not other</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.230" end="00:17:06.690" style="s2">than you but it&#39;s not identical to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.240" end="00:17:09.900" style="s2">you participate in it and it&#39;s I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.690" end="00:17:12.660" style="s2">mean and again that&#39;s why it hurt khun&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.900" end="00:17:14.250" style="s2">back to you know sort of theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.660" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">language it&#39;s I mean and it even</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.250" end="00:17:17.670" style="s2">survives in some of her metaphors we</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">talk about team spirit well at one point</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.670" end="00:17:22.470" style="s2">that was really a phenomenological thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:24.540" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just sort of Yoho right it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.470" end="00:17:26.190" style="s2">us and right so when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.540" end="00:17:28.050" style="s2">doing something like circling you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.190" end="00:17:30.120" style="s2">you get that but it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.050" end="00:17:34.740" style="s2">metaphor for our shared commitment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.120" end="00:17:37.260" style="s2">the extent aesthetic experience of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.740" end="00:17:40.620" style="s2">know of the dynamical system that has</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.260" end="00:17:42.540" style="s2">taken shape between all the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.620" end="00:17:45.960" style="s2">involved and and that and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:50.460" style="s2">the power it has to alter and shift</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.960" end="00:17:53.370" style="s2">individual cognition so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.460" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">that that that it&#39;s a it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.370" end="00:17:57.420" style="s2">participatory in both within you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:17:58.980" style="s2">have to read you like you have to be it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.420" end="00:18:02.130" style="s2">you can&#39;t just think about it you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.980" end="00:18:03.720" style="s2">to embody it and then it&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:06.510" style="s2">participatory in that you have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.720" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">relationship to the we face all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.510" end="00:18:11.580" style="s2">the that is again it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:14.040" style="s2">other and it&#39;s not me it&#39;s not I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.580" end="00:18:15.570" style="s2">it&#39;s we so it&#39;s deeply its its</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.040" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">phenomenology is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.570" end="00:18:21.870" style="s2">participatory in nature mmm-hmm and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:23.370" style="s2">as you said what that&#39;s all directed</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.870" end="00:18:25.080" style="s2">towards and what I want to even more</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.370" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">direct it towards with the help of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.080" end="00:18:31.380" style="s2">people like Jordan and guy and Chris is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:34.800" style="s2">as you said towards the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.380" end="00:18:36.300" style="s2">collective cultivation of wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.800" end="00:18:38.300" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s the subtitle so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.300" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the next series is after Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.300" end="00:18:46.920" style="s2">the pursuit of wisdom through authentic</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:50.690" style="s2">dialogue mmhmm yeah yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.920" end="00:18:50.690" style="s2">battle seems right to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.709" end="00:19:04.959" style="s2">so I wonder if this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.119" end="00:19:08.169" style="s2">way in because okay okay so so in one</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.959" end="00:19:09.999" style="s2">sense it seems like where we are to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.169" end="00:19:13.929" style="s2">in dialogue which neither of us know</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.999" end="00:19:16.629" style="s2">right now is in some sense is some sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.929" end="00:19:19.539" style="s2">emergent and in another sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.629" end="00:19:22.659" style="s2">latent already in each of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.539" end="00:19:26.919" style="s2">individually our current maps of making</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.659" end="00:19:28.749" style="s2">sense of things and also our orientation</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.919" end="00:19:31.239" style="s2">and way we are willing to be that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.749" end="00:19:34.209" style="s2">show up and embody that right to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.239" end="00:19:36.099" style="s2">continuous between that propositional</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.209" end="00:19:38.229" style="s2">and participatory level went to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.099" end="00:19:39.879" style="s2">extent we can generate the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.229" end="00:19:41.589" style="s2">knowing so we can both participate in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.879" end="00:19:44.379" style="s2">that to the extent I have the words</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.589" end="00:19:50.219" style="s2">right in to procedurally be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.379" end="00:19:53.829" style="s2">that as well we are we are here at this</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.219" end="00:19:56.019" style="s2">opening and I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.829" end="00:19:59.469" style="s2">present a little bit about where I feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.019" end="00:20:01.059" style="s2">myself ultimately going and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.469" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">mean we have to go there right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.059" end="00:20:04.749" style="s2">there&#39;s this as this balance sighs</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:07.359" style="s2">there&#39;s this balance that it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.749" end="00:20:10.229" style="s2">to hold isn&#39;t it between the being one</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.359" end="00:20:13.479" style="s2">way of being where we are and being and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.229" end="00:20:16.419" style="s2">ultimately actually my my fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.479" end="00:20:18.759" style="s2">goal here is to be helpful in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.419" end="00:20:21.129" style="s2">collaborative way towards that very</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.759" end="00:20:23.859" style="s2">project and and I would actually love to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.129" end="00:20:27.669" style="s2">talk to you about how that project</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.669" end="00:20:31.359" style="s2">show up in the world and broadly</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:34.029" style="s2">speaking these collaborations toward the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.359" end="00:20:37.959" style="s2">creation of communities that enable</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.029" end="00:20:39.909" style="s2">wisdom enable the development of psycho</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.909" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">psycho technologies based on the</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:47.469" style="s2">towards that in their life and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.149" end="00:20:49.269" style="s2">realize a deeper connection to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.469" end="00:20:50.829" style="s2">themselves each other and the world well</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.269" end="00:20:52.379" style="s2">we also make sense of where we&#39;re at in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.829" end="00:20:57.239" style="s2">our collective moment for me this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.379" end="00:21:01.479" style="s2">absolutely essential and serving that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.239" end="00:21:02.979" style="s2">what my primary aim is yet that is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.479" end="00:21:04.029" style="s2">that is something that&#39;s it&#39;s a live</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.979" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">project and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.029" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">we have the moment of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">I have my individual places of where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:16.269" style="s2">at with considering for example some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:19.179" style="s2">the deeper metaphysical aspects to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.269" end="00:21:21.159" style="s2">theorizing because your theorizing has</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.179" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">been so important to me you&#39;re a key</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.159" end="00:21:26.859" style="s2">influencer of mine because of me for</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:29.379" style="s2">many beautiful ways it&#39;s we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.859" end="00:21:31.299" style="s2">time to talk about it precisely today</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.379" end="00:21:34.090" style="s2">and so there&#39;s all of these aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.299" end="00:21:36.309" style="s2">myself that in some sense are desiring</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.090" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">zuv presents themselves yet there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.309" end="00:21:40.899" style="s2">threat that if I tend to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:44.019" style="s2">is also one that can be between us that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.899" end="00:21:46.419" style="s2">is mutually interesting and revelatory</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.019" end="00:21:48.309" style="s2">for both of us I think what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.419" end="00:21:50.289" style="s2">right now is already extremely helpful</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.309" end="00:21:52.089" style="s2">so the interesting one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.289" end="00:21:54.669" style="s2">interesting dimensions I call it the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.089" end="00:21:56.679" style="s2">theory a theory dimension so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.669" end="00:22:00.070" style="s2">things we&#39;re doing in this practice is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.679" end="00:22:01.330" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly moving right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.070" end="00:22:03.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.330" end="00:22:04.450" style="s2">attention and respect I will knowing or</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.159" end="00:22:07.330" style="s2">shifting right but we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.450" end="00:22:09.549" style="s2">moving between theory in which we</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.330" end="00:22:11.950" style="s2">advance propositional arguments right</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.549" end="00:22:13.629" style="s2">and then but then then we do what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.950" end="00:22:15.539" style="s2">just did we step back into the-- Oriya</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.629" end="00:22:18.070" style="s2">which is we step back into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.539" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">contemplative frame in which we&#39;re again</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.070" end="00:22:22.659" style="s2">ok where are we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">what&#39;s the agent arena you know set up</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.659" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">here how are we formulating the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:28.749" style="s2">and then what we&#39;re doing there is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:30.580" style="s2">trying to come alive - we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.749" end="00:22:32.589" style="s2">increase our sensitivity and transform</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.580" end="00:22:35.259" style="s2">our Sensibility so we can sense the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.589" end="00:22:36.729" style="s2">Cairo&#39;s so we can sense like the way in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.259" end="00:22:38.349" style="s2">which this is shifting and directing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.729" end="00:22:39.729" style="s2">there&#39;s so much finesse here if there I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.349" end="00:22:42.460" style="s2">talk about it almost like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.729" end="00:22:44.289" style="s2">musicality and you&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.460" end="00:22:46.299" style="s2">rhythm you&#39;re trying to sense the tone</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.289" end="00:22:49.719" style="s2">and so you have to you have to currently</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.299" end="00:22:51.489" style="s2">shift into the OREA - sense and also you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.719" end="00:22:53.229" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s not just a sentencing</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.489" end="00:22:54.549" style="s2">thing there&#39;s an aspiration thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.229" end="00:22:56.830" style="s2">also you&#39;re also training your</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.549" end="00:22:58.330" style="s2">sensibility like music appreciation so</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.830" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.330" end="00:23:03.219" style="s2">transforming your sensibility to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">on the musicality of the dialogue so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.219" end="00:23:08.619" style="s2">that when you come back in it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:10.299" style="s2">you and the other person both of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.619" end="00:23:12.580" style="s2">like are sharing this commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.299" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging between you so first of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.580" end="00:23:17.780" style="s2">all I think what you just did about</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:19.730" style="s2">right and and so I think I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.780" end="00:23:21.350" style="s2">a vital and I&#39;m using that word to try</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.730" end="00:23:23.480" style="s2">and resonate with as many meanings</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.350" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">impossible with it I think what you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.480" end="00:23:28.010" style="s2">did is a vital thing that that theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:30.020" style="s2">Theory has shift and I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.010" end="00:23:32.660" style="s2">Jordan about this I would see and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.020" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">and about how it&#39;s about sensitizing but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.660" end="00:23:36.950" style="s2">also transforming sensibility to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:38.750" style="s2">on the musicality I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.950" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">just like I think that&#39;s actually is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.750" end="00:23:43.270" style="s2">vital to what we&#39;re trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:46.730" style="s2">right now and it&#39;s important therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.270" end="00:23:48.920" style="s2">it for people who are interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.730" end="00:23:51.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.920" end="00:23:54.470" style="s2">this exemplification and not just the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.920" end="00:23:56.810" style="s2">the explicit content of our propositions</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.470" end="00:23:59.180" style="s2">so I think that that was a bit that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.810" end="00:24:00.380" style="s2">a very that that for me that see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.180" end="00:24:01.880" style="s2">the kind of thing I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.380" end="00:24:05.900" style="s2">right now I&#39;m trying to get at like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.880" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">what&#39;s in practice what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:10.190" style="s2">transformations of the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.880" end="00:24:12.890" style="s2">that tell us something about how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.190" end="00:24:16.370" style="s2">access and transform the funk underlying</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.890" end="00:24:19.160" style="s2">functionality and and so just here just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.370" end="00:24:21.980" style="s2">now you doing that in fact you did it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.160" end="00:24:24.620" style="s2">spontaneously and so well is it exact</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.980" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">exactly the kind of thing that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:32.660" style="s2">interested in and and I think is as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:34.970" style="s2">say vital to trying to to get this the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.660" end="00:24:37.790" style="s2">idea and even the metaphor you had of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.970" end="00:24:39.230" style="s2">the thread is so good because right</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.790" end="00:24:42.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which you know you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.230" end="00:24:45.110" style="s2">have you have to you to really play with</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.740" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">salience to in the midst of all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.110" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">other things to find the thread and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:50.540" style="s2">then there&#39;s a kind of diligence and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:54.530" style="s2">respect that you have to set yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.540" end="00:24:56.840" style="s2">into to to follow the thread so yes I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.530" end="00:24:58.310" style="s2">think all of that is important and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.840" end="00:25:00.260" style="s2">here&#39;s another word I want to use with</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.310" end="00:25:02.660" style="s2">as much resonance as possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.260" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">important to invoke all of this on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.660" end="00:25:12.890" style="s2">regular and reliable basis rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:18.330" style="s2">simply referring to it hmm yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.890" end="00:25:20.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which so I am let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.330" end="00:25:22.500" style="s2">see if I can use the term theoria here a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.910" end="00:25:25.040" style="s2">little bit in practice so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.500" end="00:25:27.420" style="s2">further get it it&#39;s not every day that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.040" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">conversations are available to use the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.420" end="00:25:47.460" style="s2">word theoria in hair ok so well so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:50.130" style="s2">is a different way in there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.460" end="00:25:54.860" style="s2">a movement towards an erect and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.130" end="00:25:58.530" style="s2">unscripted mode because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.860" end="00:26:01.500" style="s2">necessity I feel the language is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.530" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">appropriate I feel to to presence</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.500" end="00:26:12.690" style="s2">actually gently as we have almost an</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:15.920" style="s2">opponent processing towards it yes we</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.690" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">have an opponent processing towards the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.920" end="00:26:20.910" style="s2">appropriate place of vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:22.440" style="s2">that vulnerability is mourn but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.910" end="00:26:27.330" style="s2">vulnerabilities involved and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.440" end="00:26:31.290" style="s2">vulnerability from me in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.330" end="00:26:33.480" style="s2">especially when we are skimming along</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.290" end="00:26:37.560" style="s2">the surface of what our deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.480" end="00:26:41.070" style="s2">metaphysical cogs and highly direct</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.560" end="00:26:44.520" style="s2">ontology and epistemology is these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.070" end="00:26:46.770" style="s2">the kinds of vulnerabilities that can in</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.520" end="00:26:48.420" style="s2">fact as you speak about so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.770" end="00:26:52.680" style="s2">me in one of your lecture episodes</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.420" end="00:26:54.390" style="s2">invoke a sense of horror if they are yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.680" end="00:26:56.490" style="s2">miss play or if they are dislodged</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.390" end="00:26:59.160" style="s2">without the right bounds of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.490" end="00:27:02.690" style="s2">I&#39;m very attuned to this and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.160" end="00:27:06.030" style="s2">actually have considerable experience in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.690" end="00:27:07.680" style="s2">deep metaphysical unsettling and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.030" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">epistemological and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.680" end="00:27:14.730" style="s2">unsettling over the course of many years</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">and in that sense I feel ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.730" end="00:27:19.560" style="s2">here and do this but there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:23.300" style="s2">which when I&#39;m talking about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.560" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">I I realize how effectively Laden I</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:30.070" style="s2">the affective component that you also</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.410" end="00:27:31.940" style="s2">speak about an awful lot as being a key</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.070" end="00:27:34.030" style="s2">characterization of how we should</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.940" end="00:27:37.070" style="s2">understand relevance realization Oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.030" end="00:27:38.870" style="s2">totally I mean it&#39;s the the coping of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.070" end="00:27:40.760" style="s2">relevance realization is in separately</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.870" end="00:27:43.550" style="s2">bound up with a primordial kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.760" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">caring yes beautiful carrot it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.550" end="00:27:48.820" style="s2">precisely that and for me I was using</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:51.320" style="s2">the language of an affective relation</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.820" end="00:27:53.270" style="s2">before I became so acquainted with your</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.320" end="00:27:55.640" style="s2">work to express to myself that there was</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.270" end="00:27:57.410" style="s2">some important contrast between an</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.640" end="00:27:59.540" style="s2">intellectual way of going at the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.410" end="00:28:02.270" style="s2">and that in some sense our frames were</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.540" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">always and already filtered to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.270" end="00:28:06.410" style="s2">degree by something like and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:08.630" style="s2">was influenced a lot by your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.410" end="00:28:10.220" style="s2">before I came to study you a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.630" end="00:28:11.630" style="s2">I had engaged with it a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.220" end="00:28:15.230" style="s2">the term brother the term relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.630" end="00:28:17.210" style="s2">realization is itself it reveals you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:19.340" style="s2">know the more the more you understand of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.210" end="00:28:21.350" style="s2">it the more you can rock the whole just</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.340" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">through appreciating the terms I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.350" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">it&#39;s very very appropriate it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:30.500" style="s2">very true thing the right terms is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:32.450" style="s2">very important thing to do oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.500" end="00:28:35.570" style="s2">and you know and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.450" end="00:28:37.670" style="s2">actually that I think can be afforded</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.570" end="00:28:39.380" style="s2">like the dialog can help I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.670" end="00:28:41.870" style="s2">spontaneously to generate those terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.380" end="00:28:43.190" style="s2">but it could also be not precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.870" end="00:28:44.510" style="s2">place where you look for them and I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.190" end="00:28:46.340" style="s2">this in my own experience because so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.510" end="00:28:49.310" style="s2">often I&#39;m looking to communicate that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.340" end="00:28:52.490" style="s2">affective component to to enable this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.310" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">sense of shared safety and care so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.490" end="00:28:56.060" style="s2">will go about expressing things in all</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:28:58.040" style="s2">these different ways coming out of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.060" end="00:29:00.140" style="s2">like this like this with these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.040" end="00:29:01.430" style="s2">emotional tones behind it but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.140" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">kind of I would sit down to write</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.430" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">something if I wanted to make something</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:06.860" style="s2">analytically tight in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.930" style="s2">relevance realization has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.860" end="00:29:10.700" style="s2">analytically typed for it to play that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.930" end="00:29:12.650" style="s2">role between the cognitive science on</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.700" end="00:29:19.460" style="s2">the one hand and then also the religio</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.650" end="00:29:21.020" style="s2">right yeah yeah so yeah I I think I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.460" end="00:29:22.490" style="s2">wanted intervene because you made it a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.020" end="00:29:25.490" style="s2">couple of really excellent points I did</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.490" end="00:29:28.790" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want I didn&#39;t want them to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.490" end="00:29:30.620" style="s2">be left one look at the thing you just</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.790" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">said I think there&#39;s yeah I think and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:34.730" style="s2">and there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:35.490" style="s2">theorizing which I think we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.730" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">and there</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.490" end="00:29:39.720" style="s2">where you need those precise terms and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:42.780" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t produce until you&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.720" end="00:29:44.670" style="s2">to precision yes I agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.780" end="00:29:47.640" style="s2">that is the appropriate place to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.670" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">but I think to go back to two points you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.640" end="00:29:52.590" style="s2">made about dia logos and I try to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:55.110" style="s2">the Greek now by way of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:29:57.240" style="s2">because the logos right is much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.110" end="00:29:58.950" style="s2">comprehensive than logic right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.240" end="00:30:01.260" style="s2">the gathering together so that things</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.950" end="00:30:02.790" style="s2">belong together so but India logos</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.260" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">there&#39;s two things you said that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.790" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">very important first we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:08.940" style="s2">ourselves on the edge of we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:11.730" style="s2">yourself into a system that&#39;s dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.940" end="00:30:14.220" style="s2">and and that is going to have emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.730" end="00:30:15.720" style="s2">features the the ongoing emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.220" end="00:30:18.360" style="s2">what we have not pre-planned or</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.720" end="00:30:21.140" style="s2">prepackaged or pre cognized pre thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.360" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">right is is again a vital piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.140" end="00:30:26.070" style="s2">next you mentioned about the effectivity</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">and you mentioned the vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.070" end="00:30:30.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.960" end="00:30:32.490" style="s2">seeing these coming together because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:34.920" style="s2">was really I I really liked what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.490" end="00:30:36.210" style="s2">when you and I were talking about for</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.920" end="00:30:39.540" style="s2">the distinction between ball nabilla and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.210" end="00:30:40.890" style="s2">exposure that had come up guy and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.540" end="00:30:43.350" style="s2">talked a bit about that and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.890" end="00:30:46.890" style="s2">he talked to at length with Jordan about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.350" end="00:30:49.860" style="s2">that because it&#39;s it&#39;s this notion again</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:53.550" style="s2">of sensitization right the difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.860" end="00:30:56.100" style="s2">when you&#39;re exposed right what that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.550" end="00:30:58.940" style="s2">actually what the response is to is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.100" end="00:31:01.080" style="s2">is a hardening right the response is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.940" end="00:31:02.940" style="s2">hardening and because what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.080" end="00:31:04.710" style="s2">to do is defend and protect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.940" end="00:31:07.590" style="s2">from further incursion</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.710" end="00:31:09.240" style="s2">but in vulnerability if we&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.590" end="00:31:10.590" style="s2">as distinct from exposure because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.240" end="00:31:12.929" style="s2">course people use terms in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.590" end="00:31:15.270" style="s2">sloppy ways but if we&#39;re using it in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.929" end="00:31:16.860" style="s2">the distinction vulnerability is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.270" end="00:31:19.890" style="s2">of sensitization you&#39;re allowing</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.860" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">yourself to the things to penetrate into</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.890" end="00:31:24.059" style="s2">you so it comes with that sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.850" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s exactly where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.059" end="00:31:29.190" style="s2">affective component has to be our guide</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.850" end="00:31:33.330" style="s2">because what our effect is often doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.190" end="00:31:36.840" style="s2">is giving us the degree to which our our</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.330" end="00:31:38.730" style="s2">ability to perceive and sense is is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.840" end="00:31:41.520" style="s2">threatening or the degree to which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.730" end="00:31:44.190" style="s2">nourishing our effect is often you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.520" end="00:31:48.030" style="s2">deeply attuned to okay what it what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.190" end="00:31:48.790" style="s2">what is this doing and so I think being</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.030" end="00:31:52.810" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.790" end="00:31:55.510" style="s2">you coordinate you know courage and care</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.810" end="00:31:58.570" style="s2">with vulnerability is what affords it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.510" end="00:32:01.660" style="s2">be actually become that sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.570" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">so a lot of what we are doing is and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.660" end="00:32:05.020" style="s2">again to try and you know really make</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:08.620" style="s2">this word resonate with people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.020" end="00:32:10.210" style="s2">trying to encourage each other and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.620" end="00:32:11.980" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me to coin a new word</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.210" end="00:32:14.830" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to in care each other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.980" end="00:32:17.730" style="s2">trying to create right caring between</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.830" end="00:32:21.700" style="s2">and within each other so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.730" end="00:32:23.890" style="s2">that the vulnerability stays at become</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.700" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">it stays as a sensitivity and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.890" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">harden into a defensive framing of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:36.610" style="s2">I&#39;m overexposed and then that that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">turn you know leads me back to the point</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.610" end="00:32:42.910" style="s2">you made about and this is this is one I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:47.320" style="s2">hope we can spend some time on because</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.910" end="00:32:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of that the the tangled</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.320" end="00:32:54.910" style="s2">but really juicy part if I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.800" end="00:32:56.410" style="s2">that way which is we need we&#39;re not we</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.910" end="00:32:57.640" style="s2">need a place for theorizing let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.410" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">that aside I&#39;ve already acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.640" end="00:33:01.330" style="s2">that and I do that and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:03.130" style="s2">and people know that I care about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.330" end="00:33:05.860" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna take it that that&#39;s a given</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.130" end="00:33:07.450" style="s2">that we need nothing that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.860" end="00:33:09.340" style="s2">here challenges any of that or</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.450" end="00:33:12.930" style="s2">undermines it in any way but when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.340" end="00:33:15.070" style="s2">doing deal logos right we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.930" end="00:33:18.250" style="s2">bring into it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.070" end="00:33:20.680" style="s2">the depths of our ontology you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.250" end="00:33:23.890" style="s2">me we have this is what this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.680" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">see exemplified in Plato right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.890" end="00:33:28.600" style="s2">if you really want to cultivate wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.850" style="s2">and courage and virtue these are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.600" end="00:33:33.880" style="s2">perspectival participatory things and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.850" end="00:33:36.130" style="s2">therefore your deepest patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.880" end="00:33:38.440" style="s2">intelligibility your deepest patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.130" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">coping and sense making are always bound</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.440" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">up with your deepest patterns of caring</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:47.110" style="s2">and concern and identification and so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">mean if we want this to have existential</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.110" end="00:33:54.220" style="s2">depth we have to touch upon the you know</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.220" end="00:33:58.990" style="s2">and so how to do this and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.130" end="00:34:00.970" style="s2">that this is a vital issue in Plato they</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.990" end="00:34:02.200" style="s2">talk about it in the dialogue how to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.970" end="00:34:04.390" style="s2">this you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.200" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">take people even to aporia where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.390" end="00:34:09.370" style="s2">like ah it doesn&#39;t make sense anymore</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:12.790" style="s2">but but not tip them into as you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.370" end="00:34:14.620" style="s2">horror because the point isn&#39;t to the is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.790" end="00:34:16.300" style="s2">is it to immobilize people because</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.620" end="00:34:18.670" style="s2">they&#39;ve now over exposed and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.300" end="00:34:21.940" style="s2">hardened another stock what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.670" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">do is you want to take that and get them</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.940" end="00:34:28.240" style="s2">to commit to it so that that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:31.240" style="s2">Wonder and awe and it draws them forth</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.240" end="00:34:34.450" style="s2">in an aspirational commitment and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.240" end="00:34:36.400" style="s2">that is also part of the finesse of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.450" end="00:34:38.470" style="s2">the deal logos and so I often describe</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.400" end="00:34:40.540" style="s2">this to Gaia&#39;s I want to take circling</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.470" end="00:34:43.180" style="s2">but I want to bring phyleus ophea into</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.540" end="00:34:45.550" style="s2">it I want to bring in right so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.180" end="00:34:47.830" style="s2">doing all the stuff all this really</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.550" end="00:34:51.340" style="s2">valuable and rich and juicy stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.830" end="00:34:52.900" style="s2">circling but we but if we get aware of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.340" end="00:34:55.570" style="s2">all of these dimensions can we then</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.900" end="00:34:57.190" style="s2">bring them in can we then bring in</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.570" end="00:34:59.230" style="s2">finally buy the assaut fiha because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.190" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">deepest and I mean guy is all on board</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.230" end="00:35:03.100" style="s2">about this because this is heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">whole thing right you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.100" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">explore design without exploring being</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">those two are bound together in just</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:13.840" style="s2">inseparable fashion and so III that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:15.550" style="s2">why I wanted to dropped you there was</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.840" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">like four really important things you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.550" end="00:35:19.450" style="s2">had you had you had canvas there and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:21.610" style="s2">thought it was important to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.450" end="00:35:23.830" style="s2">and open them up and unpack them a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.610" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">little bit yes thank you for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.830" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">I thought that was beautiful unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:33.250" style="s2">and I continue to invite you to slow me</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:36.250" style="s2">down and do just that and and in many</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.250" end="00:35:38.380" style="s2">respects the point I was making was one</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.250" end="00:35:41.020" style="s2">that was inviting you to jump in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.380" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">slow it sew it down because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.020" end="00:35:48.310" style="s2">much and it needs to be as there&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:50.020" style="s2">and care to be taken in presencing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.310" end="00:35:52.030" style="s2">and also we&#39;re recording something for</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.020" end="00:35:55.420" style="s2">the benefit of listeners and viewers as</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.030" end="00:35:58.840" style="s2">well so there&#39;s all these pieces and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.420" end="00:36:02.350" style="s2">my sense as well as that so the sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.840" end="00:36:04.120" style="s2">meta reflection which not that theory is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.350" end="00:36:06.070" style="s2">precise I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.120" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">a kind it&#39;s but not so much an</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.070" end="00:36:11.020" style="s2">intellectual and as it is this bearing</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.440" end="00:36:12.600" style="s2">forth of where we are and our being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.020" end="00:36:15.990" style="s2">the moment which can look</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.600" end="00:36:18.590" style="s2">like a type of sort of meta taking once</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.990" end="00:36:30.830" style="s2">out oneself out of the particular frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.590" end="00:36:33.330" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep well</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.830" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">that is that is a process that should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.330" end="00:36:38.760" style="s2">gentle that is that is a process that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">should be gentle and and and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.760" end="00:37:03.090" style="s2">I&#39;d like to continue it so okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">may be interesting to explore is where</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.090" end="00:37:09.450" style="s2">the perhaps where the jump back into</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">theorizing takes place within the space</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.450" end="00:37:15.110" style="s2">of Peoria within the space of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.640" end="00:37:18.660" style="s2">present seeing our beings effectively</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.110" end="00:37:21.510" style="s2">cooperatively realizing a shared space</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.660" end="00:37:24.930" style="s2">of care and vulnerability so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.510" end="00:37:27.060" style="s2">presence truly what we are as much as we</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.330" end="00:37:39.480" style="s2">important it&#39;s like not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.010" end="00:37:41.070" style="s2">doing this thing we&#39;re also building the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.480" end="00:37:42.870" style="s2">table this is often what I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.070" end="00:37:46.080" style="s2">people about it&#39;s like not only not only</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.870" end="00:37:49.140" style="s2">are we present seeing sort of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.080" end="00:37:51.480" style="s2">in this dance at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.140" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">construction of the table at which this</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.480" end="00:37:56.010" style="s2">kind of conversation can take place of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">course your éramos really for so much of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.010" end="00:38:02.280" style="s2">your life but with this with this online</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:04.260" style="s2">element right and with this with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.280" end="00:38:06.870" style="s2">with what seems to me that the genuine</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.260" end="00:38:10.260" style="s2">novelty of this just because of how</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.870" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">actually of how existentially demanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.260" end="00:38:18.330" style="s2">I truly feel it is to to move at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:20.760" style="s2">level right there is you know I come at</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.330" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">this a lot as well from a perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.760" end="00:38:24.590" style="s2">therapy and what education is him you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">can aim you could have</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.590" end="00:38:29.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s press ahead and trust the</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.480" end="00:38:34.820" style="s2">really part and parcel of exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.400" end="00:38:38.860" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about because you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.820" end="00:38:42.020" style="s2">it&#39;s this constant dynamic of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.860" end="00:38:44.420" style="s2">you know of the desire to participate</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.020" end="00:38:46.550" style="s2">and then also accepting precisely where</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.420" end="00:38:48.770" style="s2">you are and not going to further than</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.550" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just breaching the boundary and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.770" end="00:38:54.020" style="s2">this is a big part of my my day to day</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:56.510" style="s2">kind of process but where I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.020" end="00:39:00.650" style="s2">was at just to pick things up for our</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.510" end="00:39:03.560" style="s2">audiences presencing also this</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.650" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">therapeutic aspect and the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.560" end="00:39:11.960" style="s2">which enable in fact trauma to be moved</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:13.880" style="s2">through and positively developed or</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.960" end="00:39:15.710" style="s2">growth to occur from this state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.880" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">a sense in which we want to avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.710" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">which we want to avoid present seeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">that which locks us and freezes us and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:27.350" style="s2">stops us from being able to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:30.080" style="s2">productive relationship with it and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.350" end="00:39:33.560" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a deep importance to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.080" end="00:39:36.700" style="s2">tenderly establishing this domain of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.560" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">shared care and where I was moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.700" end="00:39:42.760" style="s2">potentially in there is where I can pose</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:47.030" style="s2">a question is so we we theory is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.760" end="00:39:49.670" style="s2">aiding us to presence the the being and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.030" end="00:39:51.500" style="s2">the depths of our ontology and creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.670" end="00:39:56.360" style="s2">a landscape of care in which that can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.500" end="00:39:58.580" style="s2">done and then also also now we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.360" end="00:40:00.710" style="s2">consider how we move back into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.580" end="00:40:04.520" style="s2">theory and I wonder how you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.710" end="00:40:07.250" style="s2">characterize that tone so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.520" end="00:40:09.500" style="s2">excellent and and that&#39;s that I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.250" end="00:40:10.670" style="s2">the thing of it is again we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.500" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">German of it because we&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.670" end="00:40:15.710" style="s2">and we keep cycling here and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:18.080" style="s2">a matter of creating something to novo</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.710" end="00:40:20.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of trying to vary through</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.080" end="00:40:24.290" style="s2">participant observation trying to sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.510" end="00:40:26.690" style="s2">of delicately extricate into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.290" end="00:40:28.670" style="s2">stable Theory theoretical terms and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.690" end="00:40:32.860" style="s2">formulation what is it what it what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.670" end="00:40:32.860" style="s2">that&#39;s going on here and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.210" end="00:40:42.590" style="s2">there there seems to be some aspects</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.400" end="00:40:44.630" style="s2">here the turn back to theory is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.590" end="00:40:46.520" style="s2">uh the kind of thing I see going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.630" end="00:40:48.020" style="s2">again and the platonic dialogue in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.520" end="00:40:49.730" style="s2">you are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">there&#39;s never there&#39;s that there&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.730" end="00:40:52.850" style="s2">Manav logic argumentation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:54.320" style="s2">argumentation but it&#39;s always bound up</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.850" end="00:40:56.270" style="s2">with questioning cuz you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.320" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">seeking to involve the other and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.270" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2">as much a again a a receptivity for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:09.290" style="s2">seeking of insight as there is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:15.170" style="s2">attempt to you know come to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.290" end="00:41:17.060" style="s2">argumentative conclusion so well well</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.170" end="00:41:19.570" style="s2">there should be Theory the theory going</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.060" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">on and theorizing I don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.570" end="00:41:24.230" style="s2">III sound like I&#39;m splitting hairs but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:26.270" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to be very very careful here</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.230" end="00:41:27.320" style="s2">well there should be theorizing going on</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.270" end="00:41:30.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there should be Theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.320" end="00:41:32.600" style="s2">building going on which is it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.170" end="00:41:34.520" style="s2">different thing right so one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.600" end="00:41:36.500" style="s2">mean again again I&#39;m asking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.520" end="00:41:38.360" style="s2">everybody&#39;s patience I&#39;m trying to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.500" end="00:41:40.460" style="s2">is very much work in progress but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.360" end="00:41:42.890" style="s2">know what thira it we keep theorizing we</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.460" end="00:41:44.600" style="s2">step back and we do this theory we weary</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.890" end="00:41:46.430" style="s2">presence ourself we restructure the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.600" end="00:41:47.840" style="s2">salience the landscape we reinvestigate</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.430" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">weary sensitize we&#39;re doing all that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.840" end="00:41:52.790" style="s2">stuff right and then but then we also do</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">this we we bring we and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.790" end="00:41:57.890" style="s2">guys invoke invocation of this phrase I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:42:00.740" style="s2">think is so pregnant we come to terms we</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.890" end="00:42:02.420" style="s2">come to terms about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.740" end="00:42:04.790" style="s2">there we we try to it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.420" end="00:42:06.830" style="s2">poesis we try to put it into terms and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.790" end="00:42:08.930" style="s2">then and then and then we and then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.830" end="00:42:11.870" style="s2">question each other we challenge each</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.930" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">other we we link things together but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.870" end="00:42:16.490" style="s2">inference is always open to being</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:19.610" style="s2">impregnated and redirected by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.490" end="00:42:22.730" style="s2">insight and the insight is always open</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.610" end="00:42:25.010" style="s2">to being challenged and right and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.730" end="00:42:26.600" style="s2">structured again by the inference and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:27.890" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get it&#39;s very much like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.600" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">when I were there stuffer I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.890" end="00:42:31.850" style="s2">you know and how in rationality we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.630" end="00:42:34.070" style="s2">trying to balance insight and inference</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.850" end="00:42:36.080" style="s2">and internalization off against each</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.070" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">other that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.080" end="00:42:41.090" style="s2">really come into these practices in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:43.580" style="s2">depth if you are if you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:45.110" style="s2">started down a sappy ntral pathway where</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:46.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some ecologies you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.110" end="00:42:47.569" style="s2">some individual practices for insight</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.850" end="00:42:49.130" style="s2">and inference and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.569" end="00:42:51.559" style="s2">generalization and you&#39;ve got some a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.130" end="00:42:53.479" style="s2">basic ecology for for for networking</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.559" end="00:42:55.339" style="s2">them together because I I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.479" end="00:42:58.009" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do in theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.339" end="00:43:00.109" style="s2">so the izing is yeah yeah I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.009" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">up elements of theory in that there</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.109" end="00:43:04.759" style="s2">there&#39;s inferential moves being made</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:06.650" style="s2">there&#39;s insight and those are talking to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.759" end="00:43:08.809" style="s2">each other but I don&#39;t get it to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.650" end="00:43:10.999" style="s2">monologue right the internalization is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.809" end="00:43:13.130" style="s2">always present you&#39;re always there</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.999" end="00:43:14.299" style="s2">you&#39;re always impregnating and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.130" end="00:43:16.279" style="s2">all these metaphors because those are</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.299" end="00:43:17.809" style="s2">the metaphors Socrates is using right</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.279" end="00:43:19.339" style="s2">and we still think about the how the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.809" end="00:43:23.029" style="s2">word concept originally goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.339" end="00:43:25.729" style="s2">concede right and being the Midwife so</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.029" end="00:43:28.009" style="s2">there&#39;s that but we&#39;re not trying to -</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.729" end="00:43:29.539" style="s2">to - we&#39;re trying to stay with Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.009" end="00:43:31.099" style="s2">not get into Aristotle not because</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.539" end="00:43:33.019" style="s2">Aristotle doesn&#39;t have value but an</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.099" end="00:43:34.729" style="s2">Aristotle I don&#39;t think it&#39;s due to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.019" end="00:43:36.589" style="s2">aerosol I think is due to an accident of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.729" end="00:43:39.019" style="s2">history but an Aristotle all we have is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.589" end="00:43:41.779" style="s2">the monologic treatise and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.019" end="00:43:43.759" style="s2">stay in the Platonic dialogue elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.779" end="00:43:45.349" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing the science then we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.759" end="00:43:47.930" style="s2">the Aristotelian thing then we do the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.349" end="00:43:49.699" style="s2">theory building we should theorize there</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.930" end="00:43:51.289" style="s2">should be inference and insight and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.699" end="00:43:53.180" style="s2">internalization but we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.289" end="00:43:55.400" style="s2">theory building we should generate lots</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.180" end="00:43:58.190" style="s2">of things that we can then look back on</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.400" end="00:44:00.529" style="s2">and say right Oh from from within that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.190" end="00:44:02.299" style="s2">participant observation there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.529" end="00:44:04.190" style="s2">these things I could take them out and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.299" end="00:44:05.930" style="s2">use some theory building or I can bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.190" end="00:44:07.729" style="s2">some theory over here and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.930" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">science to bear on this and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.729" end="00:44:12.549" style="s2">think there&#39;s kind of a meta dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.989" style="s2">between what&#39;s going on in via logos and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.549" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">the scientific study of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.989" end="00:44:18.920" style="s2">cognition and collective intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:20.599" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that&#39;s adequate but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.920" end="00:44:23.989" style="s2">it&#39;s a good beginning you know that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.599" end="00:44:25.609" style="s2">the turn back to theory is is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.989" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s appropriate and fine to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.609" end="00:44:33.170" style="s2">say but keep it distinct from the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:35.329" style="s2">the desire to drop into monologic theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.170" end="00:44:37.579" style="s2">building that that&#39;s one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.329" end="00:44:43.329" style="s2">would recommend yes I hear that I hear</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.579" end="00:44:46.699" style="s2">that ok so here&#39;s something that may</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.329" end="00:44:49.789" style="s2">open this out in an interesting way or</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.699" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">maybe bring it to a more fine point so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.789" end="00:44:58.420" style="s2">something that has been a key interest</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:58.420" style="s2">of mine for some years has been the</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:09.170" style="s2">you know a recurse you know seeking sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.450" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">of a recursive elegance to how I express</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.170" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">modes of orientation in particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:22.020" style="s2">states of consciousness and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:24.330" style="s2">I&#39;m present seeing this is because also</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.020" end="00:45:28.680" style="s2">as well I I believe what I&#39;m looking to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.330" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">do when I&#39;m using some terms to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.680" end="00:45:33.720" style="s2">these modes of orientation in</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:36.390" style="s2">consciousness which may look very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.720" end="00:45:39.480" style="s2">like particular meditative or</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.390" end="00:45:41.190" style="s2">contemplative turns within your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.480" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">experience right</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.190" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">the mindfulness for passenger and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:49.080" style="s2">the contemplation they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:54.020" style="s2">grasping out again of the sort of paying</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.080" end="00:45:58.310" style="s2">attention to something beyond just the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.020" end="00:45:58.310" style="s2">well as like it is like the internal</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.020" end="00:46:06.840" style="s2">quietening the paying attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.960" end="00:46:10.290" style="s2">sort of flowing through and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.840" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">also it&#39;s moving again towards me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.290" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">slightly more on the side of but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:16.590" style="s2">certainly more in touch with the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">in a little way at attempting to feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.590" end="00:46:27.840" style="s2">into a deeper connection with it and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:31.980" style="s2">I&#39;m I mean to speak from a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.840" end="00:46:33.180" style="s2">that&#39;s process philosophical so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.980" end="00:46:35.250" style="s2">looking to stress peak from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.180" end="00:46:39.900" style="s2">perspective where we are sort of</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.900" end="00:46:44.820" style="s2">into each other and certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.330" end="00:46:47.310" style="s2">because ultimately what what I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.820" end="00:46:50.280" style="s2">like to move towards as well as invoking</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.310" end="00:46:52.140" style="s2">a discussion of sacredness and a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.280" end="00:46:54.090" style="s2">in here too because there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.140" end="00:46:56.910" style="s2">which the sacredness as you articulated</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.090" end="00:47:00.090" style="s2">in a series must be seen through a lens</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.910" end="00:47:02.940" style="s2">of well of course it&#39;s forever</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.090" end="00:47:05.790" style="s2">incomplete yet at the same time enabling</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.940" end="00:47:08.250" style="s2">of experiences of deep connection and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.790" end="00:47:09.990" style="s2">unity so it&#39;s the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.250" end="00:47:12.270" style="s2">that never ends its continued</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.990" end="00:47:14.940" style="s2">transformation and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.270" end="00:47:18.230" style="s2">very much accordant with how it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:21.930" style="s2">very well with me it&#39;s in my own</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.230" end="00:47:27.150" style="s2">theorizing it&#39;s a deep constitutive part</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.930" end="00:47:33.230" style="s2">of that yet I also feel I&#39;m I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.150" end="00:47:37.860" style="s2">for and have been looking for some</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.650" end="00:47:47.820" style="s2">which are something like waypoints which</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.820" end="00:47:50.340" style="s2">could be mistaken for a certain kind of</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.600" end="00:47:58.470" style="s2">is and the process is complete when we</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.150" end="00:48:01.320" style="s2">spoke last time we spoke a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.470" end="00:48:03.180" style="s2">about teleology and I realized that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.320" end="00:48:05.820" style="s2">way I was using teleology was in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.180" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">continual self making sense which is not</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.339" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">lot of thoughts I know I&#39;ve jumped a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.780" end="00:49:56.280" style="s2">fair way ahead here but it may be why it</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.150" end="00:49:58.740" style="s2">was wonderful though yeah it was real I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.280" end="00:50:03.720" style="s2">really I found out wonderful yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.740" end="00:50:11.819" style="s2">found out wonderful yet there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.720" end="00:50:14.579" style="s2">there yeah it&#39;s so so yeah the way you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.819" end="00:50:16.170" style="s2">woke that together it&#39;s I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.579" end="00:50:19.500" style="s2">interrupt because it was flowing so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.170" end="00:50:23.700" style="s2">smoothly let me try and see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.500" end="00:50:27.270" style="s2">riff on some of the the points that sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.700" end="00:50:31.260" style="s2">of spring to mind as I review the course</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.270" end="00:50:33.660" style="s2">of that um so this let&#39;s let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.260" end="00:50:36.329" style="s2">with the love and if this brings us back</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.660" end="00:50:38.309" style="s2">to that notion I had and you invoked an</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.329" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">agape as well as a drop leg so I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.309" end="00:50:43.170" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate did this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:46.260" style="s2">mutually reciprocal opening mutually</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.170" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">accelerating disclosure right and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.260" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">idea that you know if I understand</p>

<p begin="00:50:55.470" end="00:50:59.430" style="s2">just in a cognitive insight but in an</p>

<p begin="00:50:59.430" end="00:51:03.960" style="s2">that will adduce right and maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.799" end="00:51:05.819" style="s2">the vulnerability to the world that will</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.960" end="00:51:07.950" style="s2">call forth or reduce from the world it</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.950" end="00:51:13.079" style="s2">disclose itself to me before there was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:15.059" style="s2">way in which I was imposing on the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.079" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">and now and it would kind of will to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.059" end="00:51:21.210" style="s2">power romantic sense and now if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:23.490" style="s2">do that restructuring of my identity</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.210" end="00:51:25.380" style="s2">that that allows the world to disclose</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.490" end="00:51:27.270" style="s2">itself in a way this is Wright&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.380" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">of the sensibility transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.270" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">that that in that we experience this is</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:36.990" style="s2">accelerating disclosure as love that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.400" end="00:51:38.840" style="s2">how you fall in love with somebody or</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.840" end="00:51:43.550" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works because it&#39;s is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.270" end="00:51:45.350" style="s2">deep that that&#39;s the knowing of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.550" end="00:51:48.260" style="s2">and the knowing of whatever it is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.350" end="00:51:51.410" style="s2">right you&#39;re coupled to are so into band</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.260" end="00:51:53.690" style="s2">together that your the the the the</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.690" end="00:51:56.780" style="s2">same thing as selfishness of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.250" end="00:51:59.540" style="s2">realization is bound up with the</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.540" end="00:52:03.140" style="s2">you know directed towards the world I</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.580" end="00:52:06.170" style="s2">think all of that the way you put that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.140" end="00:52:09.980" style="s2">together yes I understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.170" end="00:52:12.410" style="s2">also the thinness of the word interest I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.980" end="00:52:13.910" style="s2">tried to use that word and I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.410" end="00:52:15.230" style="s2">work with John Logan on this trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.910" end="00:52:18.440" style="s2">go back to the original meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.230" end="00:52:20.150" style="s2">word interesa to be within something to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.440" end="00:52:23.480" style="s2">be within something and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.150" end="00:52:24.950" style="s2">revalorisé that like many of our terms</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.480" end="00:52:26.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve trivialized that we&#39;ve thinned it</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.950" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">out dude we just must be a simple</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.750" end="00:52:31.610" style="s2">referential label and not not something</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:33.560" style="s2">that sort of more poetically discloses</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.610" end="00:52:36.560" style="s2">the depths of something but to be within</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.560" end="00:52:38.270" style="s2">interesa that right there yeah like so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.560" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">was I was trying to play on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.270" end="00:52:43.820" style="s2">that relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">constituted by its consists within this</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.820" end="00:52:48.770" style="s2">kind of relationship to itself if it if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.600" style="s2">it if it&#39;s not self monitoring and self</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.770" end="00:52:53.150" style="s2">caring and self coping and self making</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.600" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">and self organizing it&#39;s not profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.150" end="00:52:57.170" style="s2">autopoietic in that way it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:53:00.260" style="s2">to be functioning as relevance</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.170" end="00:53:02.030" style="s2">realization so I understand what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.260" end="00:53:04.340" style="s2">trying to convey with love what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.030" end="00:53:07.190" style="s2">saying is I it was my intent with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.340" end="00:53:10.190" style="s2">word interest sure that etymological</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.190" end="00:53:13.490" style="s2">explorations get back to that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.190" end="00:53:18.290" style="s2">meaning and and therefore give people a</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.490" end="00:53:20.360" style="s2">term so let me be careful here give</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.290" end="00:53:21.980" style="s2">people that term other than love for</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.360" end="00:53:24.560" style="s2">trying to talk about something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.980" end="00:53:26.360" style="s2">grounds what we normally call love but</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.560" end="00:53:28.070" style="s2">now you&#39;ve you&#39;ve taken it in another</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.360" end="00:53:29.630" style="s2">way you&#39;ve said no I want to take the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.070" end="00:53:32.030" style="s2">word love and I want to deepen it down</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.630" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">to reach this transformative death I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.030" end="00:53:34.750" style="s2">think those two things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:38.360" style="s2">converging I think those two points are</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.750" end="00:53:41.810" style="s2">actually deeply convergent and then that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.360" end="00:53:44.360" style="s2">brings me into the other thing that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.810" end="00:53:46.100" style="s2">here&#39;s in theorizing we want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.360" end="00:53:48.350" style="s2">about it we want to do conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.100" end="00:53:50.180" style="s2">analysis on it but in theory oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.350" end="00:53:51.740" style="s2">trying to invoke it whereas you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.180" end="00:53:52.310" style="s2">saying we&#39;re trying to present it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.740" end="00:53:54.500" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.310" end="00:53:57.980" style="s2">trying to give it a like we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.500" end="00:53:59.630" style="s2">give it a functional role right a place</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.980" end="00:54:02.690" style="s2">in a deep sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.630" end="00:54:04.910" style="s2">within the dialog and man as the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.690" end="00:54:06.140" style="s2">ever that well at least sacredness is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.910" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">that ever-present in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.140" end="00:54:10.580" style="s2">dialogues as well it constantly in its</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:13.370" style="s2">invoke like in you know Socrates even</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.580" end="00:54:16.010" style="s2">ends the Phaedrus by with a prayer for</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.370" end="00:54:17.300" style="s2">to the god Pan and and whatever other</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.010" end="00:54:20.420" style="s2">gods were present throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.300" end="00:54:22.010" style="s2">dialogue right so I think talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.420" end="00:54:23.780" style="s2">while trying to also simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.010" end="00:54:25.850" style="s2">invoke and that&#39;s what you always have</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.780" end="00:54:29.030" style="s2">to do and participant observation right</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.850" end="00:54:31.820" style="s2">right about the the sacredness I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.030" end="00:54:35.800" style="s2">is also relevant because once we start</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.820" end="00:54:38.270" style="s2">getting into this this idea of love and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.800" end="00:54:39.980" style="s2">interesa if maybe if I use the Latin</p>

<p begin="00:57:28.190" end="00:57:34.460" style="s2">think that&#39;s a new way of trying to</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">some new language to something that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.520" end="00:57:41.540" style="s2">think nevertheless has an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:42.950" style="s2">heritage and legacy I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.540" end="00:57:45.049" style="s2">mystical traditions and the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.950" end="00:57:47.299" style="s2">traditions speak about sacredness this</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.049" end="00:57:48.859" style="s2">way because it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind as a sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.299" end="00:57:51.410" style="s2">of sacredness that is deeply connected</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.859" end="00:57:53.809" style="s2">to the cultivation of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.410" end="00:57:59.710" style="s2">and wisdom and I offer this as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.809" end="00:58:02.390" style="s2">alternative to another prevalent and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.710" end="00:58:04.339" style="s2">long-standing notion of sacredness as</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.390" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">perfection where perfectionist</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.339" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">understood as coming to rest coming to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.099" style="s2">completion and that was what I always</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:13.309" style="s2">I&#39;ve always objected to the word Telos</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.099" end="00:58:15.500" style="s2">because perfection and completion are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.309" end="00:58:17.880" style="s2">bound well etymologically to the word</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.500" end="00:58:23.250" style="s2">Telos and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.880" end="00:58:25.500" style="s2">sense of a TV ology is it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.250" end="00:58:27.150" style="s2">aspect of that I was resisting and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.500" end="00:58:33.180" style="s2">challenging because I think the notion</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.150" end="00:58:34.950" style="s2">of that what I&#39;m experiencing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.180" end="00:58:38.010" style="s2">standard classical theism there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.950" end="00:58:39.900" style="s2">which I&#39;m criticizing Plato here because</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.010" end="00:58:41.970" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely places where he gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.900" end="00:58:44.490" style="s2">into talking about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.970" end="00:58:48.120" style="s2">perfection and I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.490" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">mistake here it&#39;s unclear what he means</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.120" end="00:58:53.220" style="s2">by that but it&#39;s fair that people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:56.370" style="s2">come away from that and saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.220" end="00:58:58.800" style="s2">sacred is something that is perfect that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.370" end="00:59:00.210" style="s2">generates the experience of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.800" end="00:59:02.550" style="s2">Descartes certainly does this in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.210" end="00:59:04.890" style="s2">meditations right and that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.550" end="00:59:07.560" style="s2">is all about and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.890" end="00:59:11.010" style="s2">just a profound mistake I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.560" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">just a profound mistake so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.010" end="00:59:15.840" style="s2">one of the things that dialogo reveals</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:18.270" style="s2">and here think about the logos now as as</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.840" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">the an agog a as the love and also the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.270" end="00:59:22.320" style="s2">interests say the deepening right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s taking on a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.320" end="00:59:25.410" style="s2">then birthing us and giving us life from</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.900" end="00:59:28.560" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.410" end="00:59:31.380" style="s2">right I think the sacredness in diello</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.560" end="00:59:34.410" style="s2">those needs to be the sacredness not of</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.380" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">perfection but the sacredness of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.410" end="00:59:42.200" style="s2">inexhaustible hmm yeah I hear that John</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:55.050" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful I agree I agree</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.200" end="00:59:57.350" style="s2">you know I so so what is so there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.050" end="01:00:00.060" style="s2">we are not we are not we are not</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.350" end="01:00:03.330" style="s2">perfecting the sacred but we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.060" end="01:00:07.170" style="s2">continually optimizing our capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.330" end="01:00:09.270" style="s2">make sacred yeah yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.170" end="01:00:11.250" style="s2">where the analogy to evolution</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.270" end="01:00:13.770" style="s2">biological evolution is so helpful to me</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.250" end="01:00:15.510" style="s2">if you I mean and people do fall prey to</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.770" end="01:00:18.120" style="s2">the temptation to think that evolution</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.510" end="01:00:19.890" style="s2">is a ladder that there&#39;s a TV ology in</p>

<p begin="01:00:21.180" end="01:00:24.840" style="s2">understand that if that&#39;s different I</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.530" end="01:00:26.250" style="s2">just want to use the standard model of</p>

<p begin="01:00:26.250" end="01:00:31.790" style="s2">analogy right right there isn&#39;t a ladder</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.790" end="01:00:35.240" style="s2">evolution isn&#39;t evolution</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.870" end="01:09:25.640" style="s2">and I&#39;m struck by how there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.280" end="01:09:28.160" style="s2">timeless alluring drawing forth beauty</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.640" end="01:09:29.750" style="s2">in it and a magnificence and and there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.440" end="01:10:04.520" style="s2">here to me is meaningful and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.660" end="01:10:06.650" style="s2">course here that would there was a there</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.520" end="01:10:09.260" style="s2">is a way that was walked which had a</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.650" end="01:10:11.810" style="s2">pattern to it which while itself is not</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.260" end="01:10:13.910" style="s2">in any deep sense the only one it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.810" end="01:10:16.700" style="s2">fixed that&#39;s not what there is there is</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.910" end="01:10:19.550" style="s2">there is there is was a cycle of</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.700" end="01:10:22.070" style="s2">development there you know I loved and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.550" end="01:10:24.740" style="s2">let go a probe really and I open myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.070" end="01:10:27.290" style="s2">again and I faced courageously the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.740" end="01:10:28.790" style="s2">depths of experience and so ok so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.290" end="01:10:30.620" style="s2">final thing to add into this Ike and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.790" end="01:10:33.440" style="s2">then I&#39;m would absolutely love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.620" end="01:10:35.870" style="s2">your responses is this is this you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.440" end="01:10:39.470" style="s2">put the modes of orientation which</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.870" end="01:10:42.140" style="s2">enable that continued pattern making the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.470" end="01:10:44.090" style="s2">humble for the past that you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.140" end="01:10:46.760" style="s2">learning as much as possible and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.090" end="01:10:48.890" style="s2">opening up and creating that future</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.760" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">because we must create our future we</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.890" end="01:10:53.330" style="s2">must create it in an important sense by</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:55.760" style="s2">not making many of the mistakes we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.330" end="01:10:58.040" style="s2">made heretofore I follow the line of</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.760" end="01:10:59.990" style="s2">thinking of a Jordan Hall an awful lot</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.040" end="01:11:02.240" style="s2">with respect to civilization design and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.990" end="01:11:04.220" style="s2">what have you but it&#39;s so ok so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.240" end="01:11:06.170" style="s2">how I stopped there and then there</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.220" end="01:11:09.730" style="s2">there&#39;s another piece they introduced</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.170" end="01:11:12.590" style="s2">but let&#39;s see if how that sort of sits</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.730" end="01:11:14.930" style="s2">ya know so there&#39;s lots of points of</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.590" end="01:11:17.060" style="s2">residence that are coming up for me so</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.930" end="01:11:20.830" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.060" end="01:11:27.980" style="s2">sort of the deep connection between</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.830" end="01:11:30.270" style="s2">temporality and how ontology can put a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.980" end="01:11:32.160" style="s2">call upon us</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.270" end="01:11:33.390" style="s2">so if you see this you see this in</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.160" end="01:11:35.310" style="s2">higher states of consciousness when</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.390" end="01:11:36.780" style="s2">people experience the really real they</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.310" end="01:11:39.630" style="s2">experience what I call on to normativity</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.780" end="01:11:41.219" style="s2">they feel because because meaning is</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.630" end="01:11:43.050" style="s2">about being connected they want to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.219" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">deeply connected so they want an</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.050" end="01:11:46.770" style="s2">increasingly more intimate conformity</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:48.719" style="s2">with this really real and so they will</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.770" end="01:11:51.600" style="s2">transform their lives and their identity</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:53.310" style="s2">so it deeply empowers the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.600" end="01:11:55.890" style="s2">transformation then you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.310" end="01:11:57.300" style="s2">I so and that again I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.890" end="01:11:59.070" style="s2">much a platonic model and then you were</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.300" end="01:12:02.730" style="s2">looking something that of course Plato</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.070" end="01:12:04.320" style="s2">sees is bound up with that well how this</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.730" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">is we are bringing Plato and birdsong</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.320" end="01:12:07.950" style="s2">together that&#39;s the district bees are</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:09.989" style="s2">very interesting and odd thing to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.950" end="01:12:11.930" style="s2">propose them that way but Plato of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.989" end="01:12:17.820" style="s2">course talks a great deal about beauty</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.930" end="01:12:20.190" style="s2">and that it has a capacity to to inspire</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.820" end="01:12:22.260" style="s2">us to aspirations Ascari talks about</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.190" end="01:12:23.610" style="s2">this in her book about how beauty</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.260" end="01:12:25.800" style="s2">prepares us for truth and justice</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.610" end="01:12:27.450" style="s2">because of the way it transforms our</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.800" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">sensibility and transforms our</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.450" end="01:12:31.920" style="s2">motivation so that we become more and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:34.770" style="s2">more capable of seeing the truth we</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.920" end="01:12:36.870" style="s2">become more more capable of acting</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.770" end="01:12:40.620" style="s2">justly and so well there while beauty</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.870" end="01:12:43.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t truth it is a deep affordance of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.620" end="01:12:46.080" style="s2">aspirational path to becoming more</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.500" end="01:12:48.900" style="s2">truthful and to becoming more just and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.080" end="01:12:52.739" style="s2">think all of that I mean and I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.900" end="01:12:55.500" style="s2">Iris Murdoch saw that that was clearly</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.739" end="01:12:57.300" style="s2">what was in the center of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.500" end="01:12:59.460" style="s2">Platonic and the neo platonic tradition</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.300" end="01:13:01.380" style="s2">so I think all of that is very</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.460" end="01:13:05.400" style="s2">interesting it resonates with everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.380" end="01:13:06.840" style="s2">you just said and then let&#39;s bring it</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.400" end="01:13:09.239" style="s2">back to the thing that started it which</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.840" end="01:13:11.130" style="s2">was the the difference experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.239" end="01:13:12.510" style="s2">temporality because what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.130" end="01:13:14.130" style="s2">again about what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.510" end="01:13:16.170" style="s2">this Anna Garden process we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.130" end="01:13:18.210" style="s2">about the process that the way Beauty</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.170" end="01:13:21.570" style="s2">couples me in such a way that my</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.210" end="01:13:23.850" style="s2">identity is restructured my my</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.570" end="01:13:25.230" style="s2">sensibility my salience landscape is</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.850" end="01:13:27.060" style="s2">restructured so the way the world can</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.230" end="01:13:28.920" style="s2">disclose itself because beauty and love</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.060" end="01:13:30.989" style="s2">are bound intricately up together you</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.920" end="01:13:33.630" style="s2">get that usually accelerating disclosure</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.989" end="01:13:37.410" style="s2">and beauty is often a call to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.630" end="01:13:40.550" style="s2">often right if it&#39;s right it has that</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.410" end="01:13:42.920" style="s2">kind of call upon us it draws us forth</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.550" end="01:13:44.600" style="s2">but then there</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.920" end="01:13:46.070" style="s2">there is this and then you know and of</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.600" end="01:13:48.770" style="s2">course this is a high to gary notion too</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.070" end="01:13:51.110" style="s2">i suppose but there&#39;s there&#39;s the sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.770" end="01:13:53.060" style="s2">in which we&#39;re moving and and this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.110" end="01:13:54.800" style="s2">something I&#39;ve talked about with JP JP</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.060" end="01:13:56.120" style="s2">Lamar so I&#39;ve had a bunch of really</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.800" end="01:13:57.650" style="s2">excellent conversations with him I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.120" end="01:14:00.710" style="s2">gonna have one very shortly with him and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.650" end="01:14:03.800" style="s2">with Mary Cohen so I&#39;m looking forward</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.710" end="01:14:09.200" style="s2">to that a lot but there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.800" end="01:14:10.610" style="s2">which I think about white head because</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.200" end="01:14:13.640" style="s2">in white head white weighted of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.610" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">is deeply a platonic he he clearly</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.640" end="01:14:18.050" style="s2">indicates that but he&#39;s also very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:19.970" style="s2">consonant with a lot of Brooks song so</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.050" end="01:14:22.070" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s somebody we could use to to</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.970" end="01:14:26.270" style="s2">talk about this bridge between them but</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.070" end="01:14:30.770" style="s2">what I see what I see in Whitehead as I</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.270" end="01:14:32.900" style="s2">see this bipolar ontology let me try and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.770" end="01:14:34.490" style="s2">articulate this a little you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.900" end="01:14:35.990" style="s2">you know he says that you know there</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.490" end="01:14:37.610" style="s2">many are gathered into the one that</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.990" end="01:14:39.380" style="s2">becomes something new so everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.610" end="01:14:41.060" style="s2">everything is interpenetrating</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.380" end="01:14:43.070" style="s2">everything else and and then it causes</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.910" end="01:15:35.390" style="s2">penetrating with each other this is why</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.860" end="01:15:37.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve been so deeply attracted to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.390" end="01:15:40.550" style="s2">work of John Sakata Sarah Gina from</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.550" end="01:15:43.700" style="s2">within the Christian tradition he&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.550" end="01:15:46.100" style="s2">Titanic figure and it like in from the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.700" end="01:15:49.250" style="s2">ninth century and that he but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.100" end="01:15:50.660" style="s2">regarded as a heretic that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.250" end="01:15:52.660" style="s2">interesting because he&#39;s seen as the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.660" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">great synthesizer of eastern and western</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.660" end="01:15:56.300" style="s2">Christendom Christianity and</p>

<p begin="01:15:56.300" end="01:15:59.989" style="s2">is elevated to very high status in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.610" end="01:16:02.300" style="s2">court and then he was asked to produce</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.989" end="01:16:04.280" style="s2">the dolphin in and he did the para fusee</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.300" end="01:16:06.530" style="s2">on the division of nature and then when</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.280" end="01:16:10.010" style="s2">this came out controversy swirled around</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.530" end="01:16:15.079" style="s2">him because he tried to articulate this</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.010" end="01:16:17.449" style="s2">idea of creation right as something that</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.079" end="01:16:20.690" style="s2">should be understood as being the</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.449" end="01:16:24.020" style="s2">complete interpenetration of e emanation</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.690" end="01:16:26.119" style="s2">from eternity and emergence within time</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.020" end="01:16:27.530" style="s2">and that instead of thinking them as</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.119" end="01:16:29.119" style="s2">opposite we have to think of them</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.530" end="01:16:31.309" style="s2">so here&#39;s metaphysics he doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.119" end="01:16:34.059" style="s2">use a dialectic as he writes there his</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.309" end="01:16:37.219" style="s2">pair for Seon as as a dialogue but</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.059" end="01:16:41.360" style="s2">dialectic is the ontological structure</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.219" end="01:16:43.219" style="s2">he feel he sees like in reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.360" end="01:16:45.710" style="s2">that it&#39;s inherently dialectic precisely</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.219" end="01:16:48.730" style="s2">because of the complete top-to-bottom</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.710" end="01:16:53.389" style="s2">interpenetration of emanation and</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.730" end="01:16:55.790" style="s2">emergence within creation and and so and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.389" end="01:16:57.590" style="s2">then and then - and then to top it all</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.790" end="01:16:59.599" style="s2">off because of the particular notion of</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.590" end="01:17:05.000" style="s2">god which i think is where the heresy</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.599" end="01:17:08.150" style="s2">comes in um he sees all of that as one</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.000" end="01:17:10.280" style="s2">with god&#39;s inherent self creativity that</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.150" end="01:17:12.710" style="s2">when god is creating that that is always</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.280" end="01:17:15.079" style="s2">just an act of self creation so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.710" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">that this dialectic of that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.079" end="01:17:23.869" style="s2">dialectic of creation is is is</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:27.860" style="s2">inseparable from god&#39;s ongoing self</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.869" end="01:17:29.599" style="s2">creativity and so he see again again</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.860" end="01:17:33.110" style="s2">it&#39;s a different notion of the sacred as</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.599" end="01:17:35.449" style="s2">this ongoing inexhaustible production of</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.110" end="01:17:39.889" style="s2">intelligibility as opposed to the at</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.449" end="01:17:42.739" style="s2">rest perfection that&#39;s why i imagine he</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.889" end="01:17:45.170" style="s2">was regarded as heretical he&#39;s now sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.739" end="01:17:46.639" style="s2">of come back around and people are</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.170" end="01:17:48.230" style="s2">starting to consider him much more</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.639" end="01:17:50.750" style="s2">carefully even within theological</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.230" end="01:17:54.099" style="s2">circles precisely because this this</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.750" end="01:18:00.230" style="s2">ontology that he talks about seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.099" end="01:18:02.389" style="s2">so apt for talking about these these two</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.230" end="01:18:04.969" style="s2">things that were trying to bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.389" end="01:18:07.790" style="s2">together within our worldview and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.969" end="01:18:09.770" style="s2">would add apt for providing a deep</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.790" end="01:18:10.570" style="s2">grounding a deep ontological grounding</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.770" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.570" end="01:18:15.980" style="s2">discursive dialectic like what you and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">are doing right here right now hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.980" end="01:18:25.639" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s beautiful okay so</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:28.040" style="s2">two things come to mind both take a long</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.639" end="01:18:30.739" style="s2">time to say let me see if I can reduce</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.040" end="01:18:33.889" style="s2">both quickly so that hopefully we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.739" end="01:18:36.530" style="s2">lose either the first is that I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.889" end="01:18:40.520" style="s2">continue to like to hone in on what I</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.530" end="01:18:44.510" style="s2">mean by modes of orientation yes I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.520" end="01:18:47.870" style="s2">and the second is just how much I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.510" end="01:18:53.960" style="s2">interested in the continued discussion</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.870" end="01:18:57.560" style="s2">and careful experimentation with with</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.960" end="01:19:01.040" style="s2">the embedding and invitation of more</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.560" end="01:19:03.380" style="s2">people to participate in community</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:09.469" style="s2">regarding what we&#39;re speaking about in</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.380" end="01:19:12.770" style="s2">such a fashion that well that that well</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.469" end="01:19:16.730" style="s2">does it justice cares for it but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.770" end="01:19:18.889" style="s2">also interested in the I do feel a sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.730" end="01:19:20.690" style="s2">of urgency and I appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.889" end="01:19:24.260" style="s2">importance of being slow and smooth I</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.690" end="01:19:27.530" style="s2">deeply do and I also feel a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.260" end="01:19:31.429" style="s2">urgency and I and I feel that in our</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.530" end="01:19:34.820" style="s2">culture we are lacking the pillar we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.429" end="01:19:37.010" style="s2">a polis can be together and mutually</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.820" end="01:19:39.710" style="s2">inform each other and disclose</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.010" end="01:19:43.130" style="s2">themselves in this fashion so that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.710" end="01:19:45.380" style="s2">can become more in touch with the state</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.130" end="01:19:47.810" style="s2">of our collective moment and our</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.380" end="01:19:49.880" style="s2">connection to ecology and how we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.810" end="01:19:53.330" style="s2">actually begin to take powerful</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.880" end="01:19:57.110" style="s2">decisions powerful decisions must mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.330" end="01:20:01.850" style="s2">they should be taken from from an</p>

<p begin="01:20:07.190" end="01:20:12.320" style="s2">development of wisdom if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:14.750" style="s2">coming from that then it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.320" end="01:20:15.560" style="s2">deeply it&#39;s is actually horrifying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.750" end="01:20:20.239" style="s2">horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.560" end="01:20:22.580" style="s2">yes and which is why we&#39;re okay so</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.239" end="01:20:23.209" style="s2">that&#39;s that and but it maybe we could go</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.580" end="01:20:25.969" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.209" end="01:20:28.880" style="s2">the modes of orientation route first</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.969" end="01:20:31.090" style="s2">which is easy first of all I like the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:37.459" style="s2">terms I think it&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.090" end="01:20:39.260" style="s2">and I&#39;d like so okay I want to turn back</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.459" end="01:20:42.739" style="s2">things to you very momentarily I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.260" end="01:20:45.019" style="s2">noticed that at crucial points you</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.739" end="01:20:47.719" style="s2">invoked this as something that was</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.019" end="01:20:50.420" style="s2">paying a pivotal meaning the capacity to</p>

<p begin="01:20:59.059" end="01:21:03.229" style="s2">in a high to garyun fashion like I just</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.249" end="01:21:05.059" style="s2">didn&#39;t like you&#39;ve done to step back and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.229" end="01:21:06.709" style="s2">to degree to which you can and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.059" end="01:21:08.389" style="s2">we make mistakes about this and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.709" end="01:21:10.070" style="s2">made some myself but did agree to which</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.389" end="01:21:11.780" style="s2">we can and so more education is needed</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.070" end="01:21:14.780" style="s2">but didn&#39;t read to we can pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.780" end="01:21:17.119" style="s2">to the etymology try to give life back</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.780" end="01:21:20.139" style="s2">to the words so that they can resonate</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.119" end="01:21:23.179" style="s2">in a way that is beyond our normal</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.139" end="01:21:24.979" style="s2">everyday manipulation and control of</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.179" end="01:21:27.019" style="s2">them give them back some of their being</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.979" end="01:21:30.889" style="s2">so they&#39;re not just words that we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.019" end="01:21:32.059" style="s2">so like I said so we&#39;ve got and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.889" end="01:21:34.340" style="s2">trying to do this right now I think with</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.059" end="01:21:36.139" style="s2">modes of orientation and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.340" end="01:21:38.420" style="s2">do when I I was invoking this term</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.139" end="01:21:40.070" style="s2">pivotal that you invoke modes of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.420" end="01:21:42.619" style="s2">orientation because it&#39;s a pivot it</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.070" end="01:21:44.360" style="s2">allows us to move and shift things that</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.619" end="01:21:47.300" style="s2">are otherwise heavy or hard to move</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.360" end="01:21:50.300" style="s2">because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we found a balance</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.300" end="01:21:52.880" style="s2">and a point at which such redirection</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.300" end="01:21:55.489" style="s2">becomes possible for us so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.880" end="01:21:57.349" style="s2">ways in which mode of orientation is</p>

<p begin="01:21:57.349" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">picking up on and what I want to try and</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.820" end="01:22:02.659" style="s2">explore with you I just wanted to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:05.929" style="s2">that note again that the OREA note about</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.659" end="01:22:07.849" style="s2">the value of rien pregnant our words as</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.929" end="01:22:10.340" style="s2">much as possible by paying attention to</p>

<p begin="01:22:10.340" end="01:22:15.019" style="s2">etymology yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.559" end="01:22:17.449" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that you evidence to</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.019" end="01:22:19.039" style="s2">a incredible degree in your lectures and</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.449" end="01:22:21.590" style="s2">I think it&#39;s one of the one of the many</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.039" end="01:22:24.130" style="s2">chief reasons why they afford people to</p>

<p begin="01:22:24.130" end="01:22:34.039" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s great so so okay so modes of</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.239" end="01:22:36.599" style="s2">orientation then fundamentally at all I</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.039" end="01:22:39.429" style="s2">know fundament a key piece in</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.599" end="01:22:41.729" style="s2">the role that these modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.429" end="01:22:45.999" style="s2">are playing is in our relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.729" end="01:22:48.039" style="s2">death and dissolution and broadly</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.999" end="01:22:50.349" style="s2">speaking the chaos that can enter our</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.039" end="01:22:53.889" style="s2">experience the horror as well right</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.349" end="01:22:57.010" style="s2">there dislodging yeah how is it how can</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.889" end="01:22:59.429" style="s2">we find ourselves again how can we find</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.010" end="01:23:02.139" style="s2">connection again from a place of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.429" end="01:23:03.969" style="s2">disconnection in some respects that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.139" end="01:23:07.239" style="s2">one that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.969" end="01:23:10.650" style="s2">and the other is also how we can front</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.239" end="01:23:12.969" style="s2">up to change how we can from a place of</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.650" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">sort of coherence that&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.969" end="01:23:18.579" style="s2">stagnated and stultified decide bravely</p>

<p begin="01:23:18.579" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">confront and attend and it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.159" end="01:23:32.979" style="s2">that the capacity to attend in different</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:35.019" style="s2">modes is is sorts of um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.979" end="01:23:38.670" style="s2">hard for me to imagine the pictures with</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.019" end="01:23:43.469" style="s2">that we&#39;re speaking about without those</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.670" end="01:23:47.050" style="s2">fundamental building blocks of just how</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.469" end="01:23:49.570" style="s2">also poetic processes can be in</p>

<p begin="01:23:52.840" end="01:23:58.929" style="s2">how can we how can we transgress and</p>

<p begin="01:24:05.499" end="01:24:10.989" style="s2">surrender in some sense and also to</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.530" end="01:24:13.749" style="s2">confront the two terms that were pivotal</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.989" end="01:24:15.489" style="s2">for me in making sense of some deep</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.749" end="01:24:17.530" style="s2">psychedelic experience I had were</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.489" end="01:24:19.030" style="s2">confrontation and surrender I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.530" end="01:24:21.550" style="s2">attached to either there is a negative</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.030" end="01:24:23.619" style="s2">and positive mode of each but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.550" end="01:24:25.800" style="s2">just what the terms are maybe I would be</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.619" end="01:24:28.989" style="s2">interested to hear how you would take</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.800" end="01:24:31.420" style="s2">the this kind of discussion and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.989" end="01:24:35.320" style="s2">attached to having to do it through the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.420" end="01:24:38.590" style="s2">lens I&#39;m bringing sure so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.320" end="01:24:40.929" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there I like so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.590" end="01:24:43.139" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s gather together logos gather</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.929" end="01:24:46.090" style="s2">together so the things belong together</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.139" end="01:24:48.909" style="s2">that that you know there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.090" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">this there&#39;s this encouragement and in</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.909" end="01:24:51.670" style="s2">carrying the</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.050" end="01:24:55.119" style="s2">is bound up with the modes of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.670" end="01:24:57.190" style="s2">orientation as you said because what</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.119" end="01:25:00.250" style="s2">we&#39;re facing is we&#39;re facing the real</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.190" end="01:25:02.949" style="s2">possibility of dissolution a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.250" end="01:25:04.929" style="s2">death and so it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.949" end="01:25:06.040" style="s2">term of course in dynamical systems that</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.929" end="01:25:10.510" style="s2">tries to point to this which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.040" end="01:25:13.710" style="s2">criticality our system is critical when</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.510" end="01:25:16.719" style="s2">it is undergoing enough dissolution that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.710" end="01:25:19.480" style="s2">it can restructure and reframe itself</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.719" end="01:25:21.610" style="s2">but if it takes too much then it will</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.480" end="01:25:23.380" style="s2">actually fall into this dissolution so</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.610" end="01:25:25.139" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s called critical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.380" end="01:25:27.989" style="s2">it&#39;s playing on both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.139" end="01:25:32.050" style="s2">critical I think in a very nice fashion</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.989" end="01:25:33.699" style="s2">so I think one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.050" end="01:25:37.389" style="s2">critical one of the things that can get</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.699" end="01:25:40.900" style="s2">us into criticality and that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.389" end="01:25:42.130" style="s2">our culture is not good at and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.900" end="01:25:45.460" style="s2">why I&#39;ve spent some time on I keep</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.130" end="01:25:51.340" style="s2">coming back to it is serious play and</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.460" end="01:25:52.809" style="s2">serious play I think is I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.340" end="01:25:55.659" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that has</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.809" end="01:25:59.639" style="s2">been exacted you see in mammals not just</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.659" end="01:26:03.520" style="s2">in us right serious play is I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.639" end="01:26:04.840" style="s2">indispensable for qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.520" end="01:26:05.889" style="s2">development the kind of development</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.840" end="01:26:07.449" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about here the</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.889" end="01:26:09.460" style="s2">development that the kind there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.449" end="01:26:11.290" style="s2">development that is quantitative where</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.460" end="01:26:12.730" style="s2">you just acquire more and more knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.290" end="01:26:15.639" style="s2">and more information and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.730" end="01:26:18.190" style="s2">qualitative development which I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.639" end="01:26:20.349" style="s2">you can best understand as development</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.190" end="01:26:22.389" style="s2">that must pass through criticality to</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.349" end="01:26:24.159" style="s2">get to the developmental stage you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.389" end="01:26:26.050" style="s2">just keep sort of more of the same and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.159" end="01:26:27.940" style="s2">acquire more you actually have that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.050" end="01:26:29.619" style="s2">need new functionality and so you have</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.940" end="01:26:31.179" style="s2">to put the current functionality at risk</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.619" end="01:26:34.570" style="s2">it has to go into a period of</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.179" end="01:26:36.489" style="s2">criticality and what we see is and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.570" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">know and I think this just is convergent</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.489" end="01:26:40.420" style="s2">with the brilliant work of La Paul and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.320" end="01:26:42.730" style="s2">the brilliant work of Agnes Khaleda but</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.420" end="01:26:44.949" style="s2">we can&#39;t sort of and and and voter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.730" end="01:26:46.690" style="s2">work about you can&#39;t infer a stronger</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.949" end="01:26:48.280" style="s2">logic from a weaker logic you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.690" end="01:26:50.320" style="s2">infer yourself through these</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.280" end="01:26:53.829" style="s2">transformations you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.320" end="01:26:56.860" style="s2">aspire through them and I tried to argue</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.829" end="01:26:59.290" style="s2">that this is that the notion of serious</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.860" end="01:27:01.690" style="s2">play was part of what was at work in in</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.290" end="01:27:04.449" style="s2">nos in the Gnostics or at least that in</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.690" end="01:27:06.130" style="s2">within nauseous because gnosis is again</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.449" end="01:27:10.150" style="s2">the Greek word for that deep kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.130" end="01:27:12.580" style="s2">participatory knowing and and of course</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.150" end="01:27:14.380" style="s2">the Gnostics they sought to place</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.580" end="01:27:16.840" style="s2">themselves into exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.380" end="01:27:18.760" style="s2">existential risk that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.840" end="01:27:23.410" style="s2">about here the conic talks about that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.760" end="01:27:26.080" style="s2">how transgressive of their so the point</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.410" end="01:27:32.290" style="s2">about the the serious play is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.080" end="01:27:36.520" style="s2">how I think human beings it&#39;s it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.290" end="01:27:39.429" style="s2">we put ourselves into a a what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.520" end="01:27:41.820" style="s2">metastability a state of criticality so</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.429" end="01:27:45.010" style="s2">that qualitative development is actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.820" end="01:27:47.170" style="s2">possible for us while also setting up a</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.010" end="01:27:49.920" style="s2">whole bunch of constraints and systems</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.170" end="01:27:54.040" style="s2">so that we can back out or reverse out</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.920" end="01:28:00.940" style="s2">if needed we don&#39;t over and completely</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.040" end="01:28:03.280" style="s2">commit so that like we there we create a</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.940" end="01:28:05.290" style="s2">situation within serious play in which</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.280" end="01:28:08.739" style="s2">we can taste and touch the criticality</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.290" end="01:28:10.750" style="s2">but error is not completely disastrous</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.739" end="01:28:14.050" style="s2">for us there&#39;s there&#39;s more error</p>

<p begin="01:29:20.580" end="01:29:26.640" style="s2">trivialized into fun for us or we think</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.180" end="01:29:29.010" style="s2">if it&#39;s important and serious it must be</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.640" end="01:29:30.900" style="s2">work and then with there&#39;s a step and an</p>

<p begin="01:29:35.970" end="01:29:41.250" style="s2">generally do serious play for adults and</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.540" end="01:29:44.040" style="s2">also perhaps for children but primarily</p>

<p begin="01:29:44.040" end="01:29:49.560" style="s2">is it&#39;s the place where we do serious</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.070" end="01:29:52.830" style="s2">play I mean if you go into church and</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.560" end="01:29:55.230" style="s2">it&#39;s in and you open yourself up mode of</p>

<p begin="01:29:55.230" end="01:29:58.830" style="s2">going on there if that&#39;s viable for you</p>

<p begin="01:30:00.570" end="01:30:04.260" style="s2">viable for you right and you get</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.730" end="01:30:06.000" style="s2">involved with the serious play of the</p>

<p begin="01:30:07.560" end="01:30:11.040" style="s2">resume like whew like you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.690" end="01:30:13.140" style="s2">with your identity and you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.040" end="01:30:14.940" style="s2">with some of your deepest effective</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.140" end="01:30:18.540" style="s2">machinery and you&#39;re really allowing you</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.940" end="01:30:20.580" style="s2">but you&#39;re you&#39;re involved with a kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.540" end="01:30:22.530" style="s2">of profound serious play that</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.580" end="01:30:24.150" style="s2">nevertheless there&#39;s a community around</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.530" end="01:30:26.130" style="s2">you there&#39;s a tradition around you</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.150" end="01:30:29.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve been taken into a space outside</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.130" end="01:30:31.170" style="s2">of the ongoing profane space of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.400" end="01:30:33.480" style="s2">world so you you&#39;re safe from the world</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.170" end="01:30:35.940" style="s2">for a while so there&#39;s a lot more error</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.480" end="01:30:37.860" style="s2">tolerance there&#39;s a lot more support and</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.940" end="01:30:39.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a ritual that other people have</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.860" end="01:30:42.050" style="s2">tried so you&#39;re not just starting it in</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.810" end="01:30:46.440" style="s2">an other didactic fashion from scratch</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.050" end="01:30:50.070" style="s2">and so I think there are there are deep</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.440" end="01:30:52.860" style="s2">connections between the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.070" end="01:30:54.270" style="s2">and our inability to take up the</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.860" end="01:30:56.010" style="s2">appropriate modes of modes of</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.270" end="01:30:59.550" style="s2">orientation precisely because our</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.010" end="01:31:02.960" style="s2">culture is really really poor dealing</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.550" end="01:31:05.580" style="s2">with serious play like and notice how</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.960" end="01:31:09.300" style="s2">how poorly and I mean that even</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.580" end="01:31:11.700" style="s2">economically we reward people who who</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.300" end="01:31:15.210" style="s2">live lives in which serious play like</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.700" end="01:31:18.030" style="s2">musicians and artists and other people</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.210" end="01:31:20.700" style="s2">who have decided that serious play is</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.030" end="01:31:22.710" style="s2">something that needs to be exemplified</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.700" end="01:31:25.230" style="s2">and enacted we tend to say but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.710" end="01:31:27.120" style="s2">not as important as work you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.230" end="01:31:29.820" style="s2">there&#39;s Protestant work at work we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.120" end="01:31:31.740" style="s2">card maker you know all that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.820" end="01:31:35.310" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t work I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.740" end="01:31:36.540" style="s2">uh but we I mean again another symptom</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.310" end="01:31:39.120" style="s2">of the meeting crisis and this has</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.540" end="01:31:41.400" style="s2">become a pervasive we have a culture and</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.120" end="01:31:43.110" style="s2">work workaholism right we&#39;re call ism</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.400" end="01:31:46.740" style="s2">what is it workaholism is i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.110" end="01:31:49.590" style="s2">all accepted workaholics yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.740" end="01:31:54.300" style="s2">basically people people do not know how</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.590" end="01:31:56.880" style="s2">to be other than work so they do not</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.300" end="01:31:59.910" style="s2">know how to become really because they</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.880" end="01:32:01.710" style="s2">can&#39;t engage in serious play and han</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.910" end="01:32:05.570" style="s2">talks about this in the agony of ecstasy</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.710" end="01:32:07.980" style="s2">they get into a you know a mode of self</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.570" end="01:32:11.040" style="s2">exploitation where they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.980" end="01:32:13.020" style="s2">driven to achieve to achieve to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.040" end="01:32:14.670" style="s2">and they can&#39;t engage in actual</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.020" end="01:32:16.380" style="s2">development in serious play so when</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.670" end="01:32:19.350" style="s2">they&#39;re not working all they can do is</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.380" end="01:32:23.340" style="s2">to drop into a kind of super almost a</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.350" end="01:32:28.650" style="s2">lethargy of luxury they like so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.340" end="01:32:30.980" style="s2">that that something really important</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.650" end="01:32:34.680" style="s2">goes on all you&#39;re doing is basically</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.980" end="01:32:37.370" style="s2">recovering so that you can go back to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.680" end="01:32:42.420" style="s2">work and so i think that&#39;s also a very</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.370" end="01:32:44.910" style="s2">important social problem that is feeding</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.420" end="01:32:48.930" style="s2">back into the meeting crisis because of</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.910" end="01:32:50.760" style="s2">the way it is foreclosing for us access</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.930" end="01:32:52.680" style="s2">to the modes of orientation that are</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.760" end="01:32:54.270" style="s2">most appropriate for deep development</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.680" end="01:32:56.850" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.270" end="01:32:59.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s remarkable to me because you</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.850" end="01:33:02.670" style="s2">tied the link there between modes of</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.610" end="01:33:05.490" style="s2">orientation and the development of a</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.670" end="01:33:09.570" style="s2">space within culture where people can</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.490" end="01:33:11.490" style="s2">precisely come together and seriously</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.570" end="01:33:13.680" style="s2">play in the fashion the way to describe</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.490" end="01:33:16.950" style="s2">doing it we&#39;re doing it right now and</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.680" end="01:33:21.660" style="s2">this is what I mean about and and this</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.950" end="01:33:24.030" style="s2">is why I often so I vertically don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.660" end="01:33:25.110" style="s2">respond to comments in the videos</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.030" end="01:33:27.180" style="s2">because first of all there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.110" end="01:33:29.190" style="s2">and I couldn&#39;t I can&#39;t and secondly</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.180" end="01:33:31.050" style="s2">people are people are often just exempt</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.190" end="01:33:33.240" style="s2">Irenaeus you know expressing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.050" end="01:33:34.530" style="s2">fine I don&#39;t that&#39;s fine do that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.240" end="01:33:35.910" style="s2">they often they want to talk to other</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.530" end="01:33:38.040" style="s2">people all of that and there&#39;s all those</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.910" end="01:33:41.310" style="s2">reasons sometimes if somebody catches me</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.040" end="01:33:43.350" style="s2">on a factual error then I&#39;ll admit it on</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.310" end="01:33:45.060" style="s2">that way or if there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.350" end="01:33:45.450" style="s2">somebody else that I&#39;m like you if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.060" end="01:33:47.250" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.450" end="01:33:48.870" style="s2">did I respond because we have an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.250" end="01:33:50.940" style="s2">dialogue and I know that I have access</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.870" end="01:33:52.980" style="s2">to you in a deep dialogue not the</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.940" end="01:33:54.000" style="s2">superficial format of commenting on</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.980" end="01:33:57.300" style="s2">YouTube which I think could be very</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.000" end="01:34:01.170" style="s2">irresponsible in in so many ways so but</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.300" end="01:34:02.670" style="s2">right I&#39;ve replied a couple times when</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.170" end="01:34:04.560" style="s2">people have commented in my dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.670" end="01:34:06.540" style="s2">with Jordan Hall and they say like this</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.560" end="01:34:09.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t going anywhere and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.540" end="01:34:14.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like no no stop thinking of this as</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.420" end="01:34:18.060" style="s2">work right what Jordan is doing is he is</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.660" end="01:34:20.790" style="s2">exemplifying a very profound kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.060" end="01:34:23.820" style="s2">serious play he&#39;s showing us how to</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.790" end="01:34:26.520" style="s2">participatory knowing what serious what</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.820" end="01:34:30.060" style="s2">serious play in dialogue is like because</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.520" end="01:34:31.440" style="s2">he is trying to afford development much</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.060" end="01:34:34.380" style="s2">more than he&#39;s trying to come to a</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.440" end="01:34:36.030" style="s2">conclusive proposition and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.380" end="01:34:40.940" style="s2">needs to be paid very careful attention</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.030" end="01:34:44.640" style="s2">to yeah beautiful I absolutely agree and</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.940" end="01:34:46.650" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly a deep reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.640" end="01:34:50.490" style="s2">respect Jordan so much for he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.650" end="01:34:53.340" style="s2">and I feel that I feel a deep resonance</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.490" end="01:34:56.430" style="s2">actually on that point you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.340" end="01:35:00.540" style="s2">generally speaking moving around in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.430" end="01:35:02.820" style="s2">world I&#39;m engaging with people much the</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.540" end="01:35:04.320" style="s2">same as this I think usually with more</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.820" end="01:35:05.970" style="s2">with a bit more lightness not that I</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.320" end="01:35:08.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t felt light in this but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.970" end="01:35:10.560" style="s2">also the sense in which that this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.280" end="01:35:12.390" style="s2">recorded and I&#39;m sort of sitting still I</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.560" end="01:35:17.670" style="s2">actually like to move around quite a lot</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.390" end="01:35:21.630" style="s2">you know I&#39;m yeah yeah and but but but</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.670" end="01:35:24.270" style="s2">fundamentally the way in to meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.630" end="01:35:26.310" style="s2">relationships with people is almost</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.270" end="01:35:28.470" style="s2">always and maybe it is always I just</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.310" end="01:35:30.960" style="s2">want to have a bit of humility and</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.470" end="01:35:34.710" style="s2">speaking extemporaneously like this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.960" end="01:35:38.310" style="s2">to meet someone precisely where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.710" end="01:35:41.160" style="s2">at with present seeing the part of</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.310" end="01:35:45.920" style="s2">themselves in relationship to you that</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.160" end="01:35:48.540" style="s2">is ready and able and willing to</p>

<p begin="01:36:50.630" end="01:36:56.300" style="s2">that gap that we encountered so that you</p>

<p begin="01:36:56.300" end="01:37:03.860" style="s2">say about another sort of 25 minutes I</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.770" end="01:37:06.079" style="s2">was okay beautiful okay excellent okay</p>

<p begin="01:37:10.760" end="01:37:15.050" style="s2">opportunity and I have worked fairly</p>

<p begin="01:37:15.050" end="01:37:19.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s a thing in dialog that I</p>

<p begin="01:37:22.790" end="01:37:26.420" style="s2">beautiful areas of dialogue and places</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.040" end="01:37:27.980" style="s2">we could go but it almost feels like</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.420" end="01:37:30.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a special power right now</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.980" end="01:37:33.170" style="s2">because I can drop in I can drop into</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.650" end="01:37:35.000" style="s2">myself and drop a question and I can</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.170" end="01:37:39.469" style="s2">throw it over to you and you&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.000" end="01:37:41.300" style="s2">agree so it&#39;s hilarious it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.469" end="01:37:44.170" style="s2">world can open up to me just from doing</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.300" end="01:37:47.510" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite remarkable so</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.170" end="01:37:50.239" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to if you don&#39;t mind take</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.510" end="01:37:53.599" style="s2">that opportunity to do just that and see</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.239" end="01:37:55.719" style="s2">in what way we can we can unleash what</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.599" end="01:37:58.719" style="s2">you can have to offer</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.719" end="01:37:58.719" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.260" end="01:38:15.260" style="s2">hmm oh this is it so hmm okay so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.840" end="01:38:18.020" style="s2">a few areas of inquiry that have come to</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.260" end="01:38:20.890" style="s2">mind first of all I was really motivated</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.020" end="01:38:26.240" style="s2">by this notion of joy and in what sense</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.890" end="01:38:32.120" style="s2">in what sense we you can create for us</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.240" end="01:38:34.670" style="s2">here or speak to how of how of how or</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.120" end="01:38:38.960" style="s2">where may be ripe you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.670" end="01:38:42.320" style="s2">creation of a an element or space within</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.960" end="01:38:45.020" style="s2">culture that can afford a sort of joyful</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.320" end="01:38:47.180" style="s2">opening of people&#39;s expression and then</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.020" end="01:38:49.940" style="s2">you know what came to me John I felt</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.180" end="01:38:51.230" style="s2">that maybe they are you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.940" end="01:38:54.350" style="s2">metaphorically they&#39;re the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.230" end="01:39:00.170" style="s2">opponent processing of that and I felt I</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.350" end="01:39:04.700" style="s2">felt into a a difficulty and a certain</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.170" end="01:39:06.980" style="s2">trauma of our time and and that is going</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.700" end="01:39:10.450" style="s2">to be a bit of a lateral jump but it may</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.980" end="01:39:13.760" style="s2">be somewhat resonant and that for me is</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.450" end="01:39:16.640" style="s2">one experienced I think by both men and</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.760" end="01:39:19.820" style="s2">women by both but in a both masculine</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.640" end="01:39:25.460" style="s2">sense and a feminine sense but there is</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.820" end="01:39:27.320" style="s2">a the the whole world of me too and just</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.460" end="01:39:29.500" style="s2">not what me too is specifically but what</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.320" end="01:39:32.200" style="s2">it&#39;s tapping into in sort of a certain</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.500" end="01:39:34.580" style="s2">disconnection and in some sense and</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.200" end="01:39:36.440" style="s2">inappropriate kind of relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.580" end="01:39:38.540" style="s2">an environment fundamentally of not</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.440" end="01:39:41.600" style="s2">caring there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep sense in</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.540" end="01:39:45.860" style="s2">which an interlocking sense of care has</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.600" end="01:39:49.270" style="s2">not been managed for whatever reason for</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.860" end="01:39:51.890" style="s2">the psyches of people involved in this</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.270" end="01:39:55.820" style="s2">millio that we find ourselves in and</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.890" end="01:39:59.990" style="s2">something I&#39;ve experienced is that there</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.820" end="01:40:01.280" style="s2">is a there&#39;s a particular I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.990" end="01:40:05.450" style="s2">and what maybe not a particular but</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.280" end="01:40:07.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep sense of a a woundedness</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.450" end="01:40:08.570" style="s2">for both masculine and feminine but</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.070" end="01:40:10.460" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe you&#39;ve concentrated on the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.570" end="01:40:12.670" style="s2">feminine perhaps they have to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.460" end="01:40:14.140" style="s2">together that&#39;s crucially important</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.670" end="01:40:16.120" style="s2">I think people don&#39;t do that enough</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.140" end="01:40:18.840" style="s2">really speak to both masculinity and</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.120" end="01:40:23.050" style="s2">femininity together but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.840" end="01:40:25.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a block there&#39;s somehow an</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.050" end="01:40:27.790" style="s2">environment of safety that must be</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.060" end="01:40:29.679" style="s2">cultivated so presence a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.790" end="01:40:33.210" style="s2">I would like to say and it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.679" end="01:40:36.429" style="s2">metaphorical is a distinctly feminine</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.210" end="01:40:38.980" style="s2">kind of energy a feminine kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.429" end="01:40:42.130" style="s2">vulnerability in certain spaces for that</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.980" end="01:40:44.260" style="s2">to be presence but not in not to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.130" end="01:40:47.020" style="s2">looked for that not to be an exposure</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.260" end="01:40:48.850" style="s2">for that presence seeing not to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.020" end="01:40:52.239" style="s2">then as prey you know what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.850" end="01:40:54.370" style="s2">like it&#39;s there has and it&#39;s enabling of</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.239" end="01:40:56.800" style="s2">that vulnerability because without that</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.370" end="01:40:59.410" style="s2">and the appropriate relationship there</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.800" end="01:41:02.940" style="s2">in men and women seriously playing</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.410" end="01:41:07.239" style="s2">together you know joy is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.940" end="01:41:08.830" style="s2">hampered joy is going to be concerned</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.239" end="01:41:11.920" style="s2">with whether or not it&#39;s vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.830" end="01:41:14.199" style="s2">expression is in some senses unsafe so</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.920" end="01:41:16.870" style="s2">what are your thoughts on that mode of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.199" end="01:41:20.920" style="s2">inquiry oh that&#39;s that&#39;s very that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.870" end="01:41:23.980" style="s2">very very important one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.920" end="01:41:25.570" style="s2">try to do is in order to discharge some</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.980" end="01:41:29.130" style="s2">of the reactivity around the words I</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.570" end="01:41:32.140" style="s2">often shift to yin and yang rather than</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.130" end="01:41:33.690" style="s2">feminine and masculine because that</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.140" end="01:41:36.880" style="s2">those tend to have a more ontological</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.690" end="01:41:39.480" style="s2">Association as opposed to they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.880" end="01:41:42.460" style="s2">highly politicized understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.480" end="01:41:44.080" style="s2">masculine and feminine not that there</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.460" end="01:41:46.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t important political issues there</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.080" end="01:41:47.620" style="s2">are not I&#39;m not denying the history of</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.000" end="01:41:50.080" style="s2">feminism or its value I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.620" end="01:41:51.610" style="s2">that sometimes it&#39;s hard to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.080" end="01:41:55.090" style="s2">the things you want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.610" end="01:42:01.090" style="s2">notice how there&#39;s trepidation yeah how</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.090" end="01:42:06.820" style="s2">you&#39;re moving around these words so the</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.090" end="01:42:10.140" style="s2">yin and yang aspects to me call me in so</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.820" end="01:42:12.190" style="s2">wonderfully when I move from adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.140" end="01:42:14.980" style="s2">Procera framing to an opponent</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.190" end="01:42:18.850" style="s2">processing and then I see this very much</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.980" end="01:42:24.219" style="s2">at work in circling in which I men and</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.850" end="01:42:26.289" style="s2">women in in the circling right and and</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.219" end="01:42:27.460" style="s2">you know the</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.289" end="01:42:29.679" style="s2">there is all kinds of overly simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.460" end="01:42:30.519" style="s2">things Oh everybody&#39;s the same that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.679" end="01:42:32.230" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.519" end="01:42:34.090" style="s2">being a man being a woman that makes a</p>

<p begin="01:42:34.090" end="01:42:41.590" style="s2">pretense ah but also to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.710" end="01:42:44.079" style="s2">simple you know categorizations of what</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.590" end="01:42:45.369" style="s2">that means is also that&#39;s why again I</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.079" end="01:42:46.869" style="s2">try to use this you know yang because</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.369" end="01:42:49.719" style="s2">these these are much more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.869" end="01:42:52.719" style="s2">and deep and you know multi vocal terms</p>

<p begin="01:43:18.909" end="01:43:23.559" style="s2">person like when when guy is doing his</p>

<p begin="01:43:37.590" end="01:43:42.880" style="s2">variety the the attempt to project of</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.690" end="01:43:45.159" style="s2">the yang the attempt to sensitize at the</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.880" end="01:43:47.739" style="s2">end and that and if they&#39;re there if</p>

<p begin="01:43:56.320" end="01:44:00.519" style="s2">themselves as representing one of this</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.630" end="01:44:02.170" style="s2">constraints rather what they want to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.519" end="01:44:05.050" style="s2">is they want to participate as fully as</p>

<p begin="01:44:15.699" end="01:44:21.369" style="s2">of the polls and put them into some kind</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.610" end="01:44:25.440" style="s2">of competition with each other now I</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.369" end="01:44:28.150" style="s2">think all of that is very very important</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.440" end="01:44:31.659" style="s2">now we have to take great care because</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.150" end="01:44:33.909" style="s2">that that that is a very real</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.659" end="01:44:35.710" style="s2">possibility and it is a possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.909" end="01:44:39.340" style="s2">both the men and the women I think in</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.710" end="01:44:40.210" style="s2">the circling deeply value I that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.340" end="01:44:42.160" style="s2">is my I</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.210" end="01:44:44.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve come I have a strong conviction</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.160" end="01:44:45.700" style="s2">that that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing in the</p>

<p begin="01:44:45.700" end="01:44:51.280" style="s2">so are you still there Tim yes I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.480" end="01:44:53.650" style="s2">I think they&#39;re first yes yeah you fro</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.280" end="01:44:55.060" style="s2">yeah okay did you hear everything I said</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.650" end="01:44:56.170" style="s2">about both yes both the men and women</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.060" end="01:45:00.969" style="s2">are deeply value okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.170" end="01:45:02.410" style="s2">and so I I want to acknowledge all of</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.969" end="01:45:04.330" style="s2">that and I want to acknowledge it</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.410" end="01:45:05.620" style="s2">reverentially and I want to recommend it</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.330" end="01:45:07.870" style="s2">as something you should be paying more</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.620" end="01:45:11.440" style="s2">attention to that instead of positioning</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.870" end="01:45:12.940" style="s2">and adversarial we can we can hold the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.440" end="01:45:15.370" style="s2">opponent processing and move to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.940" end="01:45:17.560" style="s2">space given by the constraints right I</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.370" end="01:45:20.770" style="s2">want to acknowledge that reverentially</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.560" end="01:45:23.530" style="s2">while also acknowledging that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.770" end="01:45:25.719" style="s2">address all the traumatic damage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.530" end="01:45:28.980" style="s2">been done by the kind of disconnect</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.719" end="01:45:31.810" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.980" end="01:45:34.750" style="s2">for all kinds of cultural historical and</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.810" end="01:45:38.080" style="s2">psychopathological regions have hurt</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.750" end="01:45:39.790" style="s2">each other around you know issues of</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.080" end="01:45:47.650" style="s2">gender and the masculine and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.790" end="01:45:50.230" style="s2">feminine III I think I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.650" end="01:45:52.239" style="s2">what I want to say there is my one</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.230" end="01:45:54.010" style="s2">criticism about how many people talk</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.239" end="01:45:55.630" style="s2">about for lack of a better adjective and</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.010" end="01:45:56.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite the right adjective but</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.630" end="01:45:58.450" style="s2">it&#39;s the one that I&#39;m gonna use right</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.860" end="01:46:00.489" style="s2">now how people talk about the political</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.450" end="01:46:04.050" style="s2">aspect if that&#39;s the one criticism I</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.489" end="01:46:07.330" style="s2">have is it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.050" end="01:46:13.300" style="s2">expression of anger and resentment on</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.330" end="01:46:16.570" style="s2">both sides or multiple sites I guess is</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.300" end="01:46:18.660" style="s2">being prioritized over trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.570" end="01:46:23.500" style="s2">a shared goal of bringing about healing</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.660" end="01:46:25.780" style="s2">from the trauma and here&#39;s how the two</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.500" end="01:46:30.520" style="s2">points connect together I think if we</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.780" end="01:46:33.190" style="s2">recover the in yang dynamism that can</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.520" end="01:46:36.310" style="s2">tell us that it that healing is really</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.190" end="01:46:40.390" style="s2">possible and that therefore we should be</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.310" end="01:46:43.120" style="s2">balancing the needed criticism with the</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.390" end="01:46:46.840" style="s2">ultimate prioritizing of the goal of</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.120" end="01:46:49.030" style="s2">healing and that is not to trivialize or</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.840" end="01:46:51.219" style="s2">equate everybody&#39;s suffering or to do</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.030" end="01:46:53.800" style="s2">anything simplistic like that all right</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.219" end="01:46:58.110" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m I hope I&#39;m not being stupid</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.800" end="01:47:01.599" style="s2">here in that fashion but I do think that</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.110" end="01:47:05.500" style="s2">you&#39;re running out of time and we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.599" end="01:47:08.020" style="s2">to figure out how to more deeply live</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.500" end="01:47:10.780" style="s2">together and love together and work and</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.020" end="01:47:14.020" style="s2">play together and develop together if</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.780" end="01:47:16.780" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna save things and so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.020" end="01:47:20.920" style="s2">to give more priority to the healing we</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.780" end="01:47:24.750" style="s2">just have to do I mean I don&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.920" end="01:47:24.750" style="s2">real alternative for all of us together</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.260" end="01:47:44.650" style="s2">yes yes yes and the movement we not us</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.010" end="01:47:48.099" style="s2">in terms of us and them this how come we</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.650" end="01:47:50.619" style="s2">are part of this yeah this opponent</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.099" end="01:47:53.320" style="s2">processing is like a the rhythm I I love</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.619" end="01:47:56.860" style="s2">the metaphors I speak so much most</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.320" end="01:47:59.489" style="s2">mostly to open up to people about where</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.860" end="01:48:02.860" style="s2">I&#39;m where I&#39;m thinking and feeling and</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.489" end="01:48:05.590" style="s2">how I&#39;m being in the world is through</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.860" end="01:48:08.770" style="s2">the metaphor of rhythm and music what</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.590" end="01:48:12.130" style="s2">I&#39;m finding most powerful is this notion</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.770" end="01:48:15.880" style="s2">of the deep drums stuff tap in and feel</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.130" end="01:48:20.380" style="s2">into the deep drums that are present you</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.880" end="01:48:25.530" style="s2">know all the noise all the noise it is a</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.380" end="01:48:25.530" style="s2">it&#39;s an innate capacity of all of us -</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.219" end="01:48:33.429" style="s2">yeah and I like the shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.969" end="01:48:34.929" style="s2">associations that it&#39;s calling forth I</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.429" end="01:48:36.219" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.929" end="01:48:38.440" style="s2">wonderful that&#39;s wonderful thank you</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.219" end="01:48:41.770" style="s2">that&#39;s very I like that metaphor a lot</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.440" end="01:48:50.290" style="s2">too deep drums yeah so I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.770" end="01:48:51.969" style="s2">you know I it worries me because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.290" end="01:48:58.210" style="s2">you know the adversarial processing is</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.969" end="01:49:01.480" style="s2">becoming so so prominent and such it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.210" end="01:49:03.010" style="s2">being sort of indicated as so mesh with</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.480" end="01:49:06.429" style="s2">the only way to have power and influence</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.010" end="01:49:08.490" style="s2">I do worry about our ability to get back</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.429" end="01:49:12.970" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.490" end="01:49:15.280" style="s2">the sense of opponent processing see the</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.970" end="01:49:17.500" style="s2">to me one of the one of the crucial</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.280" end="01:49:18.550" style="s2">differences is an opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.500" end="01:49:21.400" style="s2">and this is again the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.550" end="01:49:23.200" style="s2">dialogue and monologue it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.400" end="01:49:23.710" style="s2">difference between fie Lia Sophia and</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.200" end="01:49:26.320" style="s2">fie Lea</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.710" end="01:49:29.950" style="s2">nykeya the love of wisdom versus the</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.320" end="01:49:35.020" style="s2">love of victory right is that we what we</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.950" end="01:49:38.770" style="s2">should share about both of us always is</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.020" end="01:49:41.100" style="s2">a commitment to the process as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.770" end="01:49:44.260" style="s2">to the victory of whatever position</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.100" end="01:49:46.180" style="s2">we&#39;re advocating and see democracies</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.260" end="01:49:48.340" style="s2">were supposed to and they did for a long</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.180" end="01:49:51.070" style="s2">time work and people being committed to</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.340" end="01:49:54.670" style="s2">the process and the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.070" end="01:49:57.250" style="s2">conflict within right between the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.670" end="01:49:59.740" style="s2">parties was ultimately the best way to</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.250" end="01:50:03.310" style="s2">embody self correction that what we were</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.740" end="01:50:05.560" style="s2">actually invested in was because I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.310" end="01:50:08.110" style="s2">the ultimate value of democracy is its</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.560" end="01:50:10.840" style="s2">capacity for self correction that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.110" end="01:50:12.310" style="s2">sets it above the other systems and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.840" end="01:50:13.690" style="s2">think once it loses self correction it</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.310" end="01:50:15.400" style="s2">becomes what Winston Churchill I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.690" end="01:50:16.570" style="s2">it&#39;s the worst - next in which the</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.400" end="01:50:17.830" style="s2">Churchill said it&#39;s the worst system</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.570" end="01:50:20.260" style="s2">next to all the rest but I think if you</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.830" end="01:50:21.580" style="s2">remove that the commitment is self</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.260" end="01:50:25.180" style="s2">correction then it just simply becomes</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.580" end="01:50:28.120" style="s2">the worst system right and and so I</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.180" end="01:50:33.210" style="s2">think that you have to have a commitment</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.120" end="01:50:35.320" style="s2">to the process because of an unwavering</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.210" end="01:50:38.590" style="s2">understanding and appreciation and</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.320" end="01:50:41.020" style="s2">reverence for how much self correction</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.590" end="01:50:43.510" style="s2">is continually needed by all and</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.020" end="01:50:46.840" style="s2">therefore why the opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.510" end="01:50:49.300" style="s2">must be respected above and beyond your</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.840" end="01:50:52.000" style="s2">own particular party and position at all</p>
