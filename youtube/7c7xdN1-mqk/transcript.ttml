<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">and then at some point i imagine uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a pivot to some collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">questioning so that being said i will</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">allow every uh everyone to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">but everyone keep themselves on mute</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">except we need to and rhea at this point</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">so i&#39;ll take you in now nida</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">okay um um so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">we had a little brief um back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">to see how we might frame this you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">the title is</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">wisdom practices and there&#39;s collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">presence form data</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">in insight practice so what do these</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">three have in common</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">very obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">that what ria and nora bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">is um there are the few people that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">that truly understand holistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">truly take non-linear systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">dynamics seriously in their work they do</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">compromise and i know from my</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">own work there</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">are times where you do a workshop and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">there are people very complex thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">intelligence that do a lot of their dual</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">diligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">and they they use the term complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">systems or</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">systems complexity but there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">in which you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">their mind mapping all these feed loops</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">that maybe feed forward and feedback</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">as if theoretically you could get in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">and see all the parts and how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what holistic systems are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t get in between action and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">reaction you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">and so there&#39;s always a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">when you&#39;re working um in this field</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">to try to point out to people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">no that&#39;s not what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">like no that&#39;s just not it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">um and it&#39;s frustrating because these</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">are people who really do their due</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">diligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">put a lot of work and effort into it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">yet there&#39;s a kind of a hard boundary</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">they&#39;re just not in this holistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">non-linear approach they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">and i know that rhea</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">has is uncompromised</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">because she point this out in our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">work together</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">and the first time i met nora i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">asking her about her father</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">and i was saying um</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">you know it&#39;s hard to read him because</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">he uses terms like cybernetics and i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">like well what is he really getting at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">and she just laid out this view of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">the nature of reality the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">um that was truly in the in what i call</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">holistic complexity i just used that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">term to separate it from</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">systemic complexity um and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of stalling because i nora is</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">going to be here very shortly</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">um but but this is the seed that we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">to try to how can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">how can we better language or point out</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">the difference um</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">and do we have stories or examples and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">how how we</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">how we kind of deal with that in in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">so um yeah that&#39;s what we&#39;re hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">build that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">wisdom skill of truly</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">inhabiting non-linear dynamics in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">holistic system</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:08.319" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">when norah comes in we can ask her the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">same question so my question for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">is like how do you how do you point out</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">the difference like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">how do you help people move from maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">uh where they&#39;re stuck to a view that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">truly</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">uh holistic or non-linear</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">just uh jump in nora has a just arrived</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">i believe</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">zoom panic</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">nothing opens nothing works ah</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">so but but anyway here i am hi</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">what did i miss you didn&#39;t miss anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">i was stalling</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">okay and basically oh there you are and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">basically talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">how we were going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">non-linear thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">and how um i said that i could count on</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">my hands a number of people i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">really don&#39;t come really are don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">compromise non-linear thinking when they</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">address systems complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">um and of course you you two are um</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">two people that that i know that to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">and i was talking about in my own work</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">uh and i&#39;m sure this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">or i&#39;m guessing this is for you too</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">you&#39;ll be working with people</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">and they&#39;ll use the word complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">systems or complex thinking but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">not really doing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">they&#39;re actually can&#39;t you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">lot of like linear</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">if they could theoretically they think</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">they could mind map you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">always coming up with these mind maps</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">you know of all this conflicts and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">how do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">language or what how do you build that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">skill that people can exit that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">you know and i was saying like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">times these people</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">they&#39;ve done so much due diligence they</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">read they study our work</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re still kind of like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">click hasn&#39;t happened where oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">now i get it so that was the uh the ramp</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">up and you know if you have stories or</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">any way we can illustrate this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">oh so many stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">um and and i i guess for me part of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">has to do with um</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">with the tension of being caught in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">where what is expected at a professional</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">and in circles of change making etc</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">not just change making organizational</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">development um</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">academic work around stomach thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">is that there is some way</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">to to solve it um</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">and and there&#39;s something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">entrenched um i don&#39;t know you know we</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">can call it mechanistic we can call it</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">linear we can call it</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">uh whatever whatever that thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:21.839" style="s2">is it&#39;s some kind of control</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">um assumption</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">uh you can use all the vocabulary in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.519" style="s2">you can talk about emergence and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.519" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">interdependency and interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">and interrelatedness and you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">about coupling and decoupling and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">complexity and and the second you start</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">with the idea that you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">a goal</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">more than likely or you have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">measurements</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">in the process of getting to that goal</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">boom</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">you lost it and there&#39;s just not very</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">many circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">in which it&#39;s acceptable to approach</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">the difficult situations of our world</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">without measurements and goals</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know where the issue is is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">is it in the actual perception of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">complexity or is it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">the way that there is an expectation to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">be in the world around it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s some paradoxical uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">reflective</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">issues happening at that level</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.839" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">yeah i want to pick up from there</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">the mold that we are in the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">mold</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">of western thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i learned from you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">bonnie is that very very either or</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s either a solution or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">either not the solution it&#39;s good or</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">it&#39;s bad or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">lighter it&#39;s darker</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">even it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">to actually grasp</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">that you live in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">and that even if you try</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:31.279" style="s2">all these maps or</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">the actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">of of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">and in some way we know that life is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">linear</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">i mean we try to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">friends and relationships and then they</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:54.839" style="s2">stop and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">even against our will and our</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.839" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">but this it seems like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:08.839" style="s2">bring ourselves out of the mold of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">dualistic thinking that is so ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">and to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">adapt something else which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">very fluid and very</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">not clear uh for many people that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">because i think we are educated like</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">okay one</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">one is two and if you do this then that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">which is all that linear thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">and what i find</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">when i try to explain uh the difference</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">complicated and complex as dave snowden</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">brings it that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">let people understand that in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">they actually have agency</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve worked quite a lot with people from</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">the european commission</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">and then they kind of understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">and then they fall back into what we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">in the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">and so nothing can happen so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">and they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">that you never know</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">how the ripples are going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">to ripple out or whatever you do as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">might influence something</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">that to me is is like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">some some some some not some some</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">crucial thing there</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">distinction so um</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">you know yeah you&#39;ll hear you&#39;ll hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">people get more sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">talking about systems thinking so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">control the system</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">then they&#39;ll say like mitigate or we</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">want to be resilient or we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">adapt all these things are hedging</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">that you can hear that they hedge their</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">vet and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">and so i was when i was listening to i</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">was thinking of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">okay we live in a complex volatile world</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">every single person who says that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">whole reason why they&#39;re saying it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">like so what do we do about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">to make it less complex and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">volatile like the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">meme is sits in that frame</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">right so like and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">and and we so we need to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">the mental model behind</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">the discourse and what you said riya</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">it was i think is really um uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">really significant and that is um</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">to have no control to not to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">mitigate to not be able to manage</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have agency and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">is a huge distinction because i know for</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">myself when i get to thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">do we just you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">the the problem see that for me the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">problem with that the way i address it</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">is you in complex systems you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">want to de-animate</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">any of the players let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">and so to think you don&#39;t have agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">de-animates you as a player and says the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">system has all the agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">right but you don&#39;t want to de-animate</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">the system or parts of the system as if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">i can operate on</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">it without some kind of mutuality</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">so i think that was a a big</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">a big distinction and i was going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">like is there a choice possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">in this in complex city and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">this notion well maybe not the agency is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:07.759" style="s2">that&#39;s a really interesting distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">i like to talk about that in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.759" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">um because it i think you think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">paradox right you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">you you are you and and you know bonita</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">is is particularly bonita ish</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">you know and and ria is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">rea-ish</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">um and and that particularity</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">is your complexity it&#39;s your your you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.839" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">know your history</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">your everything is in there the way you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">perceive a situation what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">might do in response to it has</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">everything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">your frame your your language your</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">whatever your dna</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">i mean everything is in there um</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">but when you actually look at where all</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">that comes from it comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:56.000" style="s2">from the contexts around you and so in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">you know you quickly get into a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">of well</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">well is any of this stuff that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">is me</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">actually me or is it from the context</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">and um and i i</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">refer to this as the the paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">um and what&#39;s really useful about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">paradox is as long as you can keep from</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">solving it you&#39;re in good shape</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">um and that is that it it keeps this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:26.720" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">living taught attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.720" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">um and by taught i don&#39;t mean teaching i</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">mean taught as in tight as in as in um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">pulled uh stretched stretched attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">to kind of both as being</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">what&#39;s there yes i am</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">i am um i&#39;m responding to the context</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">that i&#39;m around</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:58.160" style="s2">in that sense i don&#39;t have any agency</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">you know you can vote for biden or you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">can vote for trump</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">choose um and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">is that agency or is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">a choice that&#39;s set up within the meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">context and and and patternings of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">of an existing system so are do you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">free will or is it determined you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">this is old stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">but basically the paradox is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">and um that paradox for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">it is something that keeps um</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">it keeps the humility and it keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">questioning</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">and it keeps the dance and the toggle</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">um between those different processes so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">um i mean i guess it&#39;s harare right</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">who&#39;s talking about free will and he</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">says if you think you have free will you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">um because the especially in an</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">algorithm uh tech space you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">actually making any choices you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">choosing between what&#39;s been given to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">you to choose from</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">but the second you realize you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">have any free will you get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">and and there it is again that paradox</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">so for me this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">ties into um again</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">that that attention to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">a way of being that is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">in constant communication</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">with um the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">and and where they go right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">what you do is not what you do it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">and how that goes to the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">and the next multiple things that how</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">each path</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">enters you into more paths or or enters</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">the situation into more paths how</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">relationships build relationships</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">yeah and i to pick up on that nora i</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">important that to actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">have that holistic complexity viewers</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:13.799" style="s2">as bonnie names it that you start</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">understanding way more of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.799" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">that are constantly going</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">instead of how i used to look a long</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">time ago it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">i&#39;m here and you&#39;re over there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">that&#39;s it as if there was nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">but in and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">if you really embody</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">understand embody complexity then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">understand that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">constant influence going</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">all over the place from you towards you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">that thinking of we are in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">skin and that is me and then if i talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">to you maybe we have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">but otherwise not and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">yes something so fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">wrong is not the right word but that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">work to understand how complex life</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">actually happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">for me it reminded me of something</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">schopenhauer said he said</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">i can walk i can will what i want</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">but i can&#39;t will that i will</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">and so for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">uh it&#39;s trying yes it&#39;s a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">i i see it as tumbling perspectives but</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">proper felt sense on what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">nora</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">which is beautiful and that is um</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">if i look at it from a certain viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.559" end="00:22:20.080" style="s2">the context life is giving me</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t have the choice but to act as if</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.080" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">i were free</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">and that was not up to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">um there&#39;s a larger intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">in that design and when then i ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">myself if i</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">free will yes or no i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">a context in which it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">um known right you just get into pickle</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:55.440" style="s2">some kind of conceptual pickle</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">but you can have these experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.440" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">um you have this strong felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">that i don&#39;t have the choice</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">not to be an agent i don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">choice to be a choiceless</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t have the choice to not have free</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">but there they are i can&#39;t i neither can</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">i get</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:21.760" style="s2">out of acting as if</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">and so for me i always believed the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.760" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">action the felt sense the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">experience more than the pickle my mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">can&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well language is too</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">coarse a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">instrument to solve this pickle but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:38.400" style="s2">you can have these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t want to hedge like then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">an individual that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">the point and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">and i think that like so why does it</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">matter and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">um we would all probably agree that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">relating to holistic complexity is more</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">is has something to do with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:01.760" style="s2">processing your body does or</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">your actions and your feelings and your</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.760" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">senses</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">and if you can learn there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">a sense in which you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">to trust those and it&#39;s not like then</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">you get out of this system</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">and you can pick a direction</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s a way in which your</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">communion or communication with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">shows you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">things that were hidden in plain sight</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">shows you like</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">wow i was running around in circles and</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">really there&#39;s a direct link</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">from here to there that i didn&#39;t see and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">it was easy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">shows you that you make a move</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">and you know like those ripples</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">have more effect on the context than</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">your little move and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">they will be disclosed to you eventually</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:04.400" style="s2">and now you&#39;re starting to feel agency</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">in the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">okay i want to tell a story when i</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">i was training in systemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">constellations</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">some of you might know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">and i always stand confused</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">because my teacher used systemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">constellations and there was</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">systemic thinking and i sensed</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">because i&#39;m a very kinesthetic person</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">there was a difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">and i asked him like why are they using</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">word systemic because to me it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">and he said</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">i think what we mean as</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">is that you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">understand that you&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">you cannot study the system from outside</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">as if there&#39;s a system and i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m always implied whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">i do and that was for me i mean it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how long time ago but</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">that was for me such a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">yeah a deep understanding about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">i i i want to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">into that thing that that bonnie you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">started exploring there</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">around the felt sense and the the stay</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">what&#39;s in there because i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who are so</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">methodology for how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">um and it&#39;s a tricky space to actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">put words on uh because</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:07.320" style="s2">um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">all sorts of of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.320" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">possibilities for responding in in any</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">kind of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:19.039" style="s2">situation and not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:21.159" style="s2">are going to resonate in</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.039" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">multiple contextual processes</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.159" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">and in particular i think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">things for me that there are a couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">things that come up here</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">um and one is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">that it seems to require</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">um you know we like to talk about trust</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">but it seems to actually require</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">a kind of distrust a kind of abandonment</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">of what the given</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">set of explorations might be to solve</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">in thinking okay but i know none of</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">that&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">all of that is going to end up in some</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">sort of reductionist frame</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">and so there is a you know a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">this is something that i think matures</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">and at first it might sound negative it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">might sound</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">um it might sound uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">critical but i actually i&#39;m not coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">from there</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">in in my life my experience with with</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">with the most um</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">sort of singing tingling responses to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">systemic issues those those responses</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">come after you give up on the existing</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">pathways so that seems to be one piece</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">um another thing is that it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">where you think it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">so if you start off thinking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">talking about education</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">or you start off thinking you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">you know a medical issue where</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">that other thing is going to come from</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">is i almost a hundred percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">somewhere else it&#39;s going to come from</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">another context</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s not going to look like any of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">the things on your list</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">of what you&#39;re looking for and and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">there is um there&#39;s that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s another thing that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">with uh recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">those things when they turn up</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">um and that&#39;s for me that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">lifetime&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t something that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:46.480" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">as a profession it&#39;s something in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.480" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">way that you live</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to decide when that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">form of perception or that those habits</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">of thinking about things are turned on</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">or turned off</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s not when you&#39;re on the job it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">not when you&#39;re teaching your systemic</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">solutions course it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">um and so i i guess that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">those things are so interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">and i certainly saw that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">you know with my dad in his later years</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t around for his younger years</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">but it was something remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">because those things would actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">be in the immediate perception for him</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">i have to wait a little while and know</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">that i&#39;m gonna have to get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.039" style="s2">habit of looking for this thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">think i&#39;m looking for so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.039" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">my it&#39;s almost like your eyes have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">retrain</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">to get back you know when you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">especially when there&#39;s an urgent</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">responding to that urgency becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a need to have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">focus move</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">so that these other things can can pop</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:11.440" style="s2">into your peripheral vision</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">um but but where are they how</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">and what does that look like and so for</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">me i think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">that process is a deep one and it takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">a long time and it takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">courage</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">um because</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">usually there is um</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">an expectation that the solution is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">definable in linear relationship to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">has been identified as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.440" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">and generally it just isn&#39;t it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">of the sidelines</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">out of some other context</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">yeah i i wanna i wanna expand on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">negativity</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">because you remain so graceful through</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">um and and kind of like bring this to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">practical affairs and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">and so like um i agree with you you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">to hit bottom</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">like you&#39;re just so tired of doing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not only that it&#39;s in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">direction it exacerbates</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">the problem you&#39;re trying to solve right</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re so tired</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">of of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">the so what happens is like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">working in these spaces people that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">on the stowa</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">or sensemaking community it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">frustrating because again you see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">effort the same kind of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">novelty</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">into the grammar or the or the modeling</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">and yet again and you just want to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">pull</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">me this is my my experience here i just</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">want to pull my hair out</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">and you don&#39;t want to get negative</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">because there&#39;s something in the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">condition that is flourishing and people</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">are trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">and then you have to turn that lens on</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">you and say</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">no it&#39;s okay this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">this is part of it too like like</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">and so the question like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">that i the way i talk about it is you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">oh well one of the things that i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">poisons the well</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">in these conversations when i start</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">pulling my hair out</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">is i have a very strong critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">darwinian attitude of complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">processes because everybody&#39;s adapting</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">to everyone else it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just a global reaction cycle right</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:48.799" style="s2">we&#39;re adapting the climate climate is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">adapting to us</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.799" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">the markets it&#39;s everything it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">you know nuclear weapons and defense</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">and finance and prices and vaccines and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">immune system</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">were in a closed loop and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">in complex adaptive systems thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">say well what do we do now</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">what do we and and and i turn it into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">uh i could try to combine process</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">philosophy with</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">complex thought and say what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">from here</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">well this is a surprise what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">from here and so there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">being rebooted and i like to tell this</p>

<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">fire and where the crack</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">comes is where they head out in the next</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">and he says the reason why he says</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">they&#39;re not stupid</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">really they know the elk drink down at</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">the water hall</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">at four o&#39;clock but if you get in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">direct control mentality then the alt</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">elk gets smarter and the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">gets harder and harder to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">commune so what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">introduce randomness into the process</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">and on the way they discover more about</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">their landscape</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">and they and they improve context they</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">don&#39;t even know they&#39;re improving</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">and the elk don&#39;t just become afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">them and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">the dance and the mutuality</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">is served by inserting by this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">relationship they have with randomness</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">and um and surprise and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">um yeah so when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">um hear people speaking</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">in terms of complex complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s not radical enough it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">in the darwinian attitude and it just</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">escalates</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">it escalates action and reaction cycles</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">to the point that that&#39;s what we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">everywhere now</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">ah that was my negative rant</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">i&#39;ll put it out there i know though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">so frustrating because you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">when you start bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">anything that is you know what we live</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">in a world of direct correctives</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">and if you operate in complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">with direct correctives you</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">are gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">consequences that and consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">that you might be sorry you made</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">um so so yeah detours</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">and and and relational contours</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">and dances and things that were that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">bring the the the expression that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:47.839" style="s2">like to use is that the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">response needs to meet the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.839" end="00:37:52.000" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">but what we do is we make the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.000" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">the response</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">match the shape of the trouble and if it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">matches</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem but if it meets it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">going to meet other things too</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">um but go ahead ria and then maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">can give some examples of that later</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">yeah i interrupted you sorry no</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">no um</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">because i wasn&#39;t i don&#39;t think i was</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">going to say something</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">uh let me check um</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">i wanted actually to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">pick something up from from the what was</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">mentioned before that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">i think you nora meant the fel sense and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">then bonnie said something about</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">embodiment and sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">i would say in in that gap where we</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">actually can</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">act and of course we we live</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">in context that&#39;s for sure and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">drives our choices</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">yes um</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">but there is yeah why do we do what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">why why did i end up here</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">i mean if i look at my history nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">expecting me to be here um i always said</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">i&#39;m just a little flemish girl you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">like from a worker&#39;s family</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:30.560" style="s2">but there seems to be of a sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.560" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">be in touch i call it just life</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">life energy uh and and having a sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">and sometimes a very clear sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what i need to do and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">something i cannot</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">not do if i&#39;m really um</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:40:00.560" style="s2">if i take myself seriously and my senses</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">um and in that way</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.560" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">i i always um</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">have advice for people like make sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">you know your body you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">you know that what are these subtle</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">clues that you can sense in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">but also like what you said nora</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">to actually notice when the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">emergence happened or that that other</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">strange thing that actually helps</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">um you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">sense sensible sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">is a better word i guess to actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">notice like hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">he was something let&#39;s let&#39;s pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">let it flood away with</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">in the normal thinking and oh that was</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">just a small detail and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">we don&#39;t pay attention so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">i want to put a lot of attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">on get to know</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">your instrument your body as an</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.280" style="s2">instrument</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">besides all the thinking of course not</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.280" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">throw that away</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">but to actually uh have that also</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">yeah and i know i think adam roberts</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.079" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">here on this call</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">and i think his work toward you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">trying to language like perception is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">skill he keeps going it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">kind of the this core theme of something</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to work out him in in his</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">work i think it&#39;s a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">you know um this perception</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">you know we think perceptions frozen in</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">time you know by the time you&#39;re five</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:02.800" style="s2">years old or whatever the thing works</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.800" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">and then that then we go on to teach</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">something else but</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">the question is you know i&#39;m writing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">philosophy of education book and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">i argue that perception itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">everything that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:19.440" style="s2">the core self the core perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">sensory motor cell</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.440" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">needs to develop over time along with</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">than the other layers</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just a step like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">development okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">you can walk your mouth works right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">can see things</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">and then now we&#39;re going to pile things</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">um and our dogs are going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:46.160" style="s2">so i&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.800" style="s2">it&#39;s great when you&#39;re trying to talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">about language and your dogs just</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">kick in um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">so yeah i i guess what i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">kind of bring in there is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s also back to that context thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">like how much of the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">that you or i or any one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">uh you know us or anyone sees the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">actually them seeing the world and how</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">much of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">perception is actually shared perception</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">and i think this is where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">sometimes when i want to pull my hair</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">um bonnie it&#39;s it&#39;s at this place</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">where um there&#39;s a shared perception</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m not i&#39;m not i i you know for</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">i&#39;m on the other side of a one-way valve</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">and i can&#39;t go back to perceiving it</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">and i get i i feel um</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">i guess that recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">perception isn&#39;t something that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">at the level of individual</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">and so when we talk about how it grows</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">it&#39;s also about how it&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">in between us over time</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">um you know words that come into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">language or</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">or concepts that come into culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">or or experiences that are shared</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">that shift the ability to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s that you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">when you add a coronavirus to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">the perception that suddenly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">way of actually of of perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">right if you happen to be looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">not for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">but if you happen to be looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">and that sheds a very different light on</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">education it sheds a very different</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">light on economy</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">it sheds a very different light on on</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">um systemic racism for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">the way that it was possible to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">systemic racism</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">after the coronavirus was different</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like the alchemy of perception</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">and then it was it because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">people were looking at the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">issues suddenly it was possible to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:28.400" style="s2">you know something else happen so this</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.400" style="s2">this thing it had always been there</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.480" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">so i think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">i guess one of the reasons i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">saying this is that i i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">really careful about getting somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">into um a linear education process</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">for how to perceive in this way or that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">levels of ability to perceive in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.079" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">way and that they can be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">identified</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">um which which drives me crazy</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">because i you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">work with little kids who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">really fantastic trans contextual</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">perception um</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">and description and people from lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">different cultures at</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">many different education levels and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">levels of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">experience of betrayal in the systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">and and levels of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">living in levels of emergency that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">would might think would preclude the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">possibility to have such</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">beautiful abstract thinking and to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">the luxury of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">pontificating and exploring in this way</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">when you have to actually deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">in your face emergency and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">yet in those moments there are</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">a lot of people who are right on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">um so i just wanted to say that because</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:49.040" style="s2">it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">it can be perceived that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.040" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">leveling up and i don&#39;t i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">the wrong metaphor to bring in so i just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">want to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">so that we have it in our yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">uh</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">we engage in non-linear thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s something we can rift on</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">while we have some questions</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">make an adjustment here why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">move on to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.319" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">all right jacob you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.720" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">hi there hi ladies</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.839" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">so don&#39;t take this personally because</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just a general frustration i have</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m seeing it play out a bit here</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">and maybe you can clear it up and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">do this thing completely different i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">open to that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">but i hear this thing happening where</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:41.760" style="s2">like i hear all these ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">some of them are good some are bad right</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">some and those those</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">the bad ones are good and the good ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">are good the ones that i hate are the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">super contradictive so you have like</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard like at least 74 ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">contradict each other here</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">out of the same mouth and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">thanks for laughing because this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">good i hope you see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">coming from a good place i just care</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">um is what i see happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a contradictory idea and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">then people claim paradox it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">well oh there&#39;s paradoxes in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">universe and we forgive ourselves for</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">our contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">because actually paradoxes are really</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">really rare they&#39;re like rare birds that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">are beautiful and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">like you can&#39;t claim them all the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">like a sparrow isn&#39;t a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m saying like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">they&#39;re rare birds</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">and so what&#39;s mostly happening is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">contradictions are being called</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:32.559" style="s2">paradoxes because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">you call contradictions paradoxes then</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.559" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">you leave them alone</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">but you need to if you know something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">not a paradox but a contradiction you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">have to you have to confront it and deal</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">so do you have a mechanism in place when</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking and listening to make a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">distinction between paradox and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t we shouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">talk i mean i take that back</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">but we shouldn&#39;t be in authority because</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">we have to be able to do that so do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">have some sort of mechanism in place</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">that can do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">thanks thanks for listening yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s where um</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">you can bring that kind of rigor to this</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">work and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">um i agree with you that most paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">are contradictions i use the word pickle</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">most contradictions that we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">you can see that the semantic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">basically using words from one mental</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:30.160" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">and making some kind of category error</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.160" end="00:51:34.559" style="s2">in another mental model</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">and you haven&#39;t you haven&#39;t i call it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">semantic mapping you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">cleared out the clutter so you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">the word for example</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">uh we made one distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">agency and control</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">okay so what you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">in fact most if not all of them get</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">solved i don&#39;t actually believe that in</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">that in the end you hold paradox so if</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">you look at the work of ralph stacy</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s where he gets to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">but there&#39;s a move in which you can see</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">the paradox arises in a context a mental</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">model that you&#39;ve set up</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">that necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">moves you toward paradox if you reason</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:17.839" style="s2">within it</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">and if you can see the limitations of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.839" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">your mental model</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">then the paradox goes away or the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">contradiction i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about those things we call</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">that you are saying are contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">um so there is a metacognitive move that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">will resolve</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">in my opinion all of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">but you have to see you&#39;ve set up the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">pickle in the first place by the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">you&#39;re semantically mapping within a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">metal</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:55.839" style="s2">mental model so for example i&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">you just an easy one</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.839" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">people might say something and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">that what they&#39;re saying is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">they can only say that if they have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">mental model of a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">you can hardly say it you can hardly</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">say this happens because or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">without inserting this mental model of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">and because you&#39;re trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">holistic emergence</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">but you&#39;re somehow implied this meant</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">this this theory of change this theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">of causation you&#39;ll come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll realize oh i can&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">and hope and hold on to the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">structure of this theory of causation</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">without coming to a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.160" style="s2">hence i need a brand new theory of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">causation</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.160" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">so there are people working in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:57.359" style="s2">field that say what&#39;s the causal theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">in this domain that doesn&#39;t lead to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.359" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of that kind of work so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">you&#39;re very bright to bring this up</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">um and um</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">yeah so so that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">if you wanted to actually say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">capable of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:19.839" style="s2">we&#39;re capable of grasping this moving</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">from the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.839" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">kind of relationship to this to</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">something more metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">um that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">career uh that that you could use it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">um but um</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">yeah so i have a chapter coming out in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">the meadow modern reader that talks</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">about the metaphysical primes of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">that will never ever ever let you</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">understand what nora bateson is talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">you have to exit them but if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">showed up using language like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">show up we use the language</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">and so when we so we end up with these</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">and so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">yeah so i i like i love that work but</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s really geeky</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s really highly</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">highly metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">i and i love that can i just say one</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">thing i so that was a long answer</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">i wish i understood more of it i would</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">have to maybe listen again but</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">so i think the answer is just simply</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">this you just need a bird book</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">to identify the birds</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">i i don&#39;t get it is that like semantic</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">mapping</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s map it&#39;s semantic mapping</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">semantic mapping that&#39;s what i call it</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">you asked for a methodology yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">semantic mapping that&#39;s rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">ancient history or something but we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">have this conversation another time</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">think thanks you guys yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">but i think what you&#39;re on to is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">something really important</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">because um what could be a paradox in</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">one context</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.680" style="s2">might not be a paradox in another</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:03.040" style="s2">context so</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.680" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">that&#39;s another issue that that is part</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">this you know parsing this out that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s worth paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">you know for me there&#39;s another thing in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">here too is it a contradiction is it a</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">paradox is it a double bind</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">is it a dilemma right there&#39;s all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">different creatures that come in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">pickle</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">bottle um and and how</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">each one of these you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">sort of relational patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">predicament</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">um have um</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">they have something that is like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">portal</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">into a whole nest of relational</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:57.359" style="s2">information through multiple contexts</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:04.079" style="s2">and in that sense you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:06.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.079" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">you know be rigorous with the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.559" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">but i think that what is also</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">interesting is to play with</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">that that entry point into</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">moments where what i would you know this</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">is why i&#39;m interested in warm data in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">is that that which is a an</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">article an artifact of data in one</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">is changed when you put it in time and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">when you put it in</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">in complex moving responding processes</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:41.040" style="s2">so what the heck is information when</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.040" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">um so so for me the these</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">these entry points</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">the the pickles the paradoxes the double</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">binds the dilemmas the contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">the inconsistencies um</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they they move around</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">and in different contexts they</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">they show up as different characters um</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">so i i think that&#39;s important too but</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">in any case they are openings into</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">relational</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">yeah so what is a paradox in</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">newton newtonian physics you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re curious you&#39;re looking around and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">then you find a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">and that paradox dissolves in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">einsteinian paradigm exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">um but when you&#39;re before you get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:38.799" style="s2">new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:41.359" style="s2">your language is going to be paradoxical</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.799" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">because you only have the language</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.359" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">of the old paradigm um</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">yeah so um and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t have all the sophisticated words</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">how it has worked in me is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:15.760" style="s2">i come from the late feminist background</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.319" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">and so my worldview was very feminist at</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.760" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">some point and then there was the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">feminine and there was a masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">and over time i i always explained</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">as i can expand my box and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">suddenly that whole dynamic tension</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s gone at least for me and so there</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.359" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">the individual and the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">having this at certain points in my life</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">struggle with that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">and then so</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">over time i can expand my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">that paradox or whatever we call it</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">is not an issue anymore because i seem</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">to have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">a wider container to hold it all or</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.760" end="01:00:11.839" style="s2">i think and that&#39;s how we move on in</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">in understanding and probably also in</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.839" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:25.839" style="s2">all right uh adam your mic is</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">fixed uh yeah i think so can you hear me</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.839" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">yep you&#39;re good okay um</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">yeah thank you for this um i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:36.720" style="s2">jump right into the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">um we spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.720" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">thinking about or you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">rethinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">how we might salvage uh concepts of free</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:48.319" style="s2">right like that&#39;s kind of where this</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">conversation started</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.319" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">um and i heard nora and bonita talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">well maybe there&#39;s a more kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">limited account of</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">free will as a kind of agency that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">operates within</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">sort of different kinds of determined</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">systems and then kind of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">the nature of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">determined systems is some way of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">reclaiming agency right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re emphasizing the free</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">will poll</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.040" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">the goal seems to be something like can</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">we line up</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">all of these internal and external</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">variables</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">as best we can somehow account for them</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:28.160" style="s2">and then then counteract them right the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:30.799" style="s2">goal seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.160" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for greater control</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.799" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">greater freedom people use the word</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">right there&#39;s this whole work of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">gaining sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">um and it&#39;s kind of like like you were</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:41.440" style="s2">saying like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:43.359" style="s2">you end up creating these like very</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.440" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">extensive maps about things that could</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.359" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">like controlling you so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">control them</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:51.119" style="s2">but i&#39;m wondering what happens if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:54.799" style="s2">kind of like run the system in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">other direction and and actually think</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.799" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">think more clearly about like what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">this is kind of an emergent thought i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">having as as you were speaking</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">is is there a kind of a positive version</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">of determinism just like we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">probably identify that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">negative version of free will there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:14.079" style="s2">freely willed acts that we frankly would</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:17.440" style="s2">wish</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.079" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">people didn&#39;t engage in um and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.440" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">i carry around you know these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">oddball concepts with me like grace</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:27.240" style="s2">and coincidence and flow</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">and these are things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.240" end="01:02:32.480" style="s2">phenomenologically have the character of</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">acting on me or kind of picking me</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.480" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">up and getting me to do things that seem</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.400" style="s2">to be the right things to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:40.799" style="s2">things that i&#39;m not sort of consciously</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">willing and picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.799" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">but the agency feels like it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">from the outside so it has that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">character of like falling in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:50.319" style="s2">determinism basket</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t feel like i&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.319" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">closed off</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">mechanically deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:03:00.000" style="s2">feeling to it it doesn&#39;t feel negative</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:01.039" style="s2">and in a lot of cases it actually feels</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.000" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">by following that larger system or</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">following that nudge</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.680" end="01:03:11.680" style="s2">i&#39;m actually being put to better use</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">than whatever i as an individual would</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.680" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">you know put myself to do in my own acts</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:20.240" style="s2">making choices so um</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like an intuitive nudge or</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.240" end="01:03:24.000" style="s2">inclination</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">or um something like something acting</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.000" end="01:03:27.680" style="s2">within you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not you and so has that character</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.680" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">of you being determined</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">but it also has this like kind of claw</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">like positive quality to it</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:37.760" style="s2">and so i&#39;m just wondering um what do we</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.760" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">are we still in the language of free</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">will and determinism here</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">uh does it make sense to to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:51.680" style="s2">grace acting inside of you as an aspect</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">of determinism that&#39;s positive or uh is</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.680" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">this something else should we use a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">different language than determinism here</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:04:00.960" style="s2">um and so that just kind of was shooting</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">up as you were speaking and so i just</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.960" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">wanted to know what what everybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">thought about that</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">interesting hello</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:21.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve come across that i</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.760" style="s2">for myself um</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.559" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">some of of the listeners know the story</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">that at a certain point i was looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">for the book</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">that would ex describe what i was</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.000" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">uh in groups of people and in dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:42.240" style="s2">realized then that oh the book doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.599" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.240" end="01:04:45.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s probably me you have to who has</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.720" style="s2">to write a book</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.599" end="01:04:48.720" style="s2">and that felt like</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">something as i said i could not not do</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">but deterministic is for me not the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.319" end="01:05:05.599" style="s2">right word</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:08.079" style="s2">um and i have solved it</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.599" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">for lack of anything better in my book</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.079" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">there seems to be a level of of calling</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:18.799" style="s2">you can call it souls calling or</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">um i guess that was the only word that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.799" end="01:05:23.839" style="s2">came</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:23.839" style="s2">close to what i was sensing for myself</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:34.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know because</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.599" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">there&#39;s also something like there</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">is also to make a choice at that point</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">like even if i sense oh it&#39;s probably me</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:47.200" style="s2">to write a book</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">i still have to decide myself there is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.200" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">choice to make to actually go there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">take the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">and take the time to invest in it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:05:59.359" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">all that i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.359" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">any answer but i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">it becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">i see it as</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">becoming more important as we move on</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.559" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">short version</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.880" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">oh did my geeky thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">um yeah so the i think there&#39;s several</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.920" style="s2">different moves that are in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">question as you composed it</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.920" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">adam and i think a couple of them i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">sure you&#39;re aware of it&#39;s do i have free</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:49.760" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:52.799" style="s2">well who is the i right is it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.760" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">is it the persona</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:56.720" style="s2">is it myself and then i wonder about</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.720" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">or is it the universe or is it</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">let&#39;s say the universe is the whole does</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">the whole have free will well it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">to ask if the whole has free will</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">inside the question it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">sophisticated question</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">very limiting limited limiting causal</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:19.920" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.400" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">because when you ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.920" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">you&#39;re basically adopting the collision</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">theory of causality</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">my mind moves my hand my hand moves the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">axe what moves my mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in a very in a linear</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:36.400" style="s2">mental model of causality called the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">collision</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.400" end="01:07:40.880" style="s2">theory so</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i was trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.880" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">earlier it&#39;s so the paradox of free will</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.559" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">is a byproduct of a certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">framework of causality</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">and so knowing that then when i ask</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">does the whole have free will i</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:02.960" style="s2">i expose that because it&#39;s the if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:05.280" style="s2">hole</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.960" end="01:08:06.079" style="s2">then nothing&#39;s going to bump against it</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">to make it</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.079" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">move right so so that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:16.079" style="s2">and so the process move is is the whole</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.079" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:20.319" style="s2">right is there creative acts acts</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">denoble</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.319" end="01:08:28.239" style="s2">novel acts in the universe and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">um then i can i can</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.239" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">i can work from that i can work from</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:34.480" style="s2">it brings us back to surprise and</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:36.239" style="s2">unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.480" end="01:08:38.480" style="s2">since my actions are completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.239" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">unknowable and unpredictable and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:43.279" style="s2">constantly surprised</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.239" end="01:08:44.960" style="s2">the fact that i have no control means</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.279" end="01:08:47.279" style="s2">actually i have free will if i</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.960" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">semantically map it back to the original</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.279" end="01:08:51.759" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">so we put these words in clusters under</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.759" end="01:08:55.759" style="s2">different mental models and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.839" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">this pickle arise</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.759" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">um but if you make these move and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">extract</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:06.319" style="s2">like extract what</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:08.880" style="s2">context what conceptual or</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.319" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2">or perceptual context the question is is</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.880" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">lying on you</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:13.839" style="s2">you can see that you&#39;ve formed you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:16.239" style="s2">created yourself a little pickle on your</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.839" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re asking the question within it</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.239" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">so if you ask it from the hole does a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">whole have creativity</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:28.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s answering that if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">map it back down is the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.000" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">is there free will and but</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">but we&#39;re lacking a causal theory that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:37.679" style="s2">connects that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have a new causal</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.679" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.279" end="01:09:49.600" style="s2">i guess that in in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">what what ria and bonita have said here</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.600" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">i just want to add that i think the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:57.199" style="s2">reason we&#39;re asking that question</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">and that that question is so alive um</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.199" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">in western culture in particular</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">is because there is um</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">a whole sort of nest of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">boy complicated complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">both i would say</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.920" end="01:10:27.120" style="s2">ways of thinking about this question of</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">the self</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.120" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">and what the self can do</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">and what the self has done and how the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">self is</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:38.719" style="s2">in some way identified with its doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s what has</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.719" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">and and what has been done um and in</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:46.719" style="s2">some ways this is tied to all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">hero stuff it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.719" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">um you know it it&#39;s tied to the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:56.239" style="s2">we give out prizes and we say this</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">this belongs to that person or that</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">belongs to this person</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:05.920" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s an awful lot in</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:05.920" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">that sensibility that would inquire to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s two things that i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:18.239" style="s2">we need to ask here one is</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:18.719" style="s2">your question adam you know or or that</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.239" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.719" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">question right both of those things are</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">there what is the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">free will and determinism do we have</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.480" style="s2">either one do they is it possible to</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">have a you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.480" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">a good determinism or but then the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:38.840" style="s2">question i think is important is</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">what kind of what what does it tell us</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.840" end="01:11:46.239" style="s2">about a way of perceiving</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:49.199" style="s2">in which that question is being asked</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.239" end="01:11:52.239" style="s2">and i think this brings us back to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.199" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">beginning of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.239" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">um that gets to that frustration</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">around um getting caught in linear</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">solutioning</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">uh and and we&#39;re back where we started</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">from again and and how to</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">um you know this thing i say it all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:11.679" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:12.960" style="s2">be in the system of the system and think</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:16.239" style="s2">you can change the system</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.960" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">from from within it there&#39;s this matrix</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.239" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">sort of thing happening and not to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">polarize with the system because that</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">makes it stronger</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">not to perpetuate it not to prove it</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">not to um</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">how how do you how do you where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:37.199" style="s2">change i think what we&#39;re asking is</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">where&#39;s the change and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.199" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">participate in something that allows us</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">to get to new patterns of living</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">perceiving relating</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:48.960" style="s2">that are less destructive i&#39;m i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.040" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">when i use the royal we there the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.960" end="01:12:53.360" style="s2">dangerous we</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:54.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s why this this question is</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.360" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">coming up</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.640" end="01:13:08.159" style="s2">it isn&#39;t always that but um</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.840" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">i think i&#39;m gonna stop there but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:12.800" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">if you do something you can see that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.800" end="01:13:16.840" style="s2">did it but</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:18.800" style="s2">if you don&#39;t do something you also did</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.840" end="01:13:21.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:21.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:28.320" style="s2">how to do something about the terrible</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:33.600" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.320" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">patterns of our socio-economic cultural</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.600" end="01:13:40.480" style="s2">systems in a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:44.960" style="s2">that isn&#39;t riddled with so much</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.480" end="01:13:49.600" style="s2">of the blindness</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.960" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">of what it is that could be perceived</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.600" end="01:13:54.320" style="s2">right now um you know in in</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">shakespearean plays</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.320" end="01:13:58.239" style="s2">so often the characters perceive that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">they&#39;re going to get ahead by</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.239" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going to get to be king if they</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:03.280" style="s2">can just kill the king</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">and the perception is if you kill the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.280" end="01:14:06.560" style="s2">king you can be the king</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:07.840" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m being facetious but but</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.560" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.840" end="01:14:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a perception and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:15.199" style="s2">getting back to sort of where where some</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.440" end="01:14:16.320" style="s2">of the territory we&#39;ve covered there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.199" end="01:14:19.040" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.320" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">that is perceived there&#39;s a perceived</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.040" end="01:14:24.880" style="s2">functioning causality</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:27.679" style="s2">and and if that</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.880" end="01:14:28.480" style="s2">perceived functioning causality turns</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.679" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">out to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.480" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">let&#39;s just say limited if not</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:36.239" style="s2">completely destructive and perpetuating</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">of existing systems</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.239" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">um you know i think the</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.840" end="01:14:43.520" style="s2">the question that the three of us are i</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:46.960" style="s2">think working with</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.520" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">is is how to perceive how to be in that</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.960" end="01:14:51.840" style="s2">perception</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">of of seeing more of not all because</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.840" end="01:14:54.239" style="s2">you&#39;ll never see all but not to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">caught</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.239" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">in the the goals at the wrong level um</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">yeah so i think that&#39;s part of this as</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:16.480" style="s2">so we have about 10 minutes left</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.800" end="01:15:19.520" style="s2">um might be a good time to</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.480" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">close out and uh so i want to invite</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.520" end="01:15:23.440" style="s2">uh benita nora and ria for any closing</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.440" end="01:15:29.760" style="s2">maybe we can go around the circle</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">can you say something about what is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.760" end="01:15:32.159" style="s2">happening in the google doc and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.159" end="01:15:37.280" style="s2">just because i cannot do listening and</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:40.320" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.280" end="01:15:43.600" style="s2">chat and google doc but</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.320" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">i noticed there was something happening</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">good to mention that yeah if i can take</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">mike and uv</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">for that yeah it kind of started off as</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:53.280" style="s2">just a series of questions related to</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">linear thinking and non-linear thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.280" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">and then uh also attempting to answer</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:16:01.120" style="s2">them and then just kind of pulling apart</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">more complexity and more questions out</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.120" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">of it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.040" end="01:16:08.400" style="s2">confusing map but and then everyone</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">started con</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.400" end="01:16:13.760" style="s2">uh contributing about i think it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">double or triple the size than when it</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.760" end="01:16:16.560" style="s2">started now</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:19.280" style="s2">so i can see a lot of people still</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.560" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">contributing asking questions</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.280" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">hard to sum it up though it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">non-linear</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">picture of non-linear thinking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:32.000" style="s2">thanks thanks</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">um i just i just want to just bump in</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.400" end="01:16:39.679" style="s2">one other thing on</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">the free will because it illustrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.679" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">also the notion of paradox</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:48.320" style="s2">the collision</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:50.320" style="s2">model of cause and effect you you need</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.320" end="01:16:51.840" style="s2">to have a concept of free will</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:53.440" style="s2">because if there&#39;s no cause and effect</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.840" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">what&#39;s what is free will</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.440" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t will something to</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">and you no longer have the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:01.920" style="s2">determinism</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:05.120" style="s2">so this is an example of showing that</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.920" end="01:17:08.560" style="s2">the paradox the pickle</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.120" end="01:17:09.280" style="s2">is arises from a context a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.560" end="01:17:10.960" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.280" end="01:17:13.199" style="s2">and that is there&#39;s an implicit</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.960" end="01:17:15.600" style="s2">causality that asks the question</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.199" end="01:17:17.199" style="s2">so i just i just thought it was an</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.600" end="01:17:20.800" style="s2">interesting that it came up and that was</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.199" end="01:17:20.800" style="s2">one of the big questions early on</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.719" end="01:17:29.440" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">so what&#39;s the invitation again peter</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.440" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">for us here closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:40.800" style="s2">before we make uh upcoming announcements</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:41.520" style="s2">yeah i guess um we we had an intention</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.800" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">to give</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.520" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">people a flavor of there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.920" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">between a certain type of</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:50.719" style="s2">approach that comes under systems</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.880" end="01:17:55.159" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.719" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">and something that we tried to</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.159" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">exemplify or share a language for you</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:04.239" style="s2">um to um this would be my thing as a</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">strange attractor</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.239" end="01:18:11.520" style="s2">because people are so many people right</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">almost there you know and</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.520" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">uh what kind of world would we perceive</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">if a mass critical mass of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">um lived in that paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">so hopefully we gave you a taste of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:33.120" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.840" end="01:18:42.880" style="s2">provocative i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:44.000" style="s2">the only thing i i would want to also</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.880" end="01:18:46.719" style="s2">add to what</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.000" end="01:18:48.159" style="s2">maria and bonita have said and thank you</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.719" end="01:18:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s been wonderful to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">in conversation with both of you and</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.960" end="01:18:55.920" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:55.920" style="s2">delicious because it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.920" end="01:19:04.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">to actually give</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.400" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">a kind of credibility and authorization</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.520" end="01:19:22.239" style="s2">to another kind of thinking and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:25.040" style="s2">working with systems and i</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.239" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">i think we started off talking about</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.040" end="01:19:29.040" style="s2">that frustration</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">and for me that frustration has</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.040" end="01:19:33.120" style="s2">everything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">what happens when systems thinking</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.120" end="01:19:38.159" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">mechanistic and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.159" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">that something vital something living is</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:46.080" style="s2">lost</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">and and that lost thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.080" end="01:19:53.760" style="s2">is going to prohibit its the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:57.280" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.760" end="01:20:00.800" style="s2">meta substantive aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.280" end="01:20:05.120" style="s2">um deep relational</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.800" end="01:20:08.080" style="s2">and and second order relational change</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.120" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">uh that i think is only possible through</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.080" end="01:20:12.719" style="s2">indirect response</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">and and having said that i i want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.719" end="01:20:19.120" style="s2">give the caveat that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:20.080" style="s2">even um to this question of grammar and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.120" end="01:20:22.320" style="s2">semantics</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.080" end="01:20:24.639" style="s2">even the notion of direct and indirect</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.320" end="01:20:27.040" style="s2">could switch</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.639" end="01:20:27.679" style="s2">so right now that thing we know as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.040" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.679" end="01:20:33.920" style="s2">corrective i i would hope</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:34.320" style="s2">um and and i would suggest may someday</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.920" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">perc</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.320" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">be perceived as a really indirect</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:39.679" style="s2">corrective</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:42.320" style="s2">and those things that are coming in what</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.679" end="01:20:44.560" style="s2">we now perceive as indirect ways</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.320" end="01:20:46.239" style="s2">through multiple contextual processes</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.560" end="01:20:50.000" style="s2">coming together and it comes from</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.239" end="01:20:53.679" style="s2">the outside somewhere or so it seems</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.000" end="01:20:56.719" style="s2">that that is a much more direct way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.679" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">actually uh be in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.719" end="01:21:00.000" style="s2">dance or this interplay with complex</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">systems so</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.000" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">for me i think what i want to do since i</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:08.320" style="s2">um beautiful people here to say it with</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">me is i just want to i just want to give</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.320" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">credibility to that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">because more often than not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">there isn&#39;t credibility there and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">um without that credibility i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:25.440" style="s2">we can begin to move into another</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:26.000" style="s2">um another texture another depth another</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.440" end="01:21:29.840" style="s2">rigor</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.000" end="01:21:29.840" style="s2">of systems thinking</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.560" end="01:21:40.800" style="s2">yeah nice to meet you nora</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.159" end="01:21:42.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen you once but that was a long</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">time ago and</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.400" end="01:21:49.360" style="s2">i also want to name</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">the audience here uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.360" end="01:21:54.639" style="s2">although i haven&#39;t followed</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">the chat because that&#39;s too confusing</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.639" end="01:22:00.239" style="s2">for me but</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.000" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">um that&#39;s part of the complexity it was</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.239" end="01:22:04.639" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">the three of us talking there was a lot</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.639" end="01:22:08.840" style="s2">a lot more going on on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:12.960" style="s2">levels</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.840" end="01:22:16.719" style="s2">and it would</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.960" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">yeah i just talked yesterday with bonnie</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.719" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">like how can we</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:26.960" style="s2">design this that even that complexity</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">and the intelligence that</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.960" end="01:22:30.239" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just bonnie and nora</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.840" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.239" end="01:22:37.360" style="s2">who are the ones who know here</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:41.040" style="s2">that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.360" end="01:22:44.480" style="s2">um and for me that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.040" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">of actually embodying</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.480" end="01:22:48.719" style="s2">complexity is like trusting the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:52.239" style="s2">collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.719" end="01:22:56.639" style="s2">and looking for</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.239" end="01:23:00.639" style="s2">ways that we can maybe need to invent</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.639" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">to to get more of that</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.639" end="01:23:07.120" style="s2">or to i don&#39;t know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:10.880" style="s2">what i&#39;m living with uh inspired by the</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.120" end="01:23:14.800" style="s2">conversation yesterday with bonnie like</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.880" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">can we do whatever the ripple effect is</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.800" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">of this maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">somehow we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">activate it more or something i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.400" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">know</p>
