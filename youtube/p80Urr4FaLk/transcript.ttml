<p begin="00:00:19.840" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">so as i was saying today at the store we</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">and he&#39;s personally inspired me to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:34.480" style="s2">a deeper appreciation of the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">move in the natural world participate in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.480" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">my environment the environment around me</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:42.640" style="s2">that i&#39;m living with</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">in hawaii i climbed up a tree</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.640" end="00:00:48.079" style="s2">and actually fell from a tree</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">on an adventure with rafe and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.079" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">people and since then</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">uh some of the lessons like and just</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:55.520" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">it seems funny to say that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.520" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">like yeah rafe was teaching me movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">and i fell out of a tree</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">but really like in that moment like</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:04.720" style="s2">i had a really gracious fall and i felt</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">quite comfortably and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">inspired me to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">more like risks in the way that i move</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">um and yeah although it was scary it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">enlivening and it showed it gave me this</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">um opportunity to like see how dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">like climbing a tree and playing like</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">that can be</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">um but it also like dialed my attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">another dimension of like i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">that to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:34.400" style="s2">and so what that has done is when i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">been climbing a tree</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.400" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">like allowing myself to be very</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">thoughtful um in the way that i do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">and i mean ultra mindful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s just one thing anytime i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">of rape i remember the time that i fell</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">out of a tree and i also think</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">that my appreciation of how that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:51.280" style="s2">keep me from continuing to want to climb</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">and take risks with the way that i move</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">my body but to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">do so with my attention dialed up</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">so anyway rafe thank you for being here</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">the culture of of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">whatever it is that we&#39;re creating right</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">you know i think in some sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">uh the death of christianity um or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">resurrection of christianity depending</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">on your perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">uh the meaning making the central</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">organizing narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">of the west is um</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">was for a long time based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">christianity and then um</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">that was destabilized this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">nichi&#39;s great uh critique of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">but one thing that was interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">nije is that one of the things that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">wanted people to say uh wanted people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">do was</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">to sort of recover the body right the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">a tradition that was very antibody</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">and um and to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">day i think we&#39;re still kind of stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">this dna where we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">of our bodies as kind of separate from</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">so i&#39;ll try to come back to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">a tighter version at this point because</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">i think this is a really useful thing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">think about but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">you talked about sense making right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">well how do does one make sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">one actually has to move and what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">meaning is in some sense relevance to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">so jj gibson who is the founder of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">ecological psychology he made this very</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">important point which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">when we perceive right sense at the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">level what sense making is is being able</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">to make sense of the world around us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">we use our sentences to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">but in order to use our senses we</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">actually have to use movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">our eyes have to be moving constantly in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">order to generate</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">a picture of the world around us we have</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">we move to here</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">right our kinesthetic structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">receptive senses are all dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">movement your sense of where you are in</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">the world of how you inhabit your body</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">this is all related to movement and then</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">is that we can look at the world in two</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">one is as a world of objects and the</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">and um and that&#39;s the world of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">right and what is the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">that they&#39;re talking about well the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">meaning is relevance to action</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:54.080" style="s2">so peterson was of course one of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.080" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">world of thinking about sense making</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:59.680" style="s2">in the beginning of his book he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.680" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">makes something make sense what makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">something have meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">is its ability to guide you into being</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">that is relevant to that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">thus big zarathustra nietzsche talks</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">when you sit down and you consume</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">wikipedia articles or you watch youtube</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">right and what we&#39;re doing is we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">we are feeding this part of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">the part of us that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">absorbs and becomes better at juggling</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">semantic propositions</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">but your ability to actually achieve</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">anything in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">is always you know more than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">we have to have procedure right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">um you have to actually be able to act</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">something out you have to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">it i can tell you how to do a movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">i can give you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">all the words but it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">can do the mood and doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">you understand what the world looks like</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">and understanding how to apply that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:44.640" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that you understand how</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.640" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">that that that movement has shifted your</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">role in your relationship with the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">so we need movement so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">place to start</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really good i&#39;ve been doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">weekly session here called flowing with</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">unknowingness where we practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">freestyle</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">and do dialogue have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">with beats playing and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">about the freestyle that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">catalyzes for me like moving my hands</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">and my arms and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">bringing in this like rhythmic movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">while i&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">and even just noticing how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">influences the space</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">and like the capacity of the group to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">create a story together</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">and sort of let that that that dialect</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to call it but let the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">dialogue kind of guide the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">that is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.839" style="s2">to allowing uh what we might call like</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">emergence or presencing</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">so i think what i&#39;m interested in is how</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing dialogue we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">how does uh and in your experiences</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">because you really bring</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">like the dialogue practices and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.320" style="s2">storytelling together with movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">for groups of people out in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.320" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">so i&#39;m interested in how our movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">um informs our capacity to like do</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">dialogue and allow what some call like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">regenerative emergent presencing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">type of conversation this generative</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">and how might we continue to practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">bringing more of that movement and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">rhythm into</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">dialogues like this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">first thing that occurs to me when</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">i&#39;m curious everyone in the chat if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">were uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">also at the embodied movement summit</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">that we just put on drop a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">check mark in the chat i&#39;m curious how</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">many of you guys were there but my</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">friend simon thacker</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.000" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">did a really wonderful presentation on</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">the role of dance and gesture</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">uh in the origin of communication right</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">so his theory is that the human ability</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">to mimic</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">and create expressive movement actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">preceded</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">our ability to have articulated language</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:08.800" style="s2">and that we have this incredibility to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">express empathy for other animals and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.800" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">when we&#39;re more passionate when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">more articulate we use our hands more we</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">use our gestures more so the the part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">you that generates</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">uh speech which is very closely related</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">to the part of you that can generate</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">articulated thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">um is is motorically linked to your</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">ability to gesture</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">and so we might then think that fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">in those things is somewhat interrelated</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">so here&#39;s a uh one way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">think that this is a way of better</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">integrating the self</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">one of my big sort of passions is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">that a lot of things that are often seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">as in opposition to each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">are actually meant to be integrated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">not that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">um but we grow through integration right</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">we need to be able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">we need to be able to express</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">masculinity we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">express femininity right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">immature femininity and immature</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.959" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">masculinity and then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">appropriately balanced for you as an</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">individual mature expression of those</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">right right you have to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">assertive and you also have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">compassionate and in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">the mind and the body have to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">expressed and they have to be better</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:32.320" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">so when we have our events we go out and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">we run and jump and climb in a rough</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.160" style="s2">house and we experience intense</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">physicality and we experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">fear and we experience joy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">experience pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">physically and then we talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">right we insight generate off of it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">we ask people to tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">so for instance this year we asked</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">to tell a story of their day as an</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">right so one day we went and had a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">epic adventure</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">and then um we asked people okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">what would this story sound like if it</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">was still remembered a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">from now</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">right it had been turned into this epic</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">adventure that was meaningful for people</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">a thousand years from now</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">how would you tell that story right how</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">would it have been um</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve been shifted and uh and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">next night we had them</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">join in little tribes and did the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">so what we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">is engaging in sense making as you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">engaging in building our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:41.920" style="s2">articulation</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">but we&#39;re intentionally linking physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.920" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">action</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">we&#39;re intentionally linking physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">culture into the rest of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">we talk about this um this balance</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.920" style="s2">four pillars of self-development i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">claiming that these pillars are</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.920" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">but i think they&#39;re very a very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">start and those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">you you need a movement practice you</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">need a mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">you need a um a nature connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:08.079" style="s2">practice and you need community</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.079" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">if you have those things uh you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">doing pretty well so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">we notice is that each of these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">grounds and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">affords greater transformation through</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">each other so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">many people struggle when starting a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">um sitting down and concentrating on</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">your breath</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">can be very very difficult to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">however i believe that if you have that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">same person</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">doing parkour or martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">and you point out to them their ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">to stay in flow</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">and focused and not be distracted</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">in while they&#39;re participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">sport</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">it will ground and make they will see</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">the benefits of the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">much earlier and they will in fact get</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">the medi uh the benefits faster because</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">doing two things that teach you how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">access the flow state at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.440" style="s2">so you i know that when i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">concentrate i</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.440" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">fall or when i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">have a way of typically training</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">concentration all of a sudden these two</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">things are relevant to each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">and then they&#39;re mutually</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">inter-affording and causing</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.519" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">and then we can look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">um time in nature same thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">right i have a nature meditation</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">practice of sitting and listening to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">tune out everything else in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:41.120" style="s2">be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">listen to the birds is dependent on my</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.120" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">ability to have good concentration</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">but those birds are way more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">and informational right and they add so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:52.839" style="s2">much richness</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">and then of course when i have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">to practice all these things become the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">place where i can have real dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">real stories</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">with um with the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">um in my life right so how many</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">conversations have you had about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">weather</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">those can be very very meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">but actually they can be very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">meaningful when you&#39;re a surfer</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">or a canyoneer right how many</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">conversations have</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">you had about the latest tv show the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">latest</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">you know how much more meaningful is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">in your life when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">i did this crazy jump i had this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">sparring session</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">versus these things happened on a game</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">of thrones</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">right um so so we think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">that that in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">uh we actually think the movement is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">right that it&#39;s the first place that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">should go the play is the first place</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:58.320" style="s2">that we should go</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">because fundamentally cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.320" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">everything else about us and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">language right our ability to speak this</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">dialogue we&#39;re doing right now it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">pulling out moving patterns in our head</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a good relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">ourselves and our body</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">um i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">in our in our bodies embeddedness in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">i think it really weakens our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">pursue any of these other things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">there&#39;s actually one of my students</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">robert lansdale who pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">something i really liked</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">uh jordan peterson who mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">famously says</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">if you would change the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">first clean your own room</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.120" style="s2">guiding principles for developing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">movement practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">um it&#39;s i think it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">opportunity right now because</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">gyms closed people not</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">and be available so what are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">guiding principles for developing a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">movement practice that will</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">um work in synergy with that ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">yeah absolutely so i actually i think i</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">a little exercise right let&#39;s let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">embodied here so</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">the breath is always something very</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">powerful to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">and even if you&#39;re you know in solitary</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">confinement you can play with</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">so we&#39;re here we&#39;re in a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">cognitive space let&#39;s tune into our body</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">for a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">notice if you&#39;re breathing into your</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">belly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">into your chest up into your clavicles</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">notice if the sides of your top belly</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">are expanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">notice if the back of your body is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">is there tension anywhere that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">holding with the breath</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">when we you know we live very</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">cognitively stressful</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">at any time that we want to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">body and be with the body</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">a very basic starting place can be how</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">is my breath</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">so i personally notice a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">tension in my chest right now</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">um got a lot of work stress at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">moment and i think that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">expressing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">so i&#39;ll kind of ask my body you know is</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">there tension here that i can release</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">that i don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">and can i return to a breath that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">involves the belly the chest</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">all the way up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">with a pause both at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">inhale</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">and most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">at the bottom of the exhale</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">you&#39;re always switching between a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:42.840" style="s2">sympathetic state</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">right fight flight fight or freeze</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">or a parasympathetic state rest</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">digest breed you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">and even the breast cycle has this</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">yin and yang aspect to it breathing in</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">is yang</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">breathing out is yin it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">and that the pause at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">of our exhale is actually the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">parasympathetic place</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">so when we can extend our exhale</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">and extend that time without stress not</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">forcing it but just allowing there to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">a longer pause</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">it teaches our body to settle into our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">so now if there&#39;s anywhere outside that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">you can take a look</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">and just observe nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">for me my movement practice the origins</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:43.600" style="s2">practice come from nature i was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">who grew up at the end of a dirt road</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.600" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s been in my family since</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">the 1920s since 1920 it was homesteaded</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">and i spent many many years walking</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">through the woods and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">jumping and climbing and roughhousing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">with my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">some ways i&#39;m just doing more</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">sophisticated versions of that now</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:08.640" style="s2">and i find that whenever my practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">becomes oppressive or you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.640" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">tyrannical with myself or i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">overstressed my body isn&#39;t feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">um and i need some way to reset that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">walking in the woods is the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">do that so we&#39;re not going to get up and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">take a walk but we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">imagine what it would be like if we just</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">stepped outside our door</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">and here in washington right now the</p>

<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">and as i&#39;m walking you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">first start walking in the woods maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">you just walk</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">but you might find a fallen log and want</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:03.919" style="s2">and all of us still have that inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">ourselves we just have to learn to let</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:08.840" style="s2">yeah oh man that that reminds me of um</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">khalil gabron the prophet you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">exactly the earth longs to uh</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">wonderful book another one is called the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">spell of descentus</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">by david abrams but it&#39;s basically about</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">that that fundamentally we are supposed</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">to be phenomenologically exp</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">us through our senses and that we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.240" style="s2">become blind</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">to the senses in some sense and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">become illiterate</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">um i had this image the other day that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">that that uh that a modern westerner</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">walking through nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">is like someone who couldn&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">walking to the library of alexandria</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">right there&#39;s so much signal and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">completely blind to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">um in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">in raviki has introduced me to 4e</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">cognitive science right</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">we have um embodiment right</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">and now embodiment is this big word</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">that&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">a major sort of organizing principle</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">around how we can do sense making how we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">can grow and how can gain meaning in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s also embeddedness right so a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">cognitive agent</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:29.039" style="s2">has to essentially be in something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.039" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">motor capacity in order to form</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">its cognition cognition is bootstrapped</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">off of motor capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.520" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just that you have a body</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the body</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">only exists in relationship to an</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">environment it&#39;s embedded in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">right and then cognition is enacted you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:51.600" style="s2">have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">act things out in order to organize and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.600" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">and then you have to um and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">extended right that&#39;s the community</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">aspect we have to be connected into</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">a network of other people so the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">um you know this is a very old debate</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">right in philosophy goes back to plato</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">and before plato but i really like</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">the not the platon platonic viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">but the other viewpoint which is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">the world is always changing right um i</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">can&#39;t remember who it was famous foster</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">you know he was opposed to to plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">ideal ideal performance but he said</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">a man never steps in the same river</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">twice because the river is always</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">changing and so is the man</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">or woman um and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">right like i walk by a tree and i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">oh that tree looks kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">um and then maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what kind of tree it is and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">then maybe i learned some other trees</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">and i realized oh that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">portuguese laurel tree</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">and i and i play in it and i see certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">things in it and then i exhaust those</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">things and i don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">and then years later i come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">same trees and i say</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">oh wow now there&#39;s a bunch of new things</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">here and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2">slowly reveals itself to me and new</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">layers of meaning are possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s through the parkour practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">but also like</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">i could learn about the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">wood in that tree and how it&#39;s used and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">how it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">reacts to fire or how it is used in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">carpentry</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">or i can know what kind of birds feed on</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:25.919" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">berries of that tree or whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.919" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">edible for human beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">or what what season the tree flowers in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">what animals are attracted to those</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">flowers what insects</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s this um</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">there&#39;s an inexhaustibleness to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">natural world where you can observe the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">area over and over again and always be</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">coming back to a new country</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">always be revealing new vistas to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">uh very closely connected to this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">essentially what what verveiki describes</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">as the sacred those things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">inexhaustibly revealing themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">you that you can always learn from</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">i think of um the trees that i try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">i always have a new lesson for me every</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">time that i come back</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">so um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">sacred</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">embodied movement practices and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">um went about them differently</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a big question um i could do</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">like a long very long presentation on</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">the influence of those two thinkers so</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try to to see how short</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">they can make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">i i guess</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">one way to think about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">physical cultures have an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">meaning system</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">that may not be explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:40.080" style="s2">prescribed right or explicitly explained</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.080" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">i actually think that a lot i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">there&#39;s some very deep cultural dna for</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">in a lot of our physical culture that</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">the period of romanticism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">nationalism because</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">gymnastics for instance was formed</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">around the same time as like</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">pan-aryan german nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">by people who were deeply involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">right gymnastics our way germany was</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">like the original founding of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">and um rugby soccer tennis</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">cricket all these games were codified</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">uh during the period the height of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">british empire</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">and you know later they said that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">battle the the battle of water</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">field was one upon the fields of eden</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">right which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">the famous british boarding school the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.279" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">idea being that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">the culture of these young soldiers have</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">been formed by these games that have</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">been created</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s all these interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">things that come out of that and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">i i think that parkour was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">emergent culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">that came out of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:50.080" style="s2">basically a very deeply traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">group of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.080" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">immigrant kids right uh parkour is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">formed in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">ghettos of paris the bandlers of paris</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">um by kids who are a lot of them are via</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">are mixed vietnamese</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">their families can escape vietnam during</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">the the franco-vietnamese war</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">um some of them uh one of them was from</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">new caledonia other ones are from west</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">africa</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">and these kids</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">they they basically were you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">type of kids who might have ended up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">gangs they were struggling in school</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">and they wanted to test themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">see how they can become strong human</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">and so they test themselves with with</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">you know how many push-ups can we do how</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">many pistol squats can we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">how many you know how far can we jump</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">all these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">um and and then that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">those movements some of the movements</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">that they did were picked up and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">spread across the world through youtube</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">and so we kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">only a small piece of it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">were trying to replicate it</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">and it was very meaningful for me in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">beginning but</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">eventually it was like there were i</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure out some of the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">and i started to sort of pull in uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:03.039" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">sense making from like the team the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.039" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">elite sports world right</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">from track and field gymnastics and so i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">got very into like</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">being very goal oriented and having very</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">clear progressions and creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">competitions</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">and there are some aspects of that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">were great but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">it didn&#39;t take me where i needed to go</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">and i got injured a lot and i was</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">it was it was a kind of a game that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">was self-extinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">so then i got really interested in play</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">and play was very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">and it took me a very good direction i i</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">exploded in</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.159" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">i was in nature all the time and i</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">really enjoyed it but there was a point</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">at which i could</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">feel that i was sort of becoming too</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">disorganized there wasn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">structure there was enough clarity about</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">where i was going</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">and i was starting to articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">idea that i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">that there was something bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">just being the best athlete and from a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">technical perspective or winning a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">that we had to be oriented towards and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">i wrote a piece called the self-worth</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">assuming which was about my</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">this idea that that it&#39;s no good to to</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">to just love yourself as you are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">actually have to start</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">cultivating the self in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">will admire</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">into the future and i also had noticed</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">at that time that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">the people were very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">stories that i was telling you most</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">rather than the kind of statistical</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">scientific knowledge that i had</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">and i was trying to understand the value</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">of narrative and story</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">and i listened to the the political</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">aspect of that and it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">but as soon as he got into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">archetypal stuff i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">really hooked so i went and watched the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">whole maps of meeting series from 2017</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">uh the whole um personality series</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">and then i was kind of confused though</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">because i i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">know exactly why i was paying so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">attention to this when it didn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">be really deeply related to the work</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">that i was doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">because before that i was spending lots</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">of time on gymnastics and strength</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:09.040" style="s2">conditioning and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">track and field podcasts and then i went</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">to teach</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">a workshop it was my first workshop of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">the year because i</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:18.240" style="s2">spent about four months off the road</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">between you know the fall and the spring</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.240" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">and i started telling my stories and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">anecdotes about evolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:26.240" style="s2">and how that was related to how we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">became better human movers</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">and all of a sudden this petersonian</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">perspective would</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">sort of assert itself and i would say oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">wow boom</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">this is the same thing same thing same</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">thing and then i sort of had this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">realization that his</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">project of you know helping people</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">recognize how to create the most heroic</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">version of themselves in a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">was essentially what i&#39;ve been doing at</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">just a different level i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">it with the body</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">and then i ran into verveiki&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:02.320" style="s2">and viveki just gave me so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">deeper insight into that and different</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.320" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">ways of looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:08.640" style="s2">right looking at his self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">versus the creation of the heroic self</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.640" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">you know singing about the four e&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">four p&#39;s of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:17.200" style="s2">um i sometimes think i i told raviki</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">this that like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.200" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">jaw that um jordan&#39;s work like built so</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">much cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">architecture in my brain that it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">kind of hard to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">to get to to move it around um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">and so it was like he he created more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">the base for me to interact with john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:34.000" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">but now i kind of think of like jordan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.000" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">work is like being</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">work is more like an ether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">sifting through everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">and shifting it feels like go is</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">happening in my brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">um if that makes sense so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">if that is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">completely coherent story um but</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve found even though both those guys</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">are heady</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of interesting because jordan</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">talks a lot about rough and tumble play</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.560" style="s2">that was one place</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">that we really that i really was</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.560" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the conversations that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">really like to have with him and in his</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">own story</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">you know when he sort of made himself</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">right he got into strength training</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">right and he has a chapter in his book</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">called don&#39;t bother</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">children when they&#39;re skateboarding so</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">when i met jordan we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">um and you know he was super into it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">he&#39;s super excited about what was</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:32.240" style="s2">happening in the parkour world</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">uh and then with john you know he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.240" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">taishi schwann</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">practitioner right he wants to come to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">return to the source</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">um and and you know he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">sort of like as soon as we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">conversation he&#39;s been incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">passionate about sort of forwarding what</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about into this world</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">because he sees it as a big missing</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">cool that was awesome thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">megan will you ask your question about</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">um thanks for all the thoughts so far um</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">this has been really interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">i&#39;m a i&#39;m a music teacher um i started</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">with one child at once</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">um teaching them the violin and asking</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">them to stand up straight and put their</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">feet on the ground and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">play the violin and focus for 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">and then i worked into teaching in quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">big groups</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">um mostly um five to ten year olds</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:29.599" style="s2">interested in what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">mainstream education as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">um and so personally i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">really break out of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">where we um ask the kids to to switch</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">from the rest of their bodies and so in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">the case of violin you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">fingertips um fingertips only</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">and arms and ignore ignore the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">the body i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">personally i&#39;m trying to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">that idea um so i&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in mainstream education</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">which is often seeing the idea that kids</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">need to move their bodies as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">obstacle that we need to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">um and for example there are um there</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">are these web services</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">um that produce short movement videos</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">designed to splice in between your maths</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">lesson and your english lesson</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">in class to get all the kids um you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">standing up and wiggling around for five</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">minutes and then they can sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">put their heads down and do their math</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">um which seems like a i mean it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">it&#39;s very separatist uh way of solving</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:29.520" style="s2">that problem is you know splicing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">little five minutes of movement in</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.520" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">um in between the um the cognitive um</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">tasks um that cut off the body</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">so um i&#39;m wondering if you can if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">know of any um any positive</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">um movements going on in children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">education um any people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">some interesting work with integrating</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">those things together</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">um that you could uh point us to or</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">speak on</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">um i have a few thoughts there so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">the first first thing that pops into my</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">brain is um</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">my friend kelly starrett who had runs</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">the ready state</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">a pretty big name in the um strength</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">condition world he and his wife</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">have a program called uh stand-up kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">and it is a basically they&#39;re replacing</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">sit-down desks with stand-up desks but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">have a kind of special feature which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">that they have a bar on the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">that the kids can put their feet on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">wiggles so it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">a a wiggle channeling device let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">it um but they found that when they did</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">way more cows they were here they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">more more engaged in school um</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">you know many people have observed that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">walking actually helps us</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">so if we need to think about something</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">difficult going on a walk</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">can be a very good thing so in the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">sense um</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">you might find that creating these</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">stand-up desks that have this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">to wiggle</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">actually helps kids learn better um</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">did you guys all get that i kind of i</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">know my my internet just went unstable</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">it said</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">give me a thumbs up yeah we got that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">cool and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">so the next thing i would that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">occurs to me that&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">i mean in a sense music education</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">is physical</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">it is a movement right you are learning</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">to control its motor control versus say</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">gross motor control like i might be more</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">focused on</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">um but the same type of principles apply</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:40.319" style="s2">so i will be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.240" style="s2">thinkers who are applying ecological</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.319" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">dynamics and constraintly approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.240" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">learning and um external cue learning</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">to uh uh the movement space i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">that&#39;ll be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">i know that i&#39;ve run into a few things</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">where we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">music is very close related to the type</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">of things that that we&#39;re finding are</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">are effective in um in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">in learning right so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">traditional movement practices part</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">practice where you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re breaking things down to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:10.160" style="s2">very small pieces and trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">them up</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">um and we are we&#39;ve done the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">in physical pedagogy and in both</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">it appears that generally learning is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">optimized when you actually try to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">on bigger chunks</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole uh a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">breakdown of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">basically having to do with optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.760" style="s2">cognitive difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">and so the level of of challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.760" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">is variable you have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">teaching effect versus the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">um the session effect so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">really interesting finding from motor</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">learning theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty strong disjunction</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">between what&#39;s called the session</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">result which is how much someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">improves in a session</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">and the teaching result which is how</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">much that improvement is retained from</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">session to session</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:00.800" style="s2">so very often what&#39;s called blocked</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">practice like you practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">this scale than the scale than this</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">scale outperforms</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">in session uh result but underperforms</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">in um like long-term result compared to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">actually playing the whole song and just</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">playing the whole song repeatedly even</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">though you make errors</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">um so i hope those are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">thoughts but</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">but yeah stand-up kids is great for</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.960" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">general stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">i i agree with you that that having kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">move and then just do cognition is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">the best way to do it that if we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">integrate these two things if we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">have them say play soccer and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">explore</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">how what soccer informs them about</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">geometry um</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to get a better result</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">right a lot of this learning that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">done around statistics and math has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">just trying to understand all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">physical stuff that i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">lots of snowboarders skateboarders have</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">gotten really good at</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">uh geometry and because you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s how they figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">these giant jumps and how to jump on</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">them and not die</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s a lot of kids who</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">would who would improve much faster if</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">we could leverage some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">hopefully that was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">mark would love to have you ask your</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">sure so um</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:27.040" style="s2">i was wondering if you noticed anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">with uh shifts in perspective from</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.040" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">people who go through your</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">course and what kind of shifts they</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">might have as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">uh spending time in the woods with you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:44.839" style="s2">um that&#39;s there&#39;s lots of shifts in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">perspective right um</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:48.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">so very often people when they look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.800" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">physical practices experience a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">fear and trepidation going into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">and they find through the practice that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">they&#39;re more capable</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">than they realized they&#39;re more robust</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">than they realized</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">and their sense of empowerment and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">overcoming fear and their relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">to fear changes dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">also obviously their relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">nature changes they see nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:15.359" style="s2">they see the natural world differently</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">and then with our longer retreats</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.359" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a massive shift for people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">how they</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">how they perceive relationships and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">is possible for them</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">in relationships and how they can</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">communicate with other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">how they want to be communicated with</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">how much</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">intimacy they&#39;re actually missing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">their lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">and how much</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">that sense of intimacy of the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">being meaningful to other people</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">a sense of having experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">deeply meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">that are part of a group</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that i can i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">there are so many changes of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">that would be really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">to to articulate them all but</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">i guess one way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">is we talk about this idea there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">reconnections right the people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">disconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">alienated as a kind of default state in</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">the modern western world</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">and they&#39;re disconnected and alienated</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">from knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">who they are and what they want and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">is meaningful to them</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">because we have a kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">system that&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">on extrinsic rewards followed by a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">professional world that&#39;s largely driven</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">by perfect</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">extrinsic rewards and without access to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">play it can become very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">be unaware of what is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">know what you like you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">actually motivates you then you just</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">don&#39;t know who you are um so we</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">reconnect with the self obviously</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">we move from a kind of very cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">oriented</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">style of engaging with the world towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">a more body-oriented style of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">with the world so</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:03.520" style="s2">we shift perspective from mental to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:03.520" style="s2">physical in a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">we change our story around play in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">meaning of play</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">and that&#39;s very powerful and we change</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">our story and our</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">our perspective around nature and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">obviously as i said on community</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">and uh what we find is that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">find those transformations incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">meaningful and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">so we&#39;re really motivated to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">more people to experience them</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">awesome personally in one of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">experiences with rafe he had us</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">he guided a group of us through moving</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">by actually like grabbing um each</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">other&#39;s heads</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a specific specific way to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">safely grab onto someone&#39;s head and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">actually guide them</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">around and move their body and it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">amazing for me to realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">uh well one thing the level of surrender</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">that i could feel in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">another person</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">that i wasn&#39;t expecting like i thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2">it would be tense and rigid and scared</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">and so one shift for me was realizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.200" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">like how</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">uh relaxing it was to be like</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">dragged around by my head um in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">and then the other was to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">house to do that and we had others we</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">would grab</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">um at their arm or different things but</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">to realize how</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">foreign another person&#39;s body felt to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">and this how i did i i had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">i didn&#39;t like that like it was like it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">revealed something to me where i was</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">like oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of opportunity for me here</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">like another person&#39;s body feels like</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">um off limits to touch</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">which there are reasons for that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">consent and all that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">very important um but to to to realize</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">how interesting a body is and how i want</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">to be able to move with another body</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">um that was i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">definitely something that stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">and like i had created a curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">that&#39;s led me</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">to yeah like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">connect with people in a way that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">my my words and my language in the past</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">has fallen short</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">yeah and how that intimacy in my life</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">typically has been saved for a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">um small group of people and but there</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">is something that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">opens up with the person and the way we</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">can communicate and understand each</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">other and team up</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">when there are other pathways for</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">yeah so i fell inspired to share that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">and i would love to hear um robert</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">asks question</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">sorry i said in the dark i didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">to seem too creepy when i turned</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">everything on</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">um so my question i&#39;ll just read it the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">body is kind of universal and and can</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">transcend everything and be a frame big</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">for kind of all of us on the planet so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">um do you have any insights or anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">into how like your philosophy can create</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">a common ground</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">or like surprising relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">surprising could be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:00.960" style="s2">negative or anything it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">good necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:05.040" style="s2">yeah the first thing occurs to me is</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">actually that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.040" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">um like i would describe myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">pretty hyper masculine</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">individual without a lot of connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">to the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">uh necessarily and i can find um</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">female minds to be um</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">and through teaching and sharing these</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">things i&#39;ve had lots of really wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">to um to be able to see the world from</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">a woman&#39;s perspective and to draw value</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.760" style="s2">and to grow from it so i feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">easier for me to teach</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.760" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">you know kind of the easiest population</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">for me to teach is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">15 to 22 year old per athletic males</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">they just kind of see the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">i do you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll be loud and abrasive and push each</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">other around a lot in domineering and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">it&#39;s great but</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">i learn a lot more when i work with</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">female students</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">and i really enjoy that so</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you guys a little story about</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">that when i first started teaching</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">we were doing a lot of really intense</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">conditioning as part of our training so</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">for instance we do we&#39;d say okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">only going to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">10 push-ups but every push-up would take</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">like 60 seconds and we&#39;d be in like 30</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:27.520" style="s2">different positions</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">then almost everyone would fail by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">time that we got through these 10</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">push-ups</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">then we do the same thing for squats and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">then we&#39;d go for a run</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">pretty much every female student that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">i&#39;d had in the class had cried</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">one another and a number of years um so</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">i was pretty alarmed</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:53.920" style="s2">by this and i would</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">kind of become obviously alarmed by it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.920" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">apparently during class and would sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">of give too much attention to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">the person who was crying which</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:03.040" style="s2">generally only made it worse</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">and so i had one of our one of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.040" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">apprentices who was a woman come to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:09.119" style="s2">like you may not have cried in several</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:12.559" style="s2">years but</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">um these women you&#39;re you&#39;re responding</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.559" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">probably cry pretty regularly so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">just need to relax and not make such a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">big deal out of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">and so i did and sure enough like they</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">pretty much just stopped crying in most</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">of my classes and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">the problem resolved itself now a few</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:29.119" style="s2">years later i was at</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">return of the source our big event and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.119" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">one of our students had was up ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">me on the creek we were</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">running down wacom creek and she&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">up to a jump between two boulders</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">over a waterfall and one of uh one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">the other students who is also a coach</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">was telling her that she could do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:48.559" style="s2">right you can do this absolutely you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">do this you know he&#39;s encouraging her to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">get ready for this jump</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.200" style="s2">and i i saw that she was physically</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">capable of doing the job</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.200" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">um but i ran up and sort of i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">want her to feel too pressured right i</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t want her to feel like she had to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">do the jump in order to be accepted as</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">part of the group</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">so i said like i know that you can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">this jump and i&#39;m here to support you if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">you want to do this jump but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">have to do the job</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s your choice and she asked me is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">okay if i cry while i do the jump</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">and i said yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">jump jump right like whatever is your</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:23.839" style="s2">own process your own way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">you do that um and so she did the jump</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.839" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">and she was crying when she landed on</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">the other side she was still crying and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">she was laughing and she was crying and</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">we walked away and we talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">that was good and that was powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">it was wonderful and it was great</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">and so that&#39;s become a big story about</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">what we learned from these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">now the story continues because</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">maura now has come back to return to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">source more often than any other student</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">she&#39;s been there for five years in a row</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">and she kind of cringes when i tell this</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">because she doesn&#39;t cry anymore and she</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">does pretty crazy things</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">right last year she jumped to this year</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">she jumped off a 30 cliff for the first</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:04.160" style="s2">last year she did a back flip off of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">rope swing for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.160" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">um but without</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">the education that janine gave me i</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been ready in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">for maura</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">and so uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">that was a connection and awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:23.359" style="s2">has been really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">and i&#39;ve also seen um i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">lots of beautiful moments like that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">year before last or 2019</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">we had</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:37.760" style="s2">you know sometimes conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">gender sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.760" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">violence uh can come up around the rough</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">and tumble play that we do</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">that can be very can be a very revealing</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">place for people</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">and people people had that come up and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:53.440" style="s2">we had some folks in the group who were</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">who were um who were women who were</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.440" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">traumatized and had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">history of trauma and had adopted a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">strong kind of anti-patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">uh belief system um but it turned out we</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">also had men in</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">the group who had been abused by</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">ex-girlfriends and men who&#39;d been raped</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">by women</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">and that came out in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">yeah and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">powerful because there were women in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">group who</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t know beforehand that such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">could happen to a man or didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">felt sense that that was possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:30.559" style="s2">and didn&#39;t really have any empathy for</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">that idea and a man but when they saw</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.559" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">these very strong</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">very capable men um talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">experience it changed things for them</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">and at the same time for those men</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">to be witnessed by women who they might</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">have thought of as their ideological</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">enemies</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">in their vulnerability and not to be um</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">attacked for it and not to be looked</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">down on for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">oh it was incredibly powerful in healing</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">that&#39;s my best answer to that question</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">shared so far</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">um i was wondering because of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">embodied the need for</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">more embodied work in usual sessions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">co-working or collaboration or</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">thinking together in groups but now</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">we&#39;re in this long lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got the places like the store</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">and many other places where we&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">stuck behind screens and will be for a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">while and whether you have thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.440" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">that the the kind of embodied culture we</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">need to start</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">or tactics we need to start introducing</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">in our sessions</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">these long-term virtual sessions that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">probably will be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">yeah i was introduced to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:13.599" style="s2">recently of strong versus weak</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">connection um and i think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.599" end="00:58:17.839" style="s2">powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">to think about the information ecologies</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.839" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">that we&#39;re experiencing right like how</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">much bandwidth how much information</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">am i receiving from you as i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">at you on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">and so one thing that i uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">that i&#39;ve noticed personally is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">like text</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">twitter facebook they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">you can do a lot of commun</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.839" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to get good communication</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">to happen um</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">so i i think that this is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">thing because essentially</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">like we are taking social media and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">much more real in a way um</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">now i&#39;ve noticed an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">which is that people know me from my</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">movement work</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">and they often ask me to come on and do</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">some kind of movement thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">on a call like this and i always find</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">that really uncomfortable because my</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">movement work involves being out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:12.720" style="s2">in nature right</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s like everybody pull up their</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.720" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">and let&#39;s all swing around on it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">work so well</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">or everybody start wrestling with your</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:23.599" style="s2">your partner</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so well on this type of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.599" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">frame but i do like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">um but i i think as i was</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:32.960" style="s2">as i was talking today i had the sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:35.839" style="s2">of like oh we need to do something right</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.960" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">and i think just breathing was a really</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.839" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">good place to start right</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">like sitting here and all trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">breathe together</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s another level of physical</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:47.520" style="s2">connection right there&#39;s a physical</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">intimacy that comes through that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.520" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">obviously we could do basic physical</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:51.520" style="s2">exercises together and we could play</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">with rhythm together</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.520" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">or um you know as tyson might have you</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:56.799" style="s2">guys do you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a beat we&#39;re all experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">the same beat and we&#39;re all responding</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">to the same beat we&#39;re all moving to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">same beat</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">and all these things can increase our</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">kinesthetic empathy for each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">so those are some ideas i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">would be useful as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">game involved with them that involve</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">movement that connect us</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">thank you you&#39;re welcome</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.720" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">good to see you so i was wondering what</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:47.280" style="s2">would you think of that potential for</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">uh mentality especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">outdoors or shared with other people as</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">it gets better for</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">combining like the aspirational and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">imaginative qualities of video games</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:58.559" style="s2">along with their capacity for inducing</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">flow states with</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">an appreciation for nature and athletics</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:06.000" style="s2">especially something like pokemon go if</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:08.480" style="s2">it got better for</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.000" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">affording like a new kind of animism</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.480" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">that helps people</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">care more about the ecology as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting question does that</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">game player</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">what it sounds like and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">who follow me are and love video games</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:36.839" style="s2">tend to have a pretty negative</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">relationship to video games personally</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.839" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">so to back up so</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a video that i recorded a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">years ago that</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">has me climbing through a waterfall</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">right and it&#39;s the same waterfall that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">we climbed through at return to source</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">and when i showed that video to my dad</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">my dad said wow rafe must&#39;ve been real</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">scary climbing up through that waterfall</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">we only ever climbed down you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">so this waterfall is 45 minutes away</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">from my dad where my dad grew up in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">different town</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">buried in the very hard to access area</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">of this park and somehow as a kid he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">found it</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">and climbed it and that was an</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:21.200" style="s2">expression of the type of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">thing that my dad did as a kid right he</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.200" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">they built 70-foot rope swings</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">my dad learned how to do backhand</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">springs and front handsprings</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">um in pe class and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.480" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">he uh when he was like 46 or seven years</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">old he built a a diving board on our</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">property into a new pond that he&#39;d built</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:43.359" style="s2">and i was hanging out with him at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">time and he started bouncing on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.359" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">diving board and he went up and he did</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">a front flip into a dive</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:51.760" style="s2">and i&#39;d never seen him do a flip in my</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">entire life and he just pulled it out</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.760" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">and it was beautiful and perfect first</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:57.520" style="s2">time he did it</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">and you know when i started doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.520" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">parkour</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">you know we i started hearing all these</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:05.440" style="s2">stories from people who had</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">been kids with my dad about the way that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.440" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">he used to run and jump and climb</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">through the woods and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:11.839" style="s2">slide out of cedar trees and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">of how i grew up</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.839" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">up to a point but when i was about 10</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:16.559" style="s2">all my friends started playing video</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.559" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">and they stopped running around in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">woods with me they stopped being</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:24.319" style="s2">physically active</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.839" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">and i think that by and large video</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.319" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">games have been</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">incredibly powerful in moving people</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">from physical activity so a number of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">years ago my friend stefan guiana said</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">to me um</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">has done is they&#39;ve divorced flavor from</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.400" end="01:03:45.200" style="s2">nutrition</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">right so you can get sweetness now</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.200" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">without all the fiber</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">water and phytochemicals and fruit you</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">can get</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">you know um you can get bright colors</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:56.160" style="s2">and get all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">you make hyper stimulating products with</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.160" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">very little</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">nourishment in them and as soon as he</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.280" end="01:04:02.880" style="s2">said that i thought to myself oh like</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">well this is just how you win at</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.880" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">capitalism late stage capitalism because</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">uh pornography is sexuality divorced</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">relationships where all the learning</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.200" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">happens right and video games</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">burst from any physical capacity</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.200" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">so kids spend their time accessing their</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.359" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">flow states</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.720" end="01:04:29.599" style="s2">exercising just their thumbs and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:32.640" style="s2">think that it&#39;s very powerful</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.599" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">in uh the development of a human being</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">generally now a lot of kids have found</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:39.039" style="s2">parkour through</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:40.720" style="s2">through you know mirror&#39;s edge or</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.039" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">assassin&#39;s creed</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.720" end="01:04:44.000" style="s2">um but the amount of kids who would have</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:46.400" style="s2">been doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">parkour naturally not knowing what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.400" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">um before parkour is much higher in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">opinion the amount of kids who</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:55.359" style="s2">found parkour just through one of these</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:57.119" style="s2">things so i&#39;m very negative about video</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">games in general</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.119" end="01:05:01.280" style="s2">i didn&#39;t like them as a kid very much</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">and i was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.280" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">upset when i couldn&#39;t get my friends to</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:06.880" style="s2">go run around in the woods again</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">anymore with me when i when i reached a</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.880" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">stage where everyone found games and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:11.440" style="s2">felt like and i actually believed that</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">my progression as an athlete was</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.440" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">[ __ ] by that</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t have anyone to push me</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:17.680" style="s2">and to do things and to</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">like go through adolescence running and</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">jumping and climbing</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.839" end="01:05:24.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">so anyways that&#39;s my background on it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.640" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">i haven&#39;t thought a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.720" style="s2">generally when i think about the future</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">and augmented reality and vr and all</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.720" end="01:05:35.599" style="s2">those things i just think</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">run as fast as you can away from this</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:38.799" style="s2">right i think the future like uh you</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.799" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">technology peaked in the 90s for me as</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">far as</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">affording human happiness and everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done since has been a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">so uh i may not be the most unbiased</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">person thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:57.119" style="s2">and and you probably disagree conor uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.119" end="01:06:00.559" style="s2">you know you can you can find ways to</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">hybridize these things and make them</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.559" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">great together</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:05.920" style="s2">but i&#39;ll point out all the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">they might not work</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.920" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.359" end="01:06:12.640" style="s2">the stimulation versus nourishment</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:14.480" style="s2">argument yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">agree with that generally i just think</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.480" end="01:06:17.440" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.760" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">they also have the potential to to move</p>

<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">mir&#39;s edge and so on and whether they</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.760" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">would have got into parkour without that</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">i mean who knows maybe maybe not but</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">i think with augmented reality that</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">could be a new thing where</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">it can be outdoors as well versus like a</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:34.240" style="s2">headset indoors</p>
