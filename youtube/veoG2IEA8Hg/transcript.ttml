<p begin="00:00:48.830" end="00:00:53.839" style="s2">technique in order to gain kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.019" end="00:00:58.519" style="s2">coherency and figure out what you really</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.839" end="00:01:00.080" style="s2">want on kind of multiple domains so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.519" end="00:01:01.339" style="s2">going to introduce this exercise here at</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.080" end="00:01:03.979" style="s2">the stoah and we&#39;re gonna do a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.339" end="00:01:05.570" style="s2">kind of we&#39;re gonna do it together</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.979" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">other than that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.570" end="00:01:11.930" style="s2">gonna happen so I&#39;m just gonna hand it</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.040" end="00:01:26.090" style="s2">together will last it&#39;ll probably last a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.890" end="00:01:27.560" style="s2">little bit longer than 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.090" end="00:01:29.750" style="s2">because I&#39;m gonna have several moments</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.560" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">of discussion we&#39;re gonna talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.750" end="00:01:34.190" style="s2">other and there&#39;s gonna be three</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:36.830" style="s2">different exercises that we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.190" end="00:01:38.450" style="s2">through and all involve writing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.830" end="00:01:41.080" style="s2">journaling like a little bit of drawing</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.450" end="00:01:46.340" style="s2">so if you have some pen and paper handy</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.080" end="00:01:48.979" style="s2">that would be helpful I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.340" end="00:01:51.830" style="s2">some folks here are familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.979" end="00:01:54.590" style="s2">idea of bento ISM but I&#39;m gonna just</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.830" end="00:01:55.930" style="s2">sort of lay this out and explain it from</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.590" end="00:01:58.850" style="s2">the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.930" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">and today the exercises I&#39;m gonna lead</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.850" end="00:02:03.830" style="s2">us through are some of the ones I use to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.900" style="s2">even find this idea and to keep building</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.830" end="00:02:10.099" style="s2">on it but first just to start with what</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.900" end="00:02:13.549" style="s2">a bento is a bento is a very simple two</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.099" end="00:02:15.459" style="s2">by two matrix just four boxes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.549" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">something I drew about three years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.459" end="00:02:21.260" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain to the boxes in a second</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:23.629" style="s2">but I you know I&#39;ve been a CEO and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.260" end="00:02:25.159" style="s2">co-founder of a company I&#39;m a husband</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.629" end="00:02:27.320" style="s2">I&#39;m a father I have a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.159" end="00:02:30.410" style="s2">roles in life</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.320" end="00:02:33.410" style="s2">and you know and I was uh I was often</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.410" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">falling short of what I wanted I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.410" end="00:02:38.690" style="s2">falling short of you know what how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:40.340" style="s2">wanted to think about other people how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.690" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">wanted to sort of hold true to my values</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.340" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">and the bento is this way of like how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">I get a how do I really see what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.190" style="s2">on for myself and there and there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">four dimensions there&#39;s here in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.190" end="00:02:54.650" style="s2">lower left now me what I want to need</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:56.690" style="s2">right now I have here my value as show</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.650" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">people the matrix this is what my now he</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.690" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">wants me to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:04.040" style="s2">there&#39;s also here in the bottom right</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">future me this is the me imagining the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.040" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">older wiser version of myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">maybe me 20 years from now and the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">of things that person knows and the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:15.010" style="s2">they see the world and today we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:18.590" style="s2">learn how to listen to our own future me</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.010" end="00:03:20.210" style="s2">there&#39;s also now us the people in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:22.520" style="s2">life that I care about that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.210" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">think about this makes sure they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.520" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">integrated into my thinking and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:29.510" style="s2">could to hear my future us my now us</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">values about deep time and focus through</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.510" end="00:03:35.090" style="s2">the process of this I came to realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:36.980" style="s2">how me being very present as a friend is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.090" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">a key part of spending time with me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.980" end="00:03:41.390" style="s2">like will never look at my phone but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:43.220" style="s2">the same time this also makes me someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.390" end="00:03:45.500" style="s2">that if you text me I might never write</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:45.950" style="s2">you back so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a double-edged</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.500" end="00:03:48.050" style="s2">sword</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.950" end="00:03:49.520" style="s2">and finally there&#39;s future us imagining</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.050" end="00:03:52.940" style="s2">the world for the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.520" end="00:03:55.850" style="s2">so bento is is a very simple 2x2</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.940" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">structure and it&#39;s an acronym for beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.850" end="00:04:01.160" style="s2">near-term orientation what I was altum</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">Utley trying to solve for us how do I</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.160" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">see beyond my near-term orientation how</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.430" style="s2">do I think bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:12.950" style="s2">I think bigger than this moment and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.430" end="00:04:14.270" style="s2">think bigger than just myself too so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna learn how to do this today</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.270" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna do two exercises to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:22.220" style="s2">that and the first comes from a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:24.470" style="s2">months before I had the bento idea I had</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.220" end="00:04:27.890" style="s2">stepped down as the CEO of Kickstarter</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.470" end="00:04:30.440" style="s2">was a strange moment in life and I got</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.890" end="00:04:32.600" style="s2">invited to become to join this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.440" end="00:04:35.150" style="s2">like two-week personal development</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.600" end="00:04:36.979" style="s2">course which I agreed to do because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.150" end="00:04:39.110" style="s2">was a weird moment in life and we got</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.979" end="00:04:40.700" style="s2">this workbook I was so skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.110" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">called discover your</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.700" end="00:04:46.340" style="s2">through north and you cannot believe how</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">hard I rolled my eyes when I first saw</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.340" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">this but I went through this and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:55.010" style="s2">actually a fantastic exercise that in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:57.200" style="s2">being very meaningful and I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.010" end="00:04:59.510" style="s2">it all together it&#39;s it&#39;s very simple we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.200" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">are going to just start by drawing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.510" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">picture of our lives at the very bottom</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:07.580" style="s2">of a piece of paper you&#39;re gonna write</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">bursts that&#39;s your burst and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.580" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">gonna draw a long sort of snaking line</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">up at the top of the page and at the top</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:17.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll just be now now we&#39;ll start from</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:18.470" style="s2">birth and we&#39;ll go to now and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.270" end="00:05:21.230" style="s2">gonna do is we&#39;re gonna take five</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.470" end="00:05:23.150" style="s2">minutes and we&#39;re just gonna draw in on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.230" end="00:05:26.480" style="s2">our version of this just the key</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.150" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">milestones in our life so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.480" end="00:05:30.830" style="s2">for me like this bottom rows getting me</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">here to high school then high school is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:36.620" style="s2">just a big frowny face then I start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">enter you know adulthood and you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.620" end="00:05:42.140" style="s2">draw a little pictures we just try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:43.490" style="s2">express the story of your life and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.140" end="00:05:46.940" style="s2">promise you that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.490" end="00:05:49.220" style="s2">you will you will be surprised I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.940" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">by the kind of kind of perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.220" end="00:05:52.730" style="s2">brings so I just want to start by</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">drawing that so again it&#39;s very simply</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.730" end="00:05:56.510" style="s2">just at the start at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">writing birth and a snaking line up</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.510" end="00:06:00.530" style="s2">until now and I&#39;m gonna set a timer for</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.900" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">question for for me to think about when</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.780" end="00:11:50.770" style="s2">I first went through this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">because I I had assumed what I was proud</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.770" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">of stuff was Kickstarter was starting a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:12:00.040" style="s2">company it&#39;s like the the name brand</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.590" end="00:12:06.850" style="s2">farm in the middle of nowhere and what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.230" end="00:12:09.220" style="s2">found was that actually my what I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.850" end="00:12:12.010" style="s2">proudest of was just moving to New York</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.220" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">City at a young age and that being like</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.010" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">a big risk that I took and and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:20.650" style="s2">seeing that really changed how I thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.710" end="00:12:22.330" style="s2">about myself because instead of say</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.650" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">Kickstarter being the entirety of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.330" end="00:12:26.920" style="s2">identity that was like a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.910" end="00:12:29.590" style="s2">function of actually what was more an</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.920" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">identity to find thing of say leaving of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.590" end="00:12:34.360" style="s2">taking it a big step like that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:27.010" style="s2">looked at in retrospect I had cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.700" end="00:15:30.490" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even remember to put it on the</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.490" end="00:15:34.510" style="s2">through quite easily but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.080" end="00:15:36.490" style="s2">like those are not the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.510" end="00:15:41.530" style="s2">matter it&#39;s the things that you do not</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.300" end="00:15:51.730" style="s2">for me seeing that like my own maybe my</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:54.910" style="s2">proudest thing was not Kickstarter it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.730" end="00:15:58.570" style="s2">was like this move you know if if</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.910" end="00:16:01.180" style="s2">Kickstarter is my identity that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.570" end="00:16:03.190" style="s2">specific kind of success that&#39;s defining</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.180" end="00:16:05.860" style="s2">my identity that that also means other</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.190" end="00:16:08.890" style="s2">people having success like that I could</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.860" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">take as an attack on my identity it sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.890" end="00:16:14.260" style="s2">of has a selfish and very temporal</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.470" end="00:16:16.600" style="s2">notion of the value you have and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.260" end="00:16:19.990" style="s2">this is part of what has us holding on</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.600" end="00:16:22.090" style="s2">to you know relevance or things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.990" end="00:16:23.980" style="s2">that that we that we feel like our core</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.090" end="00:16:26.520" style="s2">to who we are because may or may be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.980" end="00:16:29.860" style="s2">most visible way that we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.520" end="00:16:31.330" style="s2">demonstrated value but really there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.860" end="00:16:36.070" style="s2">probably something that started even</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.330" end="00:16:39.190" style="s2">earlier and and to own that and to see</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.070" end="00:16:40.930" style="s2">that and to see the strength in that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.190" end="00:16:42.610" style="s2">know I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a liberating</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.930" end="00:16:45.340" style="s2">feeling it&#39;s a liberating feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.610" end="00:16:47.170" style="s2">because it allows it allows you to still</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.340" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">have agency and maybe these moments</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.170" end="00:16:52.060" style="s2">where you have that professional acclaim</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:53.530" style="s2">you can accept those as being things</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.060" end="00:16:56.500" style="s2">you&#39;re a grateful for but they are they</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.530" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">are not defining of your story something</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.420" end="00:17:07.690" style="s2">because I was part of the bento group</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.050" end="00:17:09.339" style="s2">yesterday and we did this exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.690" end="00:17:11.800" style="s2">you said that you know this is the creme</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.339" end="00:17:13.930" style="s2">you can keep working on and I I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.800" end="00:17:15.490" style="s2">thought I don&#39;t think once you do it I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.930" end="00:17:17.020" style="s2">think you just do it and then when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.490" end="00:17:18.940" style="s2">started doing it now there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.020" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">practically nothing that I had written</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.940" end="00:17:23.290" style="s2">yesterday on today&#39;s list</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.030" end="00:17:26.800" style="s2">I thought which really was really</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.290" end="00:17:28.450" style="s2">interesting and similarly to what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.800" end="00:17:29.750" style="s2">guess Esther was saying and I&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.450" end="00:17:31.669" style="s2">nominated for an Academy</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.750" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">and a lot of other kind of you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.669" end="00:17:36.620" style="s2">of seemingly big things that people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:39.380" style="s2">impressed by and that&#39;s never it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.620" end="00:17:42.289" style="s2">come up as anything that I&#39;m I&#39;m proud</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.380" end="00:17:44.659" style="s2">of and just thought that was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.289" end="00:17:46.940" style="s2">what he can ask what you think what what</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.659" end="00:17:49.010" style="s2">does what does proud what is proud mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.940" end="00:17:50.510" style="s2">what does it mean to be proud or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.010" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">proud of something can you can you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.510" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">what that emotion is I think for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:18:00.950" style="s2">more about I think I&#39;m proud of having</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:04.669" style="s2">values that I respect and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.950" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">instill them in my kids and I&#39;m proud</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.669" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">when I see those values the positive</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">things reflected in my children those</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.440" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">things make me proud things about you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:20.120" style="s2">know humanity people being nice to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">other when I see you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.120" end="00:18:26.030" style="s2">that those things make me proud of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:29.030" style="s2">people and proud of myself so I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.030" end="00:18:31.880" style="s2">those are the you know words more but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.030" end="00:18:33.260" style="s2">about values for me and then taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.880" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">chances I think as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.260" end="00:18:39.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t feel proud anyway Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:42.980" style="s2">Carolyn thank you anyone else like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.110" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">share also</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.980" end="00:18:53.570" style="s2">oh yeah Dan go ahead I think it was I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:18:56.210" style="s2">have some mixed emotions about this but</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.570" end="00:18:59.650" style="s2">I think it was when I decided to go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.210" end="00:19:01.850" style="s2">China without knowing the language and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.650" end="00:19:05.960" style="s2">knowing the culture just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.850" end="00:19:08.630" style="s2">and realizing after a year there that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.960" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">had completely acclimated and that I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.630" end="00:19:12.740" style="s2">communicating in Chinese and I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:15.559" style="s2">thinking I was serving as a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.740" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">between different cultures and and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.559" end="00:19:22.659" style="s2">was just this kind of leaning constantly</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:29.000" style="s2">leaning into the unknown and and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.659" end="00:19:30.890" style="s2">gaining strength and power from the self</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.000" end="00:19:35.870" style="s2">discoveries that were coming from that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.890" end="00:19:37.610" style="s2">process yeah that&#39;s I I can feel the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.870" end="00:19:39.020" style="s2">truth in that yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.610" end="00:19:42.470" style="s2">mean that that leads me to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.020" end="00:19:43.550" style="s2">question to all of us but just are we</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.470" end="00:19:46.580" style="s2">doing things now</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.550" end="00:19:49.220" style="s2">to be later proud of today you know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.580" end="00:19:51.290" style="s2">we imagine it because on John that said</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.220" end="00:19:56.330" style="s2">like not making the basketball team if</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.290" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">we imagine these you know failures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.330" end="00:20:01.940" style="s2">those being these impetuses you know are</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:03.890" style="s2">we in a place where that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.940" end="00:20:05.809" style="s2">our lives right now or are we coasting</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.890" end="00:20:08.330" style="s2">or I mean probably a lot of us are just</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.809" end="00:20:10.070" style="s2">hiding hiding from a lot of things in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.330" end="00:20:12.170" style="s2">the world but it&#39;s a good thing to keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.070" end="00:20:14.570" style="s2">in mind you know not not that we want</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.170" end="00:20:17.210" style="s2">those crucible moments to happen because</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.570" end="00:20:19.160" style="s2">they&#39;re often quite difficult but there</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.210" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">is something to as you&#39;re saying Dan of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.160" end="00:20:24.770" style="s2">just sort of putting your place in a in</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:26.300" style="s2">a environment of uncertainty maybe with</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.770" end="00:20:28.700" style="s2">more willingness right now we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.300" end="00:20:30.890" style="s2">that kind of unwillingly but I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.700" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">there&#39;s something to that if anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.890" end="00:20:34.429" style="s2">like to share</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:38.570" style="s2">happy happy to hear it I also happy to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.429" end="00:20:41.570" style="s2">keep us moving so you know Caroline mate</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.570" end="00:20:43.730" style="s2">made mention that there was a bento</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.950" end="00:20:53.750" style="s2">journaling exercise every week we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.800" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">like the same five or six minutes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.750" end="00:20:58.190" style="s2">journaling and there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:00.770" style="s2">experience around that and so now I want</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.360" end="00:21:18.170" style="s2">boxes yet because we&#39;re gonna use that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">to brainstorm but the bottom left is</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.870" end="00:21:40.580" style="s2">simple process where you just ask what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">should I do with my energy in the next</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.580" end="00:21:43.250" style="s2">seven days</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.250" end="00:21:46.100" style="s2">thinking a very concrete way of how</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.740" style="s2">should they use my energy for the next</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.340" end="00:22:36.919" style="s2">central to my thinking and future us is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.980" end="00:22:40.279" style="s2">just imagining if if my actions have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.919" end="00:22:42.139" style="s2">larger a larger impact on the world how</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.279" end="00:22:44.600" style="s2">am i stepping into that responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.139" end="00:22:46.700" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna sort of brainstorm a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.600" end="00:22:49.669" style="s2">tease and and only what you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.700" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">is a kind of almost like a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.669" end="00:22:53.509" style="s2">to-do list like a spiritual to-do list</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:55.879" style="s2">in a way where you&#39;re gonna have your</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.509" end="00:22:57.649" style="s2">errands and now me but you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.879" end="00:23:00.169" style="s2">other parts of yourself represented as</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.649" end="00:23:03.320" style="s2">well now that now to get started I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.169" end="00:23:05.389" style="s2">first gonna do a quasi meditative</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.320" end="00:23:06.740" style="s2">experience I&#39;m gonna close my eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.389" end="00:23:08.690" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna ask you to do the same and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.740" end="00:23:12.110" style="s2">sort of we&#39;re gonna move our heads and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.690" end="00:23:13.580" style="s2">what we&#39;re imagining as we all close our</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.110" end="00:23:16.759" style="s2">eyes and first just looking straight</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.580" end="00:23:19.759" style="s2">ahead is I picture that I&#39;m standing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.759" end="00:23:21.789" style="s2">front of a giant bento one of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.759" end="00:23:25.419" style="s2">boxes I&#39;m standing in front of them and</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.419" end="00:23:33.860" style="s2">now me as a mirror it&#39;s a mirror to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.179" end="00:23:36.470" style="s2">on this day on June 1st 2020 and I look</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.860" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">into the now me mirror and I just take</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.470" end="00:23:40.509" style="s2">stock of myself is my mind rested or</p>

<p begin="00:47:56.920" end="00:48:01.150" style="s2">led to the George Floyd situation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.410" end="00:48:04.030" style="s2">the rights they&#39;ve also led to so many</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.150" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">black people being unhealthy that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.030" end="00:48:08.140" style="s2">are much more likely to catch</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:09.880" style="s2">coronavirus and die from it partly</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.140" end="00:48:13.870" style="s2">because of the jobs they have but also</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.880" end="00:48:16.330" style="s2">because of the physical toll that racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.870" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">and poverty have placed on their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.330" end="00:48:25.260" style="s2">in the first place so it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.290" end="00:48:25.260" style="s2">don&#39;t be scared he&#39;ll fix the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.190" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2">yeah I would like to say something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:41.630" style="s2">when I consider how I grew up I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:44.599" style="s2">in South Dakota in a small town where</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.630" end="00:48:47.720" style="s2">everyone was white in this town and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.599" end="00:48:49.220" style="s2">everyone went to church and everyone you</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.720" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">know it was seemed like it was all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.220" end="00:48:55.400" style="s2">same and and to live now in a place</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.410" end="00:48:57.050" style="s2">where it&#39;s so multi diverse I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.400" end="00:48:59.809" style="s2">thinking I need to make more of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.050" end="00:49:01.640" style="s2">effort to just talk up on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.809" end="00:49:04.490" style="s2">when I&#39;m there you know if I see someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.640" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">in need or helping it and to look into</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.490" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">their eyes when I&#39;m passing them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.710" end="00:49:12.500" style="s2">just acknowledge that so that it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:21.170" style="s2">future us is that just we acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.500" end="00:49:24.470" style="s2">our humanists between us this got me</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.170" end="00:49:28.569" style="s2">thinking about dismantling my own white</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.470" end="00:49:31.069" style="s2">supremacy about being better read about</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.569" end="00:49:34.220" style="s2">understanding on my own unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.069" end="00:49:46.280" style="s2">aspects that&#39;s sort of feed into and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.220" end="00:49:48.380" style="s2">allow white supremacy to continue for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.280" end="00:49:51.170" style="s2">it&#39;s for the future us</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.380" end="00:49:58.059" style="s2">it all comes down to recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.170" end="00:50:02.270" style="s2">that chattel slavery wage slavery</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.059" end="00:50:05.240" style="s2">capitalism imperialism white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.270" end="00:50:06.890" style="s2">these all go together and so it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.240" end="00:50:09.049" style="s2">start building a regenerative economy</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.890" end="00:50:12.260" style="s2">based on the theories of planetary</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.049" end="00:50:15.740" style="s2">boundaries and universal human needs all</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.260" end="00:50:19.030" style="s2">being needs and then to stop supporting</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.740" end="00:50:36.200" style="s2">our toxic imperial extractive inhuman</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.030" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">ecocidal system hi I lost I anyone else</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.080" end="00:51:00.470" style="s2">at many points in my life and then at</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.090" end="00:51:03.050" style="s2">the end I thought about how we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.050" end="00:51:07.790" style="s2">religious texts mourning is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:10.220" style="s2">important after war or after loss and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.790" end="00:51:12.070" style="s2">how just that that there&#39;s anger and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.220" end="00:51:14.930" style="s2">there&#39;s confusion but they&#39;re just not</p>

<p begin="00:52:10.130" end="00:52:16.430" style="s2">expand our our self-interest to include</p>
