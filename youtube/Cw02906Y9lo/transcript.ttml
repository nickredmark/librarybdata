<p begin="00:00:15.980" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">this was a reference to my discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">with John for Vicki who described</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">Alexander as a wall of sound referring</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">to Phil Spector&#39;s famous well assumed</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">but I stopped being a record producer so</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:37.800" style="s2">I I and I did like more is more so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">actually I was flattered with it Phil</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.800" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">Spector of comparison but obviously as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:43.829" style="s2">philosopher you prefer to be the wall of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">thought rather than the world son right</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">yeah no kidding even there&#39;s a wall of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">information to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">yeah I think a wall of beautiful ideas</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">would be even better hopefully also</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:58.910" style="s2">coherent ideas I think what striking</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">with us will meet somebody who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.910" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">overwhelming us is there is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">first thing we need to find out is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">whether what they say stick together or</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:09.689" style="s2">not is there a coherent worldview here</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">and that&#39;s when it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.689" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">impressive and and you and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:18.330" style="s2">hanging out now with some truly systemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">thinkers lately we got for them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.330" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">America one of them overseas Joan for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">parking and another one is Greg</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">Henriques who&#39;s built the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">knowledge system and he&#39;s challenging</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">the orthodoxy in the world on psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">because of it he&#39;s also a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:34.770" style="s2">John&#39;s obviously and we got and we got</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">the two guys downing in San Diego we got</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.770" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">Jordan halls and Daniel&#39;s Magdeburg</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">girls work together and see each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">almost every day and what is striking</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">with these guys and you get it because</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in on it is that they all seem to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">have these sort of highly systemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">brains and they come they all come out</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">of complexity science one way or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:56.729" style="s2">Greg bobasa&#39;s arrived in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">psychology John Ferber key in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.729" end="00:02:01.189" style="s2">of cognitive science I&#39;m obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">world of philosophy Jordan and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.189" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">probably don&#39;t even want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">associated with in a specific field yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">they&#39;re that well but when he started</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">with all these Minds is that the very</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">systemic and why we love each other is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:16.920" style="s2">because we we have found out that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:18.989" style="s2">actually these systemic worldviews that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.920" end="00:02:21.270" style="s2">be presented to us all coherent and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.989" end="00:02:23.200" style="s2">obviously then the whole dance to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.270" end="00:02:25.959" style="s2">started is one of compare</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.200" end="00:02:27.879" style="s2">ten studies it&#39;s just like okay where</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.959" end="00:02:29.830" style="s2">did you arrive at this have I understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.879" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">you correctly did I misunderstand you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.830" end="00:02:34.989" style="s2">and is there more to it yeah at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.730" style="s2">that we can put together to put together</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.989" end="00:02:39.220" style="s2">what I think is going to be eventually</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.730" end="00:02:40.840" style="s2">very very impressive possible to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.220" end="00:02:42.910" style="s2">honest about it very impressive jigsaw</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.840" end="00:02:47.170" style="s2">if that hopefully people can then use</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.910" end="00:02:50.530" style="s2">obviously no no I said I said beauty but</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.170" end="00:02:52.599" style="s2">uh you know um I was talking to John and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.530" end="00:02:55.630" style="s2">he was talking about his part his his</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.599" end="00:02:58.870" style="s2">writing partner um Chris Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:03:01.180" style="s2">master uh Pietro who&#39;s kind of a poet</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.870" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2">and he was talking about the combination</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.180" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">of those two guys when they worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">together they end up creating something</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.980" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">more sublime than they could create on</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:13.959" style="s2">their own so so yeah John John&#39;s the guy</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">who who builds the ideas and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.959" end="00:03:19.299" style="s2">Kristof&#39;s he said he furnishes them with</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">with this sort of great great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.299" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">good I mean this you want like that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:26.079" style="s2">bit with John what I look philosopher so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:28.209" style="s2">I am already in a world of art I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.079" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">artist and a competent scientist is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">and that explains why I love working</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:35.019" style="s2">with scientists and and my greatest</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:37.600" style="s2">inspiration for this new really</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.019" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">important hard to write and hard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.600" end="00:03:42.160" style="s2">think book the young so - Chris no have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">challenges other right this is no</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.160" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">mythology of the future so to speak okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">to write that book I am surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:53.769" style="s2">engineers I work with you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:56.739" style="s2">engineering geniuses I work with these</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.769" end="00:03:58.090" style="s2">people who are have systemic minds - but</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.739" end="00:04:00.310" style="s2">they&#39;re completely obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.090" end="00:04:01.989" style="s2">construction and engineering and and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.310" end="00:04:03.850" style="s2">want to get into their minds and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.989" end="00:04:05.410" style="s2">understand why the work the way you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.850" end="00:04:07.959" style="s2">because obviously I&#39;m a phallus</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.410" end="00:04:09.790" style="s2">worshipper I believe that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.959" end="00:04:11.319" style="s2">needed in society today I am a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.790" end="00:04:14.470" style="s2">Zoroastrian even you can&#39;t get more</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.319" end="00:04:16.810" style="s2">phallic than that and I think when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.470" end="00:04:18.970" style="s2">talk about the comparative study between</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.810" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">say John for variks work and what I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.970" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:24.820" style="s2">or mighty me substitute honest about I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:27.010" style="s2">think what is striking there it reminds</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.820" end="00:04:28.840" style="s2">me of where Erich von Stein is a if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.010" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2">think of Erich von Stein as a character</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.840" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">that sits between Jordan Pederson and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:35.320" style="s2">Peter the--</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:38.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m Peter Thiel and Gautam Petersen</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.320" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">is the join for market so Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">is he&#39;s all that is best when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.139" style="s2">actually being held responsible by EDP</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">you feel or Jordan Peterson that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.139" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">he shines cuz he can complement them</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">perfectly in his role but you play that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.780" end="00:04:53.260" style="s2">role between me and John by the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:54.460" style="s2">right now right so so you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:56.139" style="s2">take a stand or anything like that at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.460" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">all you can just bring out the best out</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.139" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">of the Jordan Peter so bring out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:01.210" style="s2">best I&#39;m Peter Thiel but what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:03.720" style="s2">important here is that the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.210" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">picture that comes out is quite dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.720" end="00:05:08.889" style="s2">now there are some really drastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:10.630" style="s2">differences here there are very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.889" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">well you&#39;ve said you&#39;re a fellow fellows</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.630" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">worshipper and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:14.680" style="s2">when I was having that discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:17.500" style="s2">John I kind of brought up your</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.680" end="00:05:19.870" style="s2">vocabulary and I could feel almost an</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:26.280" style="s2">instinctive like no it&#39;s like this kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.870" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">of languages is is is tough for people</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.280" end="00:05:33.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s sexual and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:36.940" style="s2">sexuality is or is thank you that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2">point okay we have probably to begin</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.940" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">with we have to understand but even if</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:43.690" style="s2">John spit all over the place and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:45.430" style="s2">incredibly learned I mean this guy knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.690" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">so much and that&#39;s one of the beauties</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.430" end="00:05:50.680" style="s2">of his mind but when he speaks of his</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">religion which is kind of a chicken race</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.680" end="00:05:54.340" style="s2">why don&#39;t you just say religion if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:56.140" style="s2">mean religion why do you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.340" end="00:05:58.300" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.140" end="00:06:00.460" style="s2">really talk about original that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.300" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">religion than whatever legend we had in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.460" end="00:06:05.220" style="s2">the past that&#39;s what I think at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about certainly I do and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:11.470" style="s2">what religion is here is the essence</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.780" end="00:09:03.220" style="s2">so that&#39;s turned into the conviction</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.580" end="00:09:05.020" style="s2">that you want to live and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.220" end="00:09:06.730" style="s2">the tit in your mouth and as soon as you</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.010" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">lives until the phallus comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.400" end="00:09:23.230" style="s2">the phallus could literally even be your</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">father&#39;s penis walking by you or</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.230" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">something like that but phallus is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">the male grown-up body represents to us</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:32.020" style="s2">when we suddenly discover there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:34.660" style="s2">something there that takes away mothers</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.020" end="00:09:36.940" style="s2">attention and again smothers something</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.660" end="00:09:38.650" style="s2">that I cannot give her so I become</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.940" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">something the plunders the mother&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.650" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">but this magical thing this phallus</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:48.430" style="s2">gives mother the energy and the strength</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:51.900" style="s2">to give me the breast milk and this gets</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.430" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">degrading and in a certain moment the</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.580" end="00:10:12.130" style="s2">we have to push it away with anger to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.760" end="00:10:15.400" style="s2">towards the phallus insight about about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:17.470" style="s2">I guess the struggle between men and</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:20.830" style="s2">everything forward this is the real</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.500" end="00:12:22.300" style="s2">death of God because ultimately and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.830" end="00:12:26.380" style="s2">is what John has been very helpful with</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.300" end="00:12:27.940" style="s2">me in our own conversations it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.380" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">that the child has to become an adult</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.940" end="00:12:31.210" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:33.280" style="s2">then it also means God is nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.210" end="00:12:34.810" style="s2">the names what the adult aspires to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.280" end="00:12:38.440" style="s2">later in life but actually this is step</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.810" end="00:12:40.150" style="s2">in between that I had a far too Western</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:42.040" style="s2">view when I saw this first because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.150" end="00:12:44.470" style="s2">not at all that the adult looks to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.040" end="00:12:45.130" style="s2">become a god no that&#39;s when it gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.470" end="00:12:47.560" style="s2">really bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.130" end="00:12:50.770" style="s2">no the adult looks to the priesthood to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.560" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">the sage as dopher Warka says correctly</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.770" end="00:12:56.770" style="s2">we look to the sage there aspire to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:59.350" style="s2">like the sage so that the adult has</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.770" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">somebody he can mimic the way the child</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.350" end="00:13:04.600" style="s2">mimics the adult yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:08.680" style="s2">development process has been completely</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.600" end="00:13:12.180" style="s2">broken let&#39;s say Ethan the grief is not</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.779" end="00:14:51.959" style="s2">take the first book we wrote in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.310" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">grand narrative you get a synth isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.959" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">book yeah they get this they live this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">they even do it better the improve on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:01.860" style="s2">they work on it but that&#39;s the container</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:03.480" style="s2">they get stuck in because obviously when</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.860" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">we wrote the synth is invoke and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.480" end="00:15:09.510" style="s2">the first part of a trilogy it was to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:12.270" style="s2">first create a container within which we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.510" end="00:15:14.490" style="s2">then put the critique what&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.270" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">with the container why will it not work</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.490" end="00:15:20.250" style="s2">unless it&#39;s modified to then point</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:23.790" style="s2">towards what can and must be done that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.250" end="00:15:26.459" style="s2">why it&#39;s a trilogy so my frustration</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.790" end="00:15:28.200" style="s2">with John is partly by referring to my</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.459" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">own work with John said it is he said he</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.200" end="00:15:31.620" style="s2">gets stuck of the synthesis and book and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:32.550" style="s2">he&#39;s like afraid of taking the step on</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.070" end="00:31:02.820" style="s2">maybe we need to go back to what</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.450" end="00:31:05.340" style="s2">psychoanalysis says or dude essence says</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.820" end="00:31:08.580" style="s2">what so asterism told us all along and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.340" end="00:31:10.410" style="s2">that is there must not be any any idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.580" end="00:31:13.380" style="s2">whatsoever that there&#39;s a direct link</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:15.660" style="s2">between man and God that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.380" end="00:31:18.990" style="s2">there is a priesthood in between to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.660" end="00:31:21.030" style="s2">prevent man from ever seeing God and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.990" end="00:31:22.980" style="s2">priesthood are the ones who do not catch</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.030" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">ildren out there in the world who do not</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.980" end="00:31:27.929" style="s2">fight over heritage - not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.990" end="00:31:30.120" style="s2">intrigues they retract from society they</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.929" end="00:31:32.040" style="s2">step outside society to not be part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.120" end="00:31:33.900" style="s2">the power game that goes on in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.040" end="00:31:35.460" style="s2">square so they stay out in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.900" end="00:31:38.670" style="s2">monasteries they live their own isolated</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.460" end="00:31:41.070" style="s2">lives as a shamanic cast precisely so</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.670" end="00:31:43.950" style="s2">that they can have direct access to God</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.070" end="00:31:46.770" style="s2">so we can go to them when we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.950" end="00:31:50.010" style="s2">communicate with the divine but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.770" end="00:31:53.309" style="s2">divine only comes back and crushes</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.010" end="00:31:56.850" style="s2">straight into our lives yeah you made me</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.309" end="00:32:00.179" style="s2">think of art enter violence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.850" end="00:32:02.490" style="s2">religion to you yeah that&#39;s really if if</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.179" end="00:32:04.200" style="s2">if John for Warka doesn&#39;t get I think he</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.490" end="00:32:05.700" style="s2">does there hold on a minute hold on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.200" end="00:32:09.270" style="s2">minute I lost you when you said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.700" end="00:32:10.470" style="s2">religion just just go back religion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.270" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">religion okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:14.760" style="s2">anything that suddenly can break into</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:17.610" style="s2">your life and you cannot complete it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.760" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">it shakes up completely and it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.610" end="00:32:23.940" style="s2">how powerless you are and it makes a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:26.760" style="s2">respectful of fate goddess so you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.940" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">to sort of read you know you recalibrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.760" end="00:32:31.320" style="s2">your worldview so so the way shockula</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:33.690" style="s2">conscious is that we live in a series of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.320" end="00:32:36.150" style="s2">fantasies and what the real dose is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.690" end="00:32:38.210" style="s2">shakes us up and reminds us that these</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.150" end="00:32:41.900" style="s2">are just fantasies there are religions</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.210" end="00:32:44.760" style="s2">shoot them we create new fantasies out</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.900" end="00:32:47.160" style="s2">of whatever material we got available to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.760" end="00:32:48.809" style="s2">us that we hope think that we hope are</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.160" end="00:32:50.309" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.809" end="00:32:54.509" style="s2">and this is what we perceive as</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.309" end="00:32:55.350" style="s2">transcendence the development so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.509" end="00:32:58.879" style="s2">how it works</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.350" end="00:33:02.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly the way I see John is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.879" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">he practices synth ISM and I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.039" end="00:33:05.669" style="s2">Greg on because this should be called</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.519" style="s2">American citizen by the way centrosome</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.669" end="00:33:11.340" style="s2">is a theological term for anybody to use</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.519" end="00:33:13.830" style="s2">synthesis yeah explain explain a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.340" end="00:33:17.129" style="s2">bit more in nuanced detail what Cynthia</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.830" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">Thurman okay Cynthia so Mr Hague alien</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.129" end="00:33:22.049" style="s2">understanding that the that the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:23.340" style="s2">between fearsome atheism a bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.049" end="00:33:25.379" style="s2">conflict between Christianity and Islam</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.340" end="00:33:27.389" style="s2">it&#39;s a fake conflict they have the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.379" end="00:33:29.369" style="s2">problem that you both got way the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.389" end="00:33:31.889" style="s2">we face him in atheism fearful</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.369" end="00:33:34.470" style="s2">interesting is he&#39;s actually actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.889" end="00:33:37.139" style="s2">what we talked about me and Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.470" end="00:33:40.350" style="s2">is what he conclusion he came to is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.139" end="00:33:42.360" style="s2">that the false dichotomy between between</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.350" end="00:33:44.669" style="s2">theism and non-theism</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.360" end="00:33:46.110" style="s2">you know because Buddhism is usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.669" end="00:33:49.889" style="s2">considered non theism and he said that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.110" end="00:33:52.049" style="s2">yeah actually no that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.889" end="00:33:54.149" style="s2">yet the pointer is what why do we use</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.049" end="00:33:56.129" style="s2">the word God to begin with we use the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.149" end="00:33:59.850" style="s2">word God because it&#39;s the name we put on</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.129" end="00:34:02.580" style="s2">the board absolute so when when you look</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.850" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">at yourself you discover that your chaos</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.580" end="00:34:07.019" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly why our to invent a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:09.720" style="s2">fantasy that you&#39;re somehow organized</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.019" end="00:34:12.899" style="s2">and ordered and that illusion is called</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.720" end="00:34:14.700" style="s2">the self it&#39;s the same thing when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.899" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">then relate to the outside world around</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.700" end="00:34:20.040" style="s2">you you think of the world you discover</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:23.010" style="s2">that the world is chaos you cannot live</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.040" end="00:34:25.770" style="s2">with chaos so you gotta find one point</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.010" end="00:34:28.050" style="s2">in that case any point</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.770" end="00:34:29.879" style="s2">it&#39;s called objectivity up when you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.050" end="00:34:32.339" style="s2">study shuttle con azúcar you gotta found</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.879" end="00:34:33.869" style="s2">one point that you stare at and because</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.339" end="00:34:36.599" style="s2">you can stare at at one point suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.869" end="00:34:38.819" style="s2">the world seems organized to that very</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.599" end="00:34:41.369" style="s2">point is what we&#39;re going to call the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.819" end="00:34:43.319" style="s2">barred absolute in the new book because</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.369" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">the subjectivity that shall be she talks</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.319" end="00:34:47.579" style="s2">about from Lacan he calls the barred</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">subject okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.579" end="00:34:52.129" style="s2">why don&#39;t we just call God than the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:55.500" style="s2">barred absolute so God is just a name</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.129" end="00:34:58.670" style="s2">for whatever order we perceive in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.500" end="00:35:02.329" style="s2">chaos of the world that isn&#39;t us</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.670" end="00:35:03.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the name God okay so you say you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.329" end="00:35:04.970" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in God you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.950" end="00:35:06.859" style="s2">believe there&#39;s some kind of order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.970" end="00:35:08.569" style="s2">the world or wherever you put your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.859" end="00:35:11.240" style="s2">and place that order</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.569" end="00:35:13.910" style="s2">that&#39;s your God that&#39;s all this to it so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:17.319" style="s2">they another question anything personal</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:20.660" style="s2">like you know no that&#39;s just an American</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.319" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">consumerism he was talking about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.660" end="00:35:25.069" style="s2">referring back to my conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:28.130" style="s2">were Vegas okay talking about theists</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.069" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">usually want to personalize God and he</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.130" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">was saying non-theistic goes one step</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:36.049" style="s2">that&#39;s just I know narcissists and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">not interested I find it boring can we</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.049" end="00:35:40.700" style="s2">please stop talking about American</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:42.619" style="s2">individual style for just for once the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.700" end="00:35:44.059" style="s2">problem here also be John for vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.619" end="00:35:46.900" style="s2">he&#39;s going to start marketing his</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.059" end="00:35:49.519" style="s2">American synthesis is that he will only</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.900" end="00:35:53.380" style="s2">he will only be able to market it as</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.519" end="00:35:56.390" style="s2">another critical consumer product as</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.380" end="00:35:58.430" style="s2">another item out in the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:36:02.299" style="s2">market unless he starts to rethink the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.430" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">phallus okay so just step back a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.299" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">here look at the bigger picture it needs</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.140" style="s2">to be explained</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">okay yeah so the bard absolute to God</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.140" end="00:36:12.829" style="s2">this is the name for that synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">essential it&#39;s just a position that wait</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.829" end="00:36:17.089" style="s2">a second if God is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:19.849" style="s2">tried to find in the world and it gives</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.089" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">us order to the world then if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.849" end="00:36:24.289" style="s2">believe this God exists because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:27.710" style="s2">believe there&#39;s only chaos then maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.289" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2">can create God well turns out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.710" end="00:36:32.900" style="s2">what we did all along we create that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:34.339" style="s2">internalization that little objective</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.900" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">fixed object in the chaos of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.339" end="00:36:39.049" style="s2">to have some focal point to look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:41.450" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why we got the phallic</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.049" end="00:36:42.680" style="s2">gaze I&#39;ll go that the creative principle</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.450" end="00:36:44.630" style="s2">or something like that that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.680" end="00:36:46.009" style="s2">obsessed with Google Maps at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.630" end="00:36:48.920" style="s2">because we suddenly discover being</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.009" end="00:36:51.289" style="s2">watched by gods these gods are called</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.920" end="00:36:53.089" style="s2">satellites and we love them to bits and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.289" end="00:36:57.650" style="s2">we perform for them that&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.089" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">Internet that&#39;s a theater so synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.650" end="00:36:59.980" style="s2">basically just says okay we need a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:02.210" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.980" end="00:37:04.130" style="s2">don&#39;t Iraq Isis religion that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.210" end="00:37:06.920" style="s2">like I said that&#39;s bullshit he should</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.130" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">rather say that it&#39;s finally a proper</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.920" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">religion he should dare to declare the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:16.070" style="s2">Christianity in Islam they</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:18.890" style="s2">you know they were popular but they</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.070" end="00:37:21.770" style="s2">weren&#39;t right and usually when things</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.890" end="00:37:25.340" style="s2">get popular he&#39;s usually not right they</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.770" end="00:37:27.350" style="s2">just flattering it was flattering to</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.050" end="00:37:51.860" style="s2">came in 1958 and we got some hope again</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:54.110" style="s2">but we&#39;re in between these two images of</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.200" end="00:38:18.380" style="s2">when we think of the barred absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.850" end="00:38:20.120" style="s2">we think that there&#39;s a god out there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.890" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">off in 1945 we immediately started</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.990" end="00:38:45.320" style="s2">analyzing the Second World War and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.060" style="s2">decided that Hitler will start to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.320" end="00:38:50.300" style="s2">medieval and by the way we had a second</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.060" end="00:38:52.520" style="s2">Alta medieval - and he was Stalin okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.300" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">what John fervently doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.520" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">realize it is precisely when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2">you start creating little playtest</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.390" end="00:39:06.050" style="s2">Gnostic cults and call them religio</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly you open the space for</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.050" end="00:39:10.370" style="s2">another Hitler or another Stalin because</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:12.380" style="s2">if you start saying that the must of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.370" end="00:39:14.090" style="s2">fellows there must have been a Dogma</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.380" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">which associated with fathers an order</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.090" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">there must only be chaos that we embrace</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">did you adopt and something we said that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.310" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">exactly that there was the dogma</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.789" end="00:39:41.920" style="s2">that but the problem is that after 1945</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.180" end="00:39:43.569" style="s2">we declared that Hitler was ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.920" end="00:39:45.609" style="s2">evil the problem with that is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.569" end="00:39:47.950" style="s2">anything that is against Hitler is then</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.609" end="00:39:49.900" style="s2">considered brilliant so what happened</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.950" end="00:39:55.059" style="s2">was we created a culture of mass</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.900" end="00:39:56.920" style="s2">mediocrity ok well maybe just Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.059" end="00:40:00.010" style="s2">were if we&#39;re safe now because Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.920" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">and no no no no safety no you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.010" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">understand you don&#39;t even stand how big</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:06.579" style="s2">this crisis is what actually happened</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.950" style="s2">with America starting with America which</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.579" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">by the way is some mimicking culture the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.950" end="00:40:13.539" style="s2">mimics Europe in many ways but in coming</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">from America in the 1950s comes the idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.539" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">of the teenager waiting we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:20.980" style="s2">that yeah yeah the God said goddess is</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:50.579" style="s2">because wisdom is only earned through</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.020" end="00:40:53.740" style="s2">hard work deep studies and a long life</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.579" end="00:40:54.910" style="s2">mmm-hmm there is no shorter to wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.809" end="00:41:15.880" style="s2">same this is same problem with Islam we</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.869" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">got a problem with the idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.880" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">instant wisdom available to us if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">only beg for it mm-hmm no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">capitalism arrives in Europe and thrives</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">and all that because capitalism also</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">now understand the depth of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s consumer society the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:43.390" style="s2">brought us here the mass exploitation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.970" end="00:41:45.430" style="s2">the planet hey you know climate crisis</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.200" end="00:42:27.099" style="s2">think definitely when you say we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.150" end="00:42:29.049" style="s2">the Messiah that sounds true to me that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.099" end="00:42:31.989" style="s2">is the rostrum in Zoroastrianism is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.049" end="00:42:33.700" style="s2">called the social and what I prefer to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.989" end="00:42:35.529" style="s2">ask them and there&#39;s some over Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.700" end="00:42:37.239" style="s2">is that the juice to borrow the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.529" end="00:42:39.279" style="s2">the social and calling them a friar but</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.239" end="00:42:42.039" style="s2">they want to make him a local phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.279" end="00:42:45.730" style="s2">the Messiah is there to save the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.039" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">people because they are a religious</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.730" end="00:42:49.749" style="s2">minority kinda have a question about</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:52.239" style="s2">that for you actually that&#39;s arrest just</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.749" end="00:42:54.460" style="s2">believe the social as a universal Savior</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.239" end="00:42:57.039" style="s2">the steps in at the end of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.269" end="00:43:08.700" style="s2">that is the you know the exodus is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:12.190" style="s2">offered the exodus is not forced on you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.700" end="00:43:15.160" style="s2">so communism is the name of that plan</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.190" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what my question was</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.160" end="00:43:19.329" style="s2">communism okay how can you be such an</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:23.650" style="s2">elitist in a communist at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.329" end="00:43:26.920" style="s2">because Marx was too okay Rousseau and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.650" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">Mart&#39;s are not the same guys Marx hated</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.920" end="00:43:32.619" style="s2">Roseau Marx said that a small</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:34.539" style="s2">proletariat would take over the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.619" end="00:43:37.450" style="s2">and beat the capitalist at their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.539" end="00:43:39.400" style="s2">game by creating a society where</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.450" end="00:43:41.170" style="s2">creativity rather than capital was at</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.880" end="00:59:09.240" style="s2">Christianity and Islam or the</p>
