<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">and others and this is where the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">signs of it so I started to take lead in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">the research in an important way the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">idea here as well we don&#39;t designate</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">anything as an insect problem we explain</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">to people what the experience of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">insect problem is the phenomenology what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">the experience of an onset problem is we</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">just get people a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">problems and aspects to report when</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">they&#39;re having an insight when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">doing problems well and then we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">because when two things in the brain are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">we finding it just pattern of activity</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">associated with insight and this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">always an important thing in neuro so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">when you take a look at neuroscience but</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">you don&#39;t just want to do cartography</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">and is it theoretically explanatory we</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">already have independent understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.579" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">and evidence or why this activity would</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:02.750" style="s2">actually help to explain the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:05.060" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.750" end="00:02:07.700" style="s2">is under investigation of course as we</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.060" end="00:02:09.350" style="s2">saw both of these things received good</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:12.530" style="s2">empirical confirmation gets a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.350" end="00:02:14.270" style="s2">shift in activation to the right which</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.530" end="00:02:17.570" style="s2">poor probably corresponds to that cast</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.270" end="00:02:19.850" style="s2">feeling of warmth spike because we know</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.570" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">that that has a physiological basis we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.850" end="00:02:23.390" style="s2">have confirming evidence that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:25.100" style="s2">physiological change in current and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.390" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">sudden shift in activity metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.100" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">activity from right to the left of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">right hemisphere would bring about such</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.240" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">a kind of physiological change so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:36.489" style="s2">all lined up very nicely and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">have a lot of independent research</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.489" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">coming out now even biology the lab</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:45.260" style="s2">realization of the two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:50.750" style="s2">lateralization function is an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.260" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">strategy sorry whenever we see what</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:54.020" style="s2">evolution the end up speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:55.730" style="s2">anthropomorphic reactive evolution was</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.020" end="00:02:58.730" style="s2">in agent because our language is agentic</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.730" end="00:03:00.820" style="s2">language we even taste ridiculous things</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.730" end="00:03:05.270" style="s2">like it is raining</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.820" end="00:03:07.370" style="s2">what&#39;s raining okay so Nietzsche once</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.270" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">famously said I think we&#39;re not I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.370" end="00:03:11.950" style="s2">afraid we&#39;re not getting rid of God</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:11.950" style="s2">because we still believe in grammar</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.440" end="00:03:17.660" style="s2">so what please take that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">whatever I have to use this language to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.660" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">talk about evolution so evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:23.390" style="s2">zeroed in on this lateral vibration</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:25.459" style="s2">across many different species with many</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.390" end="00:03:27.290" style="s2">different evolutionary and histories</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.459" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">that come up it very similar so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.290" end="00:03:32.090" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t negate the left atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:34.070" style="s2">seems to be organized for well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.090" end="00:03:36.049" style="s2">problems there&#39;s a narrow scope of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.070" end="00:03:39.140" style="s2">attention it works in a step-by-step</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.049" end="00:03:43.370" style="s2">kind of manner so you can get fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.140" end="00:03:45.650" style="s2">detailed intervention it is very low in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.370" end="00:03:49.790" style="s2">ambiguity tolerance is pursued clarity</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.650" end="00:03:53.480" style="s2">and certainty the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.790" end="00:03:56.170" style="s2">for ill-defined problems so it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.480" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">wide-open attention in works in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.170" end="00:04:01.370" style="s2">after speed it goes to the gist right</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:06.170" style="s2">dairy ambiguity tolerance very wide open</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.370" end="00:04:07.850" style="s2">attention etc and so the shift from left</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.170" end="00:04:10.310" style="s2">to right makes sense and then I pointed</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.850" end="00:04:13.250" style="s2">out how crusty and Kaplan and Simon has</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.310" end="00:04:14.770" style="s2">been is in a purely abstract sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.250" end="00:04:17.410" style="s2">before the grave</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.770" end="00:04:19.630" style="s2">as possible they had predicted that such</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.410" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">a shift between these different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.630" end="00:04:24.850" style="s2">processing should be occurring so all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:26.200" style="s2">this we&#39;re getting very independent even</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:28.570" style="s2">from different theoretical camps</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.200" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">convergence on this being sort of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.570" end="00:04:36.100" style="s2">going on in insight so that seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">very principled answer and has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.100" end="00:04:41.350" style="s2">ongoing research and and this has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">one of the primary areas in which the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.350" end="00:04:46.180" style="s2">neuroscience has been becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">dominant player in insight it&#39;s resulted</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.180" end="00:04:51.760" style="s2">in the recent book by human infinity</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Eureka moment and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.760" end="00:04:56.770" style="s2">idea here is yes we shouldn&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:05:00.040" style="s2">can have a science of insight problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.770" end="00:05:01.150" style="s2">that&#39;s of a statement and when I go</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.040" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">later the top of our relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.150" end="00:05:06.910" style="s2">realization I think it&#39;ll be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">wise to think mystic but perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.910" end="00:05:10.210" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have been trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">anyway we can have a science of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.210" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">of processing that goes into problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">that individuals or whatever subjective</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:39.070" style="s2">problems by our participants and so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.390" end="00:05:40.600" style="s2">brings up the possibility that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.070" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">we have a very standardized population</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.470" end="00:06:41.970" style="s2">measures of cognitive flexibility which</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.470" end="00:06:44.009" style="s2">is becoming an increasingly important</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.970" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">topic in cognitive psychology measures</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.009" end="00:06:50.340" style="s2">of cognitive flexibility seem to be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">good predictors of insects so we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.340" end="00:06:55.770" style="s2">have a really good response to what our</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:58.919" style="s2">us component you&#39;re just doing a primary</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.770" end="00:07:00.629" style="s2">gesture perfect competition yeah but he</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.919" end="00:07:04.110" style="s2">tends to do stuff like that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.629" end="00:07:12.629" style="s2">calling you generate evidence there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.110" end="00:07:14.009" style="s2">thing with you okay so we have a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.629" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">good answer I think to the first of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.009" end="00:07:17.639" style="s2">Whitesburg criticism I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:19.139" style="s2">sort of a good enough answer that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.639" end="00:07:21.330" style="s2">going to go back and sort of throw away</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.139" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">all previous experimental work</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:31.139" style="s2">nevertheless more work should be done on</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:34.550" style="s2">that issue about find you broaden our</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.139" end="00:07:40.620" style="s2">cross conserve our plus cultural study</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.550" end="00:07:43.710" style="s2">problem-solving so we then took a look</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.620" end="00:07:45.930" style="s2">at a oh and sorry I forgot to mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.710" end="00:07:48.180" style="s2">something when we were doing the young</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.930" end="00:07:50.099" style="s2">demon in bone stuff we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.180" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">not only the neuroscience explaining it</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.099" end="00:07:54.810" style="s2">we took a look at the work of tribe</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:57.090" style="s2">Snyder using tecs to actually shift our</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.810" end="00:07:59.750" style="s2">help make it more possible for such</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.090" end="00:08:02.279" style="s2">shifting of activity to do curb and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.750" end="00:08:04.259" style="s2">we&#39;ve got two separate experiments team</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.279" end="00:08:06.690" style="s2">to significantly increase inside</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.259" end="00:08:08.009" style="s2">problem-solving so this is that science</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.690" end="00:08:09.389" style="s2">not only sort of explaining the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.009" end="00:08:11.009" style="s2">phenomena we&#39;re getting to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.389" end="00:08:13.560" style="s2">were funny to be able to generally that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.009" end="00:08:16.439" style="s2">we&#39;ll see another way of generating it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.560" end="00:08:18.749" style="s2">not quite properly but from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.439" end="00:08:22.259" style="s2">the other side we look at in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.749" end="00:08:25.379" style="s2">pick support okay so we then took a look</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.259" end="00:08:27.569" style="s2">at a further criticism from psych and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.379" end="00:08:29.459" style="s2">Whitesburg in 2004 in which confirm</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.569" end="00:08:32.519" style="s2">immobilization do not see doing care</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.459" end="00:08:36.389" style="s2">inside problems like it did for sugar an</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.519" end="00:08:39.269" style="s2">ulcer I pointed out the shooter had two</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.389" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">responses to this one a rational</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.269" end="00:08:44.519" style="s2">response which maybe it isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.410" style="s2">control ordination but the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.519" end="00:08:48.449" style="s2">processing the speed trigger and we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.410" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">independent evidence the predates all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.449" end="00:08:56.189" style="s2">this that then strong support to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:59.250" style="s2">idea that languages per se is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.189" end="00:09:02.250" style="s2">relevant in triggering or impairment of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.250" end="00:09:04.199" style="s2">insight you&#39;ve only seen a competitor so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.250" end="00:09:06.449" style="s2">that part of sugar lined up with already</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.199" end="00:09:09.629" style="s2">existing arguments and evidence and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.449" end="00:09:13.980" style="s2">should it gave another wacky crazy thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.629" end="00:09:17.699" style="s2">about the cosmos somehow shifts in order</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.980" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">to make science harder or something so</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.699" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to put that aside because</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:26.189" style="s2">I find a particular slip sir and like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:28.079" style="s2">said he&#39;s joking but and quite it is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.189" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">is joking that he shouldn&#39;t go out</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.079" end="00:09:35.670" style="s2">socially because it&#39;s just it was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:37.949" style="s2">very poor if he&#39;s not joking that he</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.670" end="00:09:41.100" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t go out socially because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.949" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">losing touch with reality so no matter</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.100" end="00:09:44.519" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:50.690" style="s2">conclusion and Schuler should stay in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.519" end="00:09:53.089" style="s2">should stay in all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.690" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">in order to follow up on that I started</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.089" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">into a critique of the construct of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:01.250" style="s2">verbal overshadowing which I had been</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.279" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">mentioning I was going to do already</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.250" end="00:10:18.769" style="s2">sorry be comfortable tonight one other</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:20.569" style="s2">note I mean one please alright so I put</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.769" end="00:10:22.430" style="s2">it up to you that the verbal part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.569" end="00:10:25.639" style="s2">verbal overshadowing is irrelevant and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.430" end="00:10:28.670" style="s2">should be thrown out already putting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.639" end="00:10:31.129" style="s2">construct into you know significant</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.670" end="00:10:34.459" style="s2">question then I pointed out that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.129" end="00:10:36.939" style="s2">notion of overshadowing runs off of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.459" end="00:10:40.990" style="s2">searchlight metaphor for attention and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.939" end="00:10:45.470" style="s2">while there&#39;s truth to that metaphor I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.990" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">also miss brains and misleads us in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.470" end="00:10:50.750" style="s2">understanding of attention in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:52.189" style="s2">get into that I&#39;ve tapped into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.750" end="00:10:55.069" style="s2">some of the cognitive science around</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.189" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">attention and as I mentioned attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.069" end="00:11:00.980" style="s2">is becoming a very hot topic in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">psychology and philosophy and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.980" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">science in general</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">precisely because sorry this sounds soft</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.389" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">emotional I guess it is but it wasn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:14.329" style="s2">intentions of thought came into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.069" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of emerging evidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.329" end="00:11:18.199" style="s2">on the stock kind of argument that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.069" end="00:11:20.329" style="s2">making in this class that attention is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.199" end="00:11:22.310" style="s2">playing a pivotal role and we have not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.329" end="00:11:25.329" style="s2">paid enough to attentional mechanisms in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.310" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">our understanding of cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.329" end="00:11:29.779" style="s2">partially perhaps and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">what my argument is implying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.779" end="00:11:35.209" style="s2">because we&#39;ve had an overly simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:37.339" style="s2">model of attention at work and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.209" end="00:11:40.189" style="s2">have a look at the work of Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.339" end="00:11:41.590" style="s2">mole who argue that one of the wage wins</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.189" end="00:11:43.510" style="s2">the searchlight metaphor missed</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.590" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">presents attention is it represented as</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.510" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">a singular simple direct process that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:52.390" style="s2">undertake it would be like so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:54.430" style="s2">analogous to like walking or talking he</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.390" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">points out though that attention is much</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.430" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">more like our description like practice</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:02.170" style="s2">or praying but where&#39;s attention is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.540" style="s2">something we do on its own directly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.170" end="00:12:06.190" style="s2">a way in which you do other things but</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.540" end="00:12:07.810" style="s2">specifically what it seems to involve is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.190" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">what he called cognitive unison the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.810" end="00:12:12.820" style="s2">integration of very various processes</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">onto a common goal somehow getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.820" end="00:12:18.310" style="s2">various processors to find a shared task</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:22.960" style="s2">and the goal there end to be Co relevant</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.310" end="00:12:25.540" style="s2">to them I pointed out that a way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.960" end="00:12:27.130" style="s2">understanding how that might work is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.540" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">take a look at the work that plan you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.130" end="00:12:32.740" style="s2">did on attention and understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:37.080" style="s2">attention as what he called integration</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.740" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">I suggested to the dots before Torme</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.080" end="00:12:41.770" style="s2">instead I would suggest something more</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:45.130" style="s2">like fusion and the idea of how subsea</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.770" end="00:12:48.420" style="s2">what attention is it is a structural</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.130" end="00:12:51.520" style="s2">relation and a function between</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.420" end="00:12:52.960" style="s2">subsidiary and folk awareness and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.520" end="00:12:54.310" style="s2">awareness is has to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.960" end="00:12:56.770" style="s2">consciousness is I&#39;m not going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">about what consciousness is here because</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.770" end="00:13:03.250" style="s2">consciousness is the hardest thing in</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:07.740" style="s2">cognitive science and psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.250" end="00:13:12.400" style="s2">philosophy and life and your existence</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.740" end="00:13:14.050" style="s2">so for example just whatever okay how</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.400" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">many of you would take the following</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.050" end="00:13:19.990" style="s2">deal I&#39;ll guarantee you that you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:21.640" style="s2">wealth power and all of the love you</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.990" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">want you just will not be conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.640" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">any do you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:30.860" style="s2">okay now so that must mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:33.050" style="s2">clearly what your consciousness does for</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.860" end="00:13:34.730" style="s2">you what its function is why have such a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.050" end="00:13:42.200" style="s2">great value what is consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.730" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">function it&#39;s most of your processing</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.200" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">you go on unconsciously and what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:50.960" style="s2">consciousness for so why do you value</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:52.670" style="s2">something so much that you have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.960" end="00:13:54.710" style="s2">what it does for you obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.670" end="00:13:56.150" style="s2">an answer to that I mean I don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.710" end="00:13:57.470" style="s2">answer but there should be an actor</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.150" end="00:14:00.200" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to point out you how</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.470" end="00:14:01.460" style="s2">problematic consciousness is okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.200" end="00:14:02.810" style="s2">am take it that we&#39;re not going to</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:33.030" style="s2">is being lost in the searchlight</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:37.140" style="s2">metaphor prevention I believe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.030" end="00:17:39.030" style="s2">where we got to exactly right now I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.140" end="00:17:42.930" style="s2">should I talk about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.030" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">between things being independent in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.930" end="00:17:48.510" style="s2">theory but almost always functionally</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:51.480" style="s2">integrated together so blank stares</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.510" end="00:17:53.580" style="s2">which means output then okay so from</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.480" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">replaces that I&#39;m not this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.580" end="00:17:59.790" style="s2">Cartesian trap right the global</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:01.880" style="s2">processing of the salt the local</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.790" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">processing the features right</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.880" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">transparency reporting you in this way</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.490" end="00:18:31.190" style="s2">so although we can analyze these two</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.730" end="00:18:32.330" style="s2">things and it&#39;s not be erratic ly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.190" end="00:18:36.020" style="s2">identical together</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.330" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">it is that often the case that they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:41.750" style="s2">so occurring together in a functionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:43.850" style="s2">integrated question we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.750" end="00:18:46.670" style="s2">the possibility of this and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.850" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">possibility of this I&#39;ve got to trade on</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.670" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">these two because these seem to these</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:52.520" style="s2">these two things map on to some</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:53.570" style="s2">functions we&#39;re going to process and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.520" end="00:18:55.670" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about when we take a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.570" end="00:18:57.830" style="s2">look at it&#39;s a problem-solving and also</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.670" end="00:19:00.130" style="s2">two processes that are at work within</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.830" end="00:19:02.750" style="s2">different kinds of mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.130" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">so the idea what this is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.750" end="00:19:08.270" style="s2">represent is you&#39;re moving from vitro to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:10.190" style="s2">the salt and you&#39;re going or looking at</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.270" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">funding to looking through it this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.190" end="00:19:13.490" style="s2">you&#39;re going from yourself to patrol and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">you&#39;re going from looking through</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.490" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">something to stepping back from looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:31.720" style="s2">so what I want to now do is try argue</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.980" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">how this different model of attention is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.720" end="00:19:38.020" style="s2">a lot of theoretical machinery for</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:40.510" style="s2">organizing and bringing together blood</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.020" end="00:19:42.190" style="s2">results in the insight literature about</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.510" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in restructuring and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.190" end="00:19:50.650" style="s2">perhaps give us the basis for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:55.240" style="s2">theoretical integration and also this</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.650" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">way of looking at attention will help us</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.240" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">to connect to processes that are at work</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:03.640" style="s2">within mindfulness practices and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:06.180" style="s2">that of course will afford us how can</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.640" end="00:20:08.410" style="s2">you explain the increasing evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.180" end="00:20:11.110" style="s2">mindfulness practices enhance your</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.410" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">capacity for insight calm soul which of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.110" end="00:20:15.750" style="s2">course has been the traditional claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:18.910" style="s2">and then it is copies being</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.750" end="00:20:31.060" style="s2">substantiative by ongoing experimental</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.910" end="00:20:35.260" style="s2">confirmation ok ok so far all right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.060" end="00:20:37.150" style="s2">let&#39;s think about what let&#39;s just let us</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.260" end="00:20:40.170" style="s2">talk about this intuitively and then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.150" end="00:20:44.790" style="s2">want to start following it up with some</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.170" end="00:20:44.790" style="s2">research some of it done here at U of T</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.620" end="00:20:58.630" style="s2">ok so doing this would break up results</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.450" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">in your cognition it would break up like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.630" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:06.520" style="s2">that you have imposed on things because</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">you&#39;re moving from Gestalt to the future</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.520" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.730" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">stepping back and looking at your</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.910" end="00:21:24.810" style="s2">subsidiary processing would have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:24.810" style="s2">effect of the automating it to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.020" end="00:21:36.910" style="s2">one so automatic something is to right</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:41.880" style="s2">do the opposite it is to take things out</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.910" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">of working memory out of funk justice</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.880" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">right so that you can perform the option</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:51.720" style="s2">automatically that is without requiring</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">like directed manipulation within</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.720" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">awareness within working memory so</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">driving then you look everything right</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.750" end="00:22:48.160" style="s2">but after a while right</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:50.680" style="s2">that becomes procedure wise and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.160" end="00:22:53.800" style="s2">becomes automatic and you can have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.680" end="00:22:56.560" style="s2">really horrifying experience you can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.800" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">driving up in common highway and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.560" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">you realize I&#39;m paying attention for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:05.900" style="s2">last 15 minutes I get in my head on the</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.900" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">so this phenomena which is widely</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.010" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">reported and documented is known as</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.920" end="00:23:21.059" style="s2">zombie you can rely on your internal</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.059" end="00:23:28.290" style="s2">it has been automated but me the process</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:31.470" style="s2">has been really it&#39;s been organized so</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.290" end="00:23:34.590" style="s2">that it does not require write conscious</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.470" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">direction of working memory in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.590" end="00:23:51.000" style="s2">do the thing now the opposite is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:53.580" style="s2">case if you try to redirect attention to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.000" end="00:23:55.860" style="s2">processes that are normally subsidiary</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.580" end="00:23:58.679" style="s2">and happen automatically if you bring</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.860" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">them into consciousness then that often</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.679" end="00:24:04.230" style="s2">has the effect of disrupting their</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:06.420" style="s2">automaticity precisely because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.230" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">now giving working memory access to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.420" end="00:24:12.780" style="s2">so MIT so if you are typing and some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:14.520" style="s2">you are writing and this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.780" end="00:24:16.380" style="s2">suggesting was going on with concurrent</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.380" end="00:24:20.910" style="s2">se if I ask you to try and focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.840" end="00:24:23.309" style="s2">subsidiary processes in your fingers</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.910" end="00:24:24.570" style="s2">when you&#39;re typing pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.309" end="00:24:29.490" style="s2">your fingers are doing what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.570" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2">your ability to buddy slows down and if</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.170" end="00:24:40.050" style="s2">could do all of this without language</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.250" end="00:24:42.809" style="s2">being involved all interference isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.050" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">from language per se the interference is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.809" end="00:24:48.090" style="s2">right when you are doing a transparency</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:48.840" style="s2">of a positive shift that tends to D</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.090" end="00:24:51.530" style="s2">automatron</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.840" end="00:24:53.700" style="s2">some of your cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.530" end="00:24:55.490" style="s2">understand evolutionary reason why you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.700" end="00:24:59.670" style="s2">should be able to do this because</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.490" end="00:25:03.800" style="s2">sometimes you need to debug your autumn</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.670" end="00:25:03.800" style="s2">eyes on other parts processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.780" end="00:25:09.110" style="s2">so sometimes this will be the cabling</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:10.910" style="s2">physically example this happens a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.110" end="00:25:12.920" style="s2">martial arts you practice something a</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.910" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">lot and it becomes quite automatic and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.920" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">then somebody will show you over but</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:19.010" style="s2">here&#39;s a better way to do that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:21.020" style="s2">really hard to change it at first and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.010" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">you won&#39;t have to do you almost like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.020" end="00:25:25.820" style="s2">like like disruptive you have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.010" style="s2">pay attention do right break it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.820" end="00:25:30.440" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re speaking metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.010" end="00:25:32.510" style="s2">this is nothing physical visible no</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.440" end="00:25:34.340" style="s2">physical structure but you have to break</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.510" end="00:25:36.590" style="s2">up your processing you have to pay any</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.340" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">attention to what you&#39;re doing in order</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.590" end="00:25:41.420" style="s2">to make the move and then get the really</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.660" end="00:25:43.070" style="s2">interfere with it in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.420" end="00:25:43.850" style="s2">debug it you know we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.070" end="00:25:47.179" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.850" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">okay so what I put it out for you is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.179" end="00:25:52.340" style="s2">fact that you can get this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:55.010" style="s2">disruption and automatic processes just</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.340" end="00:25:57.610" style="s2">Y by doing a transparency or positive</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.500" end="00:26:09.810" style="s2">of course a clean example of where</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.480" end="00:26:12.340" style="s2">transparency opacity shifting is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.810" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">interfering or being interfered with by</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.340" end="00:26:18.010" style="s2">automatic processes a clear instance of</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.010" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">and automaticity are antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.710" end="00:26:24.400" style="s2">interfere with each other is the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:27.040" style="s2">studied effect in seismology which is</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.040" end="00:26:31.660" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to do a transparency</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.750" end="00:26:33.610" style="s2">to a property share and it&#39;s key is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.660" end="00:26:35.050" style="s2">right and that is interfering with and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.610" end="00:26:45.820" style="s2">you need to fuse with by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.050" end="00:26:48.750" style="s2">authenticity of your process again all</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.820" end="00:26:51.430" style="s2">of this is happening without language</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.750" end="00:26:53.500" style="s2">language can make it happen but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.430" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">nothing intrinsic about language making</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.500" end="00:27:02.850" style="s2">it happen we also have evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:09.700" style="s2">doing this kind of is going to salt to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.850" end="00:27:13.620" style="s2">petrol will break that processing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.700" end="00:27:15.850" style="s2">this comes from work using nawab letters</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.149" end="00:37:39.419" style="s2">four-month-old they can barely just see</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.269" end="00:37:42.089" style="s2">it give them these two figures to stare</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.419" end="00:37:43.409" style="s2">at freely and you can you can probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.089" end="00:37:51.059" style="s2">tell me which one will they look at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.409" end="00:37:56.009" style="s2">lot which one left now why because it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.059" end="00:37:58.979" style="s2">looks like a face no it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.849" end="00:40:42.940" style="s2">like safe lioness or something it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.349" end="00:40:46.630" style="s2">specifically related</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.630" end="00:40:51.880" style="s2">someone&#39;s as with oh all faces look very</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.260" end="00:40:53.530" style="s2">distinct I have difficulties recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.880" end="00:40:56.440" style="s2">people or someone else&#39;s oh I can very</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.530" end="00:40:59.140" style="s2">easily tell the people&#39;s like ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.440" end="00:41:01.330" style="s2">like oh I can put people in front office</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.140" end="00:41:03.250" style="s2">is not like a one person is just</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.330" end="00:41:04.869" style="s2">advantageous focusing too much on</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.250" end="00:41:06.790" style="s2">features and what overfitting and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.869" end="00:41:07.510" style="s2">other person is like general yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.790" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.510" end="00:41:11.349" style="s2">so people use very odd to continuing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:15.310" style="s2">way you said so it&#39;s probably something</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.349" end="00:41:18.910" style="s2">like that I don&#39;t know if it has</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.310" end="00:41:20.440" style="s2">anything any sort of you know attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.910" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">sort of study that population</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.440" end="00:41:25.300" style="s2">specifically in experimental fashion but</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:31.140" style="s2">I think that&#39;s possible yes but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.300" end="00:41:37.660" style="s2">should go now yes one more base thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.140" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">that is true so that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.660" end="00:41:41.380" style="s2">question about the degree to which but</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:43.570" style="s2">again they have to be careful remember</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.380" end="00:41:46.060" style="s2">my answer to Ainsley it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.570" end="00:41:49.030" style="s2">like one thing or the other right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.060" end="00:41:50.680" style="s2">the real flexibility between so if</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.030" end="00:41:52.450" style="s2">people are more sort of skewed and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.680" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">blocked probably they will have</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.450" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">detriment for instance or</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.470" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">between okay so there is no quick theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.700" end="00:42:14.940" style="s2">of handedness which is disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:19.350" style="s2">because is very couple point its</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.940" end="00:42:21.090" style="s2">efficiency in behind it so I mean does</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.350" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">shift around you&#39;re processing so much</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.090" end="00:42:25.020" style="s2">somewhat but it&#39;s no simple thing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:27.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re left-handed whether the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.020" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2">right-handed gonna meet your right hand</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.210" end="00:42:43.110" style="s2">stairs almond something like that okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.500" end="00:42:47.490" style="s2">let&#39;s go back okay so while the prey and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.110" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">Millis did was they have two groups of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.490" end="00:42:50.580" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:53.130" style="s2">- while others call these three groups</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.580" end="00:42:54.330" style="s2">one the control group and remember and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.130" end="00:42:57.720" style="s2">always tell the giving in the total</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.330" end="00:43:02.360" style="s2">group of what you&#39;re doing a boring okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.720" end="00:43:05.490" style="s2">so the first group right is going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.360" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">also in all groups all all three groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.490" end="00:43:19.860" style="s2">are going to look at faces all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:21.000" style="s2">this is worse for you okay and then what</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.860" end="00:43:24.830" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do is you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.000" end="00:43:24.830" style="s2">expose all three groups to Nawal mutters</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.340" end="00:43:38.150" style="s2">okay so here you guys drive people down</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.580" end="00:43:41.619" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to buy people up here</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.150" end="00:43:44.420" style="s2">you&#39;re actually just going to give usual</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.619" end="00:43:53.030" style="s2">that&#39;s like giving them to ruin a block</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.420" end="00:43:55.670" style="s2">letter so I did yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.030" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">what you now do is you now give people a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.670" end="00:44:03.590" style="s2">face recognition task you seen your face</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:05.840" style="s2">before now as you can expect the control</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.590" end="00:44:07.220" style="s2">group stays relatively constant because</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.840" end="00:44:09.980" style="s2">that&#39;s what you want if your control</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.220" end="00:44:12.170" style="s2">group is walking around then scrap your</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.980" end="00:44:14.840" style="s2">experiment friend okay so that happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.170" end="00:44:17.260" style="s2">so these people&#39;s face recognition</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.840" end="00:44:21.410" style="s2">declined considerably and these people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.260" end="00:44:24.230" style="s2">improved now what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.410" end="00:44:26.330" style="s2">this is you can kick you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.230" end="00:44:29.090" style="s2">with novel letters you can also do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.330" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">with language but notice you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.090" end="00:44:33.770" style="s2">with nav on letters you do it language</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:35.840" style="s2">and here&#39;s how you do with language I</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.770" end="00:44:40.820" style="s2">give you a bunch of these and I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.840" end="00:44:42.080" style="s2">to describe somebody&#39;s face if I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.820" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">to describe somebody&#39;s face that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.080" end="00:44:45.910" style="s2">actually impairs you being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:48.950" style="s2">recognize that face later which means</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.910" end="00:44:50.510" style="s2">think of a look at what this means you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.950" end="00:44:53.180" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be doing but the police</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.510" end="00:44:56.330" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be doing ask people to give</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:44:57.890" style="s2">description and then ask them to try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.330" end="00:45:00.760" style="s2">point somebody out enough in a retina</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.890" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">and a line because it actually appears</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.760" end="00:45:05.060" style="s2">but there&#39;s something that police could</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.350" style="s2">be doing to overcome that and this had</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.060" end="00:45:09.800" style="s2">to do with finger she did the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.350" end="00:45:14.230" style="s2">experiment right specifically with NAB</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.800" end="00:45:17.210" style="s2">on letters but in the intervening right</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.230" end="00:45:23.060" style="s2">she would give people music to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.210" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">or mazes to trace through again non</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">linguistic stimuli that drives people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:30.890" style="s2">the gestalt level and what she was able</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:32.750" style="s2">to do is completely remove the</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.750" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">the face or have you gone down to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.330" end="00:45:40.040" style="s2">feature level so what does it police</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:41.290" style="s2">should do is ask you to describe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.040" end="00:45:54.820" style="s2">face and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.290" end="00:45:56.080" style="s2">face over to you seriously yes so but</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.820" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">people generally don&#39;t like to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.080" end="00:46:00.100" style="s2">experience unplugging potahto</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">I know but as I find out laughing when</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.100" end="00:46:05.940" style="s2">you&#39;re impossible</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.220" end="00:46:15.610" style="s2">and so like is similar thing would</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.850" end="00:46:18.250" style="s2">happen after I didn&#39;t do what I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.610" end="00:46:21.340" style="s2">doing on my velocity baby plan my four</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.250" end="00:46:23.260" style="s2">degrees and you do a lot of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.340" end="00:46:27.360" style="s2">analysis and logic and then you go only</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.260" end="00:46:29.290" style="s2">people to try to talk to you all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.360" end="00:46:34.060" style="s2">and then they don&#39;t want to be around</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.290" end="00:46:36.310" style="s2">you you don&#39;t want to be around now okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.060" end="00:46:39.610" style="s2">so what I&#39;m showing you all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.310" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">that independent of language I can cause</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.610" end="00:46:44.110" style="s2">so what I was showing you intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:46.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve got experimental evidence for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.110" end="00:46:49.390" style="s2">interference effects by moving you up</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.210" end="00:46:55.090" style="s2">and down the straw feet row moving Union</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.390" end="00:46:58.390" style="s2">up okay so forget right and Dominique&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.150" end="00:47:15.910" style="s2">example and I so remember the income to</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:23.560" style="s2">outlet the letter L so you&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.150" end="00:47:25.180" style="s2">to the future level already gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.560" end="00:47:27.580" style="s2">class that Prime&#39;s you it requires you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.180" end="00:47:31.000" style="s2">to make use of an H right you up to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.580" end="00:47:32.500" style="s2">assault level you only have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.000" end="00:47:33.610" style="s2">relative to sometimes for studios</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.500" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">because as I mentioned repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.610" end="00:47:37.600" style="s2">assaulted each role or relative terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:38.060" style="s2">nothing is intrinsically a fish fault or</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.880" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">but the other point I was making is I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.610" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">can do this with language as well I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:52.560" style="s2">ask you to describe the features of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">somebody&#39;s face and that will cause like</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.560" end="00:47:58.200" style="s2">interference your ability to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:48:00.090" style="s2">it this so when I try to show you these</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.200" end="00:48:01.320" style="s2">language can do this but I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.090" end="00:48:03.810" style="s2">give you lots of evidence that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.320" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to do this and I can cause</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.810" end="00:48:09.780" style="s2">this to happen without using language so</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:12.120" style="s2">why am i doing this because I&#39;m showing</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.780" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">you how useless verbal overshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.120" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">constructed okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.500" end="00:48:31.220" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.260" end="00:48:44.380" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look at these moves</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.020" end="00:48:51.290" style="s2">within the inside literature itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.380" end="00:48:53.750" style="s2">potential moves then let&#39;s knock them</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.290" end="00:48:55.850" style="s2">into and whenever I show you and even</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.750" end="00:48:57.350" style="s2">have to bear with you as we start to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.850" end="00:48:59.300" style="s2">look at the inside literature it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.350" end="00:49:03.290" style="s2">to look like a very inconsistent set of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.300" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">data about the attentional relations</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.290" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">with anyone I hope to show you how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.050" end="00:49:37.250" style="s2">can actually well I mean remember young</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.590" style="s2">Wilmington diamond pointed out that</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.210" end="00:49:47.990" style="s2">shift from left to right it would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:50.600" style="s2">interesting if I would like it if people</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.990" end="00:49:52.010" style="s2">would do with sort of poetry readings or</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.600" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">poetry generation what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.010" end="00:49:58.130" style="s2">with jazz music so jazz music musicians</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">are not being extensively studied and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.130" end="00:50:01.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about this when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">the flow state in particular in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.160" end="00:50:05.780" style="s2">course because jazz is a powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:07.840" style="s2">inducing them closely it&#39;s second only</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.780" end="00:50:11.330" style="s2">to the most powerful flow induction</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.840" end="00:50:17.600" style="s2">activity we have which is what what do</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.330" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">you think it is no rock mining is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.600" end="00:50:21.050" style="s2">good and that&#39;s why people do it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:23.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the only reason why you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.050" end="00:50:25.010" style="s2">because otherwise it&#39;s something from</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.910" end="00:50:39.890" style="s2">inducing the flow state so think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.220" end="00:50:42.770" style="s2">why come after that later okay so I wish</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.890" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">that people would do with poetry there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:47.450" style="s2">been some studies about hope or less</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:49.310" style="s2">connections between poetry and flow but</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:51.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if anybody&#39;s done some of</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.290" end="00:51:01.730" style="s2">they did we would find interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.730" end="00:51:03.670" style="s2">result very similar kinds of results if</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.730" end="00:51:07.190" style="s2">you have phenomenological equivalences</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.670" end="00:51:12.340" style="s2">people getting into the flow state doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.190" end="00:51:12.340" style="s2">gorgeous that&#39;s the best bet here son</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.750" end="00:51:28.010" style="s2">okay mmm so what do we want to do is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.510" end="00:51:30.020" style="s2">lot of people have been making use of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.010" end="00:51:32.600" style="s2">the individual differences methodology</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.020" end="00:51:34.790" style="s2">that was originally undertaken remember</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.600" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">by shoulder Mel trip and that also get</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.790" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">by googly-moogly working trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">the the processes it seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:47.840" style="s2">participative insight now let&#39;s remember</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:52.660" style="s2">we know some already we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.840" end="00:51:55.310" style="s2">them remember the cognitive leap in and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.660" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">there was the perceptual restructure or</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.310" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">at least the attentional restructure</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:04.310" style="s2">that that course is saying it needs work</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:08.359" style="s2">so some of the first work around and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.310" end="00:52:10.790" style="s2">then like on this aspect of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.359" end="00:52:14.180" style="s2">get clear about what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.790" end="00:52:16.840" style="s2">restructuring the work of knowledge and</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.700" end="00:52:30.119" style="s2">so and the original important</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.060" end="00:52:31.849" style="s2">experiments are 99 in replication since</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.119" end="00:52:36.599" style="s2">and he&#39;s done something more recently</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.849" end="00:52:38.220" style="s2">and what knobbly did the original work</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.599" end="00:52:39.540" style="s2">was not not looking Olsen by the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.220" end="00:52:42.420" style="s2">some of you know also because you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.540" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">look at some of his work in your</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:50.970" style="s2">see the top is also the same Olsen</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.670" end="00:52:53.910" style="s2">right is taking a look at a process is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.970" end="00:52:58.890" style="s2">that seem to be predictive of concluding</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.910" end="00:53:00.839" style="s2">insight and the first that the first</p>

<p begin="00:54:09.569" end="00:54:12.750" style="s2">better way of figuring about what</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.550" style="s2">working memory is doing that is it sort</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:27.069" style="s2">and that&#39;s all really a chunk is right</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:33.319" style="s2">another way of putting it using our</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.249" end="00:54:36.349" style="s2">language a chop is basically something</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.319" end="00:54:37.940" style="s2">that you process as a result because the</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:07.369" style="s2">seconds okay so what not book found is</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.760" end="00:55:10.970" style="s2">the better if people are at tum</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.900" end="00:55:46.460" style="s2">non-controversial them okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.599" end="00:55:47.869" style="s2">battlefield is a loose chunk because</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.460" end="00:55:49.190" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for you to break it up into</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.869" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2">two other chunks that are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.190" end="00:55:58.339" style="s2">only one field okay cap right it is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:56:00.920" style="s2">much tighter chunk because if you break</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.339" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">it up you lose semantically you still</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.920" end="00:56:05.180" style="s2">have graphic meaning you still know to</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:08.920" style="s2">see years and years</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.180" end="00:56:13.630" style="s2">right but you&#39;ll lose semantics near</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.920" end="00:56:18.080" style="s2">look what the top cut it&#39;s not number</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.630" end="00:56:20.690" style="s2">okay in the brain right and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.080" end="00:56:22.220" style="s2">think part of this needs to ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.690" end="00:56:24.380" style="s2">be integrated with things like Christmas</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.839" end="00:56:38.750" style="s2">are better at breaking up chunks right</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.140" end="00:56:40.339" style="s2">guys quite good quite well predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.750" end="00:56:45.740" style="s2">how good you are at solving inside</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.339" end="00:56:47.300" style="s2">problems which right since we need that</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.300" end="00:56:50.410" style="s2">facilitate inside</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.220" end="00:57:01.970" style="s2">now in fact there&#39;s even sort of soup</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.200" end="00:57:04.850" style="s2">represented not by giving it some</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.970" end="00:57:06.830" style="s2">perfectly formalized but the idea that</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.830" end="00:57:13.370" style="s2">harder it is to decompose it and he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.370" end="00:57:17.840" style="s2">stuff with Chinese ideograms so some</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.980" end="00:57:19.570" style="s2">classical cultural aspect there which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.840" end="00:57:21.530" style="s2">good by the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.570" end="00:57:23.300" style="s2">that needs to be done more other than</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.530" end="00:57:35.930" style="s2">what we called constraint without</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.300" end="00:57:38.840" style="s2">patience and he&#39;s not what is clear</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.930" end="00:57:41.480" style="s2">about what that means and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.840" end="00:57:44.360" style="s2">problem he uses an analogy uses a</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.480" end="00:57:46.040" style="s2">linguistic analogy he talks about like</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.360" end="00:57:48.560" style="s2">in is that like when you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.040" end="00:57:51.470" style="s2">Chomsky tree for example the sentence is</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.560" end="00:57:54.140" style="s2">the noun phrase or phrase this is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.470" end="00:58:00.530" style="s2">determiner and now rather this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.140" end="00:58:02.060" style="s2">perhaps an adverb phrase right a verb</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.530" end="00:58:04.550" style="s2">and then this breaks down into a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.060" end="00:58:06.440" style="s2">modifier etc how do you thusly talks</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.550" end="00:58:09.890" style="s2">nobody&#39;s home and you when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.440" end="00:58:12.770" style="s2">it you dream these trees at night very</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.890" end="00:58:15.800" style="s2">boring and the idea is that the higher</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.770" end="00:58:17.810" style="s2">up of constraint is but the more scope</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.800" end="00:58:19.850" style="s2">is the harder it is to relax the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.810" end="00:58:21.440" style="s2">constraint so that you thought I might</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.850" end="00:58:24.320" style="s2">need that constraints were organized in</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.440" end="00:58:26.360" style="s2">a hierarchical fashion where you talked</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.320" end="00:58:28.760" style="s2">about individual constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.360" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">particular problems so for example in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.760" end="00:58:35.930" style="s2">matchstick problem breaking up a number</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:37.460" style="s2">is easier than breaking then move in one</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.930" end="00:58:38.840" style="s2">of the moving of matchsticks that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.460" end="00:58:42.230" style="s2">being used as an operator like as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.840" end="00:58:44.420" style="s2">minus sign because that&#39;s a functional</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.230" end="00:58:47.890" style="s2">marker and so changing that is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.420" end="00:58:47.890" style="s2">to be harder to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.380" end="00:58:55.859" style="s2">I think this is this part of the work</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.259" end="00:58:57.329" style="s2">he&#39;s onto something but this things done</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.859" end="00:58:59.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s very murky and I want to try to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.329" end="00:59:01.499" style="s2">suggest you so this is not him this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.519" end="00:59:04.200" style="s2">not a real Ricky attempt to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.499" end="00:59:05.609" style="s2">constructive the problem about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.200" end="00:59:08.099" style="s2">get this is I&#39;ve really good evidence</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.609" end="00:59:13.979" style="s2">that instead is largely procedural in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.099" end="00:59:16.650" style="s2">nature right and so constraints probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.979" end="00:59:25.470" style="s2">aren&#39;t things like unconscious rules or</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.650" end="00:59:26.970" style="s2">propositions what we would need is what</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.470" end="00:59:28.680" style="s2">would a procedural version of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.970" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">constraint be well I&#39;m already giving</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.680" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">you sort of a good argument as what it</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.470" end="00:59:38.180" style="s2">is the more audible eyes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.180" style="s2">processing is the more constrained it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.309" end="00:59:48.749" style="s2">that being the case we could then soon</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.279" end="00:59:51.210" style="s2">as we do that notice that we could then</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.749" end="00:59:52.979" style="s2">come up with a sort of a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.210" end="00:59:56.729" style="s2">operationalizing and measuring this you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.979" end="00:59:59.130" style="s2">know the longer something is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.729" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">armitage the world advertised it is you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.130" end="01:00:03.299" style="s2">could measure that in terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">advertised something is by how easily it</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.299" end="01:00:08.910" style="s2">makes demands on your working memory</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.799" end="01:00:10.890" style="s2">look right that&#39;s the more obvious I</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.910" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">something is the less eclipse demands</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.890" end="01:00:17.489" style="s2">our working memory so I could determine</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">how automatically something is by right</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.489" end="01:00:24.210" style="s2">testing you can continue to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:25.619" style="s2">process a cat without interference as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.210" end="01:00:27.299" style="s2">put more cognitive load on your working</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.619" end="01:00:29.729" style="s2">memory so for example I&#39;m putting lots</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.299" end="01:00:31.979" style="s2">of cognitive working lots of diamonds</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.729" end="01:00:33.960" style="s2">load on your working memory by my</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.979" end="01:00:37.710" style="s2">lecturing what many of you are able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.960" end="01:00:42.119" style="s2">still write which is good evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.710" end="01:00:44.849" style="s2">is highly advertised which is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.119" end="01:00:49.109" style="s2">so hard for you to break that constraint</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.849" end="01:00:51.329" style="s2">in the strip effect you understand this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.109" end="01:00:53.039" style="s2">is not anything Norfolk does this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.329" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">something I&#39;m doing to try and make this</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.039" end="01:00:57.799" style="s2">more testable and measurable and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:57.799" style="s2">rigorous</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:03.630" style="s2">so what I&#39;m giving you is a plausibility</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.290" end="01:01:09.450" style="s2">argument as to what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.630" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">constraint relaxation I&#39;m going to give</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.450" end="01:01:13.820" style="s2">you some evidence for this in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:16.140" style="s2">the way mindfulness facilitates inside</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.820" end="01:01:17.970" style="s2">so what I&#39;m suggesting to you is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.140" end="01:01:32.520" style="s2">this is basically you should be</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.970" end="01:01:35.190" style="s2">understood as the authorization now if</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.520" end="01:01:38.310" style="s2">we do it that way then one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.190" end="01:01:40.440" style="s2">benefits of that is we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.310" end="01:01:41.940" style="s2">the intentional we can now talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.440" end="01:01:46.500" style="s2">both of these in terms of potential</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.940" end="01:01:49.350" style="s2">mechanisms short decomposition is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.500" end="01:01:52.890" style="s2">move this way intentionally to go from</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.350" end="01:01:57.150" style="s2">the salt to featural the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.890" end="01:02:01.040" style="s2">foundation is to go this way is to do a</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.150" end="01:02:01.040" style="s2">transparency to little faculty shoes</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.109" end="01:02:13.859" style="s2">so whatnot let&#39;s work is really showing</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.329" end="01:02:18.499" style="s2">is that you doing both you&#39;ll tend to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.859" end="01:02:18.499" style="s2">get right and improvement in either side</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">and one trying to show you other work</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.180" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">that lines up with that</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:36.710" style="s2">okay so far so I&#39;m not going to rely</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:39.910" style="s2">just on those I&#39;m going to come back</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.710" end="01:02:42.710" style="s2">we&#39;ll take a look at we&#39;re done here</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.910" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happening others about</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.710" end="01:02:47.810" style="s2">this idea of an integration of these two</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.400" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">the attentional processes a way of</p>

<p begin="01:05:04.450" end="01:05:09.130" style="s2">to go over the whole experiment some of</p>

<p begin="01:05:09.130" end="01:05:15.400" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to concentrate on one</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:18.010" style="s2">important part they wanted to examine</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.400" end="01:05:25.329" style="s2">the degree to which what they call</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.010" end="01:05:27.510" style="s2">breaking frame and block that term for</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.660" end="01:05:40.990" style="s2">they operationalize breaking frame is</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.870" end="01:05:44.850" style="s2">they did it in terms of using what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.990" end="01:05:44.850" style="s2">called the anomalous card sorting task</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.000" end="01:05:49.000" style="s2">so in the anomalous card storage ask</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.350" end="01:05:52.540" style="s2">what happened is I give you a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.000" end="01:05:53.710" style="s2">playing cards actually pictures of</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.190" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">then you can&#39;t have awareness of it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:05.260" style="s2">you have to identify the cards that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:08.280" style="s2">anomalous an anomalous card would be</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.260" end="01:06:13.900" style="s2">something like a block three of parts a</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.280" end="01:06:17.500" style="s2">black Lea parts now this task turns out</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.900" end="01:06:19.930" style="s2">to be independently important so this</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.500" end="01:06:21.610" style="s2">ability to detect anomalies is also</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.930" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">predictive well this is what from</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.610" end="01:06:26.470" style="s2">George&#39;s other works shows right</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:29.350" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to detect anomalies or</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.470" end="01:06:31.210" style="s2">not detect anomalies seems to be quite</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.350" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">predictive of how prone they are to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.210" end="01:06:37.630" style="s2">self-deception which I mean I can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:39.070" style="s2">into it right now because this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.630" end="01:06:40.810" style="s2">course on abnormal psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.070" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">everything but it kind of makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.810" end="01:06:46.360" style="s2">right one of the things in which we one</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:49.420" style="s2">of the ways in which we can deceive</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.360" end="01:06:51.190" style="s2">ourselves is by like not paying</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.420" end="01:06:57.640" style="s2">attention to things that don&#39;t fit our</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.190" end="01:06:59.950" style="s2">current structure it also points out</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.640" end="01:07:01.210" style="s2">right interesting connection we need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.950" end="01:07:02.740" style="s2">go the other way and I can&#39;t explore</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.210" end="01:07:05.500" style="s2">very much here I do in another course</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.740" end="01:07:07.900" style="s2">that of course one way of seeing insight</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.500" end="01:07:10.180" style="s2">is that insight is adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.900" end="01:07:12.820" style="s2">revolutionary machine for overcoming</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.180" end="01:07:15.030" style="s2">self assumption one of the functions of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.820" end="01:07:17.780" style="s2">insight is to free us from the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.030" end="01:07:23.490" style="s2">which we are is framing situation in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.780" end="01:07:27.530" style="s2">self-destructive manner now being said</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.490" end="01:07:29.940" style="s2">no and what they found was in fact that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.530" end="01:07:31.760" style="s2">they did some work on converging the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.940" end="01:07:33.810" style="s2">divergent thinking I won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:37.050" style="s2">largely because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.810" end="01:07:43.350" style="s2">controversy over whether or not those</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.050" end="01:07:45.180" style="s2">are consistent constructs well and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.350" end="01:07:46.680" style="s2">point important for when the experiment</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.180" end="01:07:51.050" style="s2">is that this was independent of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.680" end="01:07:53.610" style="s2">factors independently predicted</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.050" end="01:07:55.890" style="s2">independently predicted how well you</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.610" end="01:07:57.420" style="s2">look solve inside problems now notice</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.890" end="01:07:59.250" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in the anomalous card</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.420" end="01:08:01.500" style="s2">sorting tells notice the two things you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.250" end="01:08:03.420" style="s2">have to do you have to break up the</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.500" end="01:08:09.090" style="s2">default of the car to notice three</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.420" end="01:08:10.800" style="s2">distinctive feature and you also have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.090" end="01:08:18.150" style="s2">do something else you have to be on with</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.800" end="01:08:19.529" style="s2">eyes your card recognition processes you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.150" end="01:08:22.109" style="s2">have to do transparency to app actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.529" end="01:08:26.490" style="s2">shifted you have to become aware of how</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.109" end="01:08:28.230" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention to the cars now</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.490" end="01:08:31.410" style="s2">we sort of feel aspects of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.230" end="01:08:32.819" style="s2">that work there so what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.410" end="01:08:35.819" style="s2">show you is that breaking frame is</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.819" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">exactly again this kind of milk going</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.819" end="01:08:41.549" style="s2">downwards right breaking up the resulted</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:43.350" style="s2">with features and doing the transparency</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.549" end="01:08:47.420" style="s2">opacity ship in order to the anima pars</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.350" end="01:08:47.420" style="s2">the friending of the situation</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.720" end="01:08:57.640" style="s2">so similar work hand on independently</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.410" end="01:09:13.110" style="s2">this time ended completely undependable</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.640" end="01:09:13.110" style="s2">for me is work by McCaffrey sorry 2012</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:19.780" style="s2">as far as I could tell McCaffrey is</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.300" end="01:09:22.210" style="s2">unaware of the work-life failures and</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.780" end="01:09:25.390" style="s2">plant of the unclenox and Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.210" end="01:09:27.460" style="s2">I think he&#39;s aware of some above the</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.390" end="01:09:30.400" style="s2">knot with work that it&#39;s not that clear</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.460" end="01:09:32.710" style="s2">any lace what he did was he was giving</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.400" end="01:09:34.780" style="s2">people a particular problem to solve and</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.710" end="01:09:38.380" style="s2">he was looking for basically inside</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.780" end="01:09:41.980" style="s2">problem solving the innovative problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.380" end="01:09:44.890" style="s2">solving it&#39;s exactly the same thing look</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.980" end="01:09:47.380" style="s2">at the work so what he was giving people</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.890" end="01:09:50.920" style="s2">was the following problem I give you a</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.380" end="01:09:53.980" style="s2">one-inch metal cube right I give you a</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.920" end="01:09:55.510" style="s2">candle I give you two metal rings right</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.980" end="01:09:58.630" style="s2">here&#39;s my candles in my one each pedal</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.510" end="01:10:00.730" style="s2">to run a mill cube here is my two metal</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.630" end="01:10:03.220" style="s2">rings and using only these things you</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.730" end="01:10:04.900" style="s2">have to attach the two metal rings</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.220" end="01:10:06.790" style="s2">together so you can&#39;t pull them apart</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.900" end="01:10:09.130" style="s2">and I&#39;ll tell you write an app right now</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.790" end="01:10:16.420" style="s2">if the Rays are stainless steel and wax</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.130" end="01:10:17.950" style="s2">won&#39;t stick to them some people say well</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.420" end="01:10:20.200" style="s2">you know I like the county when I try to</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.950" end="01:10:27.310" style="s2">melt the two rings into each other many</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.200" end="01:10:28.630" style="s2">of you know this cap off okay so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.310" end="01:10:29.950" style="s2">doing this backwards and of course I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:11:22.370" end="01:11:27.050" style="s2">try to step back and look at the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.350" end="01:11:29.270" style="s2">and reduce it so they do the significant</p>

<p begin="01:11:42.969" end="01:11:48.670" style="s2">think about okay well I break this thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.820" end="01:11:51.280" style="s2">off into its parts and this isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.670" end="01:11:53.380" style="s2">wax it&#39;s this sort of you know semi</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.280" end="01:11:56.070" style="s2">solid substance or even manipulate and</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.380" end="01:11:59.679" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a wick it&#39;s a long string and</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.070" end="01:12:01.420" style="s2">now do you have an answer you can of</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.679" end="01:12:04.530" style="s2">course take the wick which is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.420" end="01:12:08.260" style="s2">string and tie the two rings together</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.530" end="01:12:11.770" style="s2">now interestingly if you took people</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.260" end="01:12:14.860" style="s2">right and you gave them this training</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.770" end="01:12:18.070" style="s2">program and gave them problems like this</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.860" end="01:12:20.800" style="s2">he was able to get I believe it was a 67</p>

<p begin="01:12:20.800" end="01:12:43.239" style="s2">being able to solve these yes and that</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.369" end="01:12:48.280" style="s2">is hot enough you can just also ring</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.239" end="01:12:51.820" style="s2">inside sort of words with with sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.280" end="01:12:54.250" style="s2">we&#39;d be wise know you is attached to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.820" end="01:12:56.079" style="s2">wick so you can do it without this was</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.250" end="01:12:58.449" style="s2">very separate and it looks a nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.079" end="01:13:04.000" style="s2">physics you can also do that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.449" end="01:13:07.900" style="s2">know if anybody did that it only works</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.000" end="01:13:10.030" style="s2">because the wire independent children</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.900" end="01:13:13.179" style="s2">with but it also depends also not</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.030" end="01:13:16.659" style="s2">breaking up its the component keeping</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.179" end="01:13:22.570" style="s2">felt like a twig in wax is wax and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.659" end="01:13:24.190" style="s2">wick wick I guess I don&#39;t understand one</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.570" end="01:13:25.869" style="s2">for some of the other problems but I</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.190" end="01:13:28.270" style="s2">don&#39;t know they didn&#39;t report anybody</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.869" end="01:13:31.320" style="s2">giving that so it but again most people</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.270" end="01:13:31.320" style="s2">don&#39;t report all the raw data</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.050" end="01:13:44.730" style="s2">okay no but you can find it on far</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.690" end="01:13:47.790" style="s2">everyone to is a possibility but we</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.730" end="01:13:52.140" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.790" end="01:13:53.970" style="s2">because cabling can write the wax itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.140" end="01:13:57.200" style="s2">when pull these together you can&#39;t melt</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.970" end="01:13:59.880" style="s2">them together with the point Mary yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.200" end="01:14:05.010" style="s2">how do people come up with like new</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.880" end="01:14:06.960" style="s2">insight problems so you basically do the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.010" end="01:14:09.510" style="s2">reverse lock I&#39;ve actually talked about</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.960" end="01:14:11.490" style="s2">this a long time ago and we have a</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.510" end="01:14:12.450" style="s2">cultural practice for coming up with new</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.490" end="01:14:22.470" style="s2">insight problems</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.450" end="01:14:24.630" style="s2">it&#39;s called generating a riddle so do</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.470" end="01:14:33.810" style="s2">you think that all occupations are the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.630" end="01:14:35.070" style="s2">generations of little so in that sense I</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.810" end="01:14:37.050" style="s2">think there&#39;s something you&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.070" end="01:14:39.440" style="s2">to getting is deeper one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.050" end="01:14:42.180" style="s2">I&#39;m going to consider is whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.440" end="01:14:45.180" style="s2">insight and creativity and substance are</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.180" end="01:14:47.730" style="s2">using the same machinery but insight is</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.180" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">using the machinery in Reverse as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.730" end="01:14:53.940" style="s2">proposing so a lot of people explore the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:57.030" style="s2">possibility that insight is about</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.940" end="01:15:01.230" style="s2">solving problems whereas creativity&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.030" end="01:15:02.760" style="s2">finding problems we&#39;ll take a look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.230" end="01:15:06.840" style="s2">that proposal there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.760" end="01:15:10.710" style="s2">narrative a proposal it might be the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.840" end="01:15:12.330" style="s2">creativity is about finding problems and</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.710" end="01:15:13.980" style="s2">then formulating them so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.330" end="01:15:16.380" style="s2">intelligible or potentially solvable</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.980" end="01:15:20.120" style="s2">rather than just generating riddles for</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.380" end="01:15:22.340" style="s2">people but what you just did is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.120" end="01:15:25.580" style="s2">bonafide attempt you</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.340" end="01:15:27.949" style="s2">how the machinery of insight and</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.580" end="01:15:29.389" style="s2">creativity overlap so much what</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.949" end="01:15:32.179" style="s2">creativity could be something different</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.389" end="01:15:38.810" style="s2">from inside okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.179" end="01:15:51.199" style="s2">well but yes in one sense sorry - all</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.810" end="01:15:53.690" style="s2">right answer or yes on the durability to</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.199" end="01:15:55.550" style="s2">solve inside problems positively</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.690" end="01:15:57.920" style="s2">correlated with likes and instability</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.550" end="01:16:00.710" style="s2">well the problem with answering that</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.920" end="01:16:02.060" style="s2">question is exactly that the theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.710" end="01:16:03.260" style="s2">issue that was brought up in my</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.060" end="01:16:05.960" style="s2">discussion with Jim again and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.260" end="01:16:07.730" style="s2">foreshadowed if for example if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.960" end="01:16:08.989" style="s2">no if there&#39;s no deep theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.730" end="01:16:10.639" style="s2">difference between insight and</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.989" end="01:16:12.590" style="s2">creativity we would find a high</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.639" end="01:16:14.599" style="s2">correlation between insight creativity</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.590" end="01:16:16.550" style="s2">but that wouldn&#39;t be meaningful because</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.599" end="01:16:19.010" style="s2">all we&#39;ve done we would find the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.550" end="01:16:21.560" style="s2">but I like I like the way you talked</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.010" end="01:16:24.139" style="s2">about it before us like insight is some</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.560" end="01:16:26.030" style="s2">problem and it really creates leads</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.139" end="01:16:28.280" style="s2">generating problem finding profiling</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.030" end="01:16:30.800" style="s2">comes right where it&#39;s all about solving</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.280" end="01:16:32.270" style="s2">found problems so when that like since</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.800" end="01:16:33.409" style="s2">they used someone with sharing one day</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.270" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">that they should be highly correlated</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.409" end="01:16:37.940" style="s2">with each other right and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.840" end="01:16:40.369" style="s2">suggesting to you is we what we have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.940" end="01:16:41.989" style="s2">do is get clear on we have to get a</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.369" end="01:16:44.090" style="s2">clear consensus on the construct of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.989" end="01:16:45.469" style="s2">creativity in order to do the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.090" end="01:16:47.510" style="s2">correlational study you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.469" end="01:16:49.699" style="s2">part of what I&#39;m suggesting to you is we</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.510" end="01:16:51.849" style="s2">don&#39;t have that yet I mean we even have</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.849" end="01:16:58.219" style="s2">argues that there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.659" end="01:17:00.830" style="s2">creativity well that&#39;s sort of his stick</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.219" end="01:17:04.119" style="s2">right imagine living with them going</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.830" end="01:17:04.119" style="s2">into learning room there&#39;s no such thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.940" end="01:17:12.670" style="s2">okay well I never measure PC I have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.490" end="01:17:14.770" style="s2">lot of sled for him I mean for the</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.530" end="01:17:26.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a lot of convergence for this</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.880" end="01:17:28.660" style="s2">idea of breaking frame and if</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.680" end="01:18:24.000" style="s2">right and this will mine up again with</p>

<p begin="01:18:24.949" end="01:18:30.800" style="s2">so you get so we were considering ideas</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.949" end="01:18:34.160" style="s2">that you know insight is very procedural</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.800" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s about you know coming up</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.160" end="01:18:38.810" style="s2">with a structural functional</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.330" end="01:19:13.010" style="s2">on you just add them and repeatedly from</p>

<p begin="01:19:20.810" end="01:19:26.960" style="s2">you do is you have people that you then</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.140" end="01:19:29.420" style="s2">surprise them you have you know judges</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.960" end="01:19:30.800" style="s2">come in who could potentially move them</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.420" end="01:19:32.239" style="s2">to a better league or something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.800" end="01:19:35.260" style="s2">that this is all kind of deception</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.239" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s an experiment and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.260" end="01:19:39.890" style="s2">people are being watched and what would</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:41.770" style="s2">you predict happen when they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.890" end="01:19:45.080" style="s2">watched what happens to their average</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.770" end="01:19:47.690" style="s2">puts out okay because they start doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.080" end="01:19:50.060" style="s2">this they start breaking up the gestalt</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.690" end="01:19:52.070" style="s2">and they start thinking they start</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.060" end="01:19:54.140" style="s2">becoming as a self-conscious they start</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.070" end="01:19:58.340" style="s2">paying attention to how they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.140" end="01:19:59.630" style="s2">they de anima ties and that screws up</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.340" end="01:20:01.880" style="s2">their performance that performance</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.630" end="01:20:03.199" style="s2">degrades considerably which lines up</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.880" end="01:20:05.390" style="s2">with also what we saw with the face</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.199" end="01:20:09.949" style="s2">recognition etc then you get something</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.390" end="01:20:12.020" style="s2">really interesting right for this one</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.949" end="01:20:14.750" style="s2">and this was back to the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.020" end="01:20:19.920" style="s2">has become scarce a while ago everybody</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.750" end="01:20:22.320" style="s2">has to be right handed okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.920" end="01:20:24.000" style="s2">because you redo the experiment and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.320" end="01:20:27.780" style="s2">have one group just replicating that</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.000" end="01:20:29.880" style="s2">right get the average baseline and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.780" end="01:20:31.890" style="s2">it&#39;s getting them to shoot under you</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.880" end="01:20:34.320" style="s2">know critical observation the other</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.890" end="01:20:36.270" style="s2">would be the same thing baseline under</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.320" end="01:20:37.980" style="s2">critical observation but while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.270" end="01:20:40.890" style="s2">shooting on empirical observation</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.980" end="01:20:44.340" style="s2">they&#39;re squeezing a foam ball in their</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.890" end="01:20:46.470" style="s2">left hand which is an extra task which</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.340" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">should degrade the performance in terms</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.470" end="01:20:50.220" style="s2">of this cognitive load but what you find</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.960" end="01:20:52.950" style="s2">is if they&#39;re sleeping the ball on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.220" end="01:21:14.600" style="s2">left hand the performance doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.950" end="01:21:18.540" style="s2">degrade why not not so much because they</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.600" end="01:21:20.160" style="s2">do seem to be any seems to be if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.540" end="01:21:23.430" style="s2">sleeping in their left hand rather than</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.160" end="01:21:26.760" style="s2">in the right hand to try to that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.430" end="01:21:32.790" style="s2">reasonable yes one on the test process</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.760" end="01:21:35.670" style="s2">was another process which is what she</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.790" end="01:21:40.110" style="s2">said then what sounds like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.670" end="01:21:43.410" style="s2">she said so okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.110" end="01:21:49.740" style="s2">why squeezing your left hand</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.410" end="01:21:51.480" style="s2">what&#39;s up doing what part shifting</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.740" end="01:21:53.930" style="s2">activation suddenly to the right</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.480" end="01:21:57.810" style="s2">especially this part of the hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.930" end="01:22:01.350" style="s2">which is the area that was activity was</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.810" end="01:22:03.900" style="s2">shifted to an inside so notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.350" end="01:22:07.620" style="s2">going on here we get the pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.900" end="01:22:10.680" style="s2">activity shifting that was insightful</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.620" end="01:22:13.610" style="s2">generating is actually counter active to</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.680" end="01:22:13.610" style="s2">this breaking frame</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.610" end="01:22:19.620" style="s2">cranking cream is going to be right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.700" end="01:22:23.340" style="s2">actually detrimental to the performance</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.620" end="01:22:25.620" style="s2">and the cure to it is the shift activity</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.340" end="01:22:45.680" style="s2">like an input now it looks like this</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.620" end="01:22:48.150" style="s2">move is opposite to insight yes okay so</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.680" end="01:22:49.710" style="s2">they use the language of prominently you</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.150" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">can experience the probably difference</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.710" end="01:22:54.210" style="s2">that can choke and choking can be</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:56.040" style="s2">actually had the medical and here for it</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.210" end="01:22:58.590" style="s2">is to do is to have something like an</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.040" end="01:23:00.210" style="s2">infant experience so like what this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.590" end="01:23:02.310" style="s2">we just thought of as evidence that this</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.210" end="01:23:07.020" style="s2">facilitates insight and now it&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.310" end="01:23:10.410" style="s2">you the opposite and after they get more</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.020" end="01:23:20.820" style="s2">confusing there&#39;s evidence that going</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.410" end="01:23:27.740" style="s2">this way facilitate them say yes and all</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.820" end="01:23:27.740" style="s2">that they&#39;re not acting measuring</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.360" end="01:23:36.510" style="s2">actually but we do say that the shifting</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.180" end="01:23:38.730" style="s2">in activity is it what with rescues are</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.510" end="01:23:40.710" style="s2">from the impairment if the ship activity</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.730" end="01:23:47.760" style="s2">in a way is very analogous to the ship</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.710" end="01:23:49.190" style="s2">entities that we see in Yemen as saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.760" end="01:23:53.190" style="s2">exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.190" end="01:23:58.800" style="s2">oh this little comparison is they like</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.190" end="01:24:01.890" style="s2">dysentery with insight rescue this</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.800" end="01:24:04.420" style="s2">activity disgusting</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.890" end="01:24:06.940" style="s2">but what it&#39;s showing is their fines</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.420" end="01:24:10.540" style="s2">when right this breaking frame can</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.940" end="01:24:12.190" style="s2">actually mess up the shifting to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.540" end="01:24:23.130" style="s2">right that you need in order to succeed</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.190" end="01:24:25.300" style="s2">in the tax records head in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.130" end="01:24:29.590" style="s2">problems not being knocked on the genius</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.300" end="01:24:32.170" style="s2">class it could and but some customers</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.590" end="01:24:33.970" style="s2">that that might not be the case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.170" end="01:24:35.500" style="s2">going to propose you another thing but</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.970" end="01:24:37.540" style="s2">don&#39;t give up on that that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.500" end="01:24:39.340" style="s2">and many of you are still pursuing a</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.540" end="01:24:41.230" style="s2">critical line above this and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.340" end="01:24:42.700" style="s2">and you notice I will working for good</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.230" end="01:24:45.580" style="s2">result if you mark so that happen to</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.700" end="01:24:47.950" style="s2">mark none of your stop it&#39;s very I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.580" end="01:24:49.420" style="s2">I&#39;m making an argument and I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.950" end="01:24:50.860" style="s2">trying to make something plausible</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.420" end="01:24:52.780" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.860" end="01:24:55.540" style="s2">education should be persuasion</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.780" end="01:24:57.670" style="s2">weapon but also in importantly I want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.540" end="01:25:00.460" style="s2">see and I&#39;m training reporting skills in</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.670" end="01:25:02.560" style="s2">all of you yes um I guess my question is</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.460" end="01:25:04.180" style="s2">like more in line with this questions I</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.560" end="01:25:07.560" style="s2">guess it didn&#39;t completely understand</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.180" end="01:25:10.300" style="s2">I&#39;m like I guess yelling both of those</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.560" end="01:25:13.680" style="s2">both in sight and kicking a soccer ball</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.300" end="01:25:15.850" style="s2">like they&#39;re both they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.680" end="01:25:18.070" style="s2">procedural but it&#39;s like different</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.850" end="01:25:19.690" style="s2">procedures like maybe like maybe like</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.070" end="01:25:22.300" style="s2">one procedures for like autumn eyes</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.690" end="01:25:24.730" style="s2">activity the other activities of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.300" end="01:25:26.800" style="s2">other sort of procedures for inside</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.730" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">problems which requires the Ottoman size</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.800" end="01:25:30.820" style="s2">engine so it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.320" end="01:25:34.090" style="s2">fundamentally different and well let me</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.820" end="01:25:35.800" style="s2">try it this way I mean what you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.090" end="01:25:37.180" style="s2">trying to do is do something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.800" end="01:25:39.070" style="s2">already rejected you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.180" end="01:25:41.080" style="s2">back to the single difficulty hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.070" end="01:25:43.330" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get back to all I have</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.080" end="01:25:46.030" style="s2">to do is break the frame and that will</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.330" end="01:25:47.590" style="s2">solve my inside problem but we have good</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.030" end="01:25:49.840" style="s2">evidence and argument for thinking</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.590" end="01:25:50.590" style="s2">that&#39;s not right and I&#39;m going to add to</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.840" end="01:25:53.650" style="s2">it in one minute</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.590" end="01:25:55.000" style="s2">namely is it enough to break the</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.650" end="01:25:57.540" style="s2">inappropriate frame of the nine dot</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.000" end="01:25:59.220" style="s2">problem to solve the 9.50</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.540" end="01:26:00.750" style="s2">for the mother right and so if you keep</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.220" end="01:26:03.780" style="s2">breaking and breaking when you need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.750" end="01:26:04.920" style="s2">restructure what is to restructure which</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.780" end="01:26:07.470" style="s2">direction do you have to move to</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.920" end="01:26:09.090" style="s2">restructure at the no time right so you</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.470" end="01:26:11.160" style="s2">just keep breaking frame you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.090" end="01:26:13.950" style="s2">choke because you have to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.160" end="01:26:15.420" style="s2">that shift like to the right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.950" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">the argument to make you have that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.420" end="01:26:18.330" style="s2">the argument also means the next point</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:20.640" style="s2">I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.330" end="01:26:23.160" style="s2">okay so in order so that we can talk</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.640" end="01:26:25.050" style="s2">about these two directions right there</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.160" end="01:26:26.490" style="s2">and because they taught this come from</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.050" end="01:26:29.490" style="s2">me I&#39;m allowed to make up the other term</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.490" end="01:26:34.080" style="s2">right I&#39;m going to call this breaking</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.490" end="01:26:35.730" style="s2">frame and this making frame what I want</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.080" end="01:26:37.440" style="s2">to show you right now is that we have</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.730" end="01:26:38.970" style="s2">evidence of moving in this opposite</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.440" end="01:26:41.490" style="s2">direction is also powerfully</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.970" end="01:26:43.020" style="s2">facilitating stuff so if you start to</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.490" end="01:26:44.790" style="s2">add this all together trying to get the</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.020" end="01:26:46.980" style="s2">single difficulty hypothesis becomes</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.790" end="01:26:49.530" style="s2">increasingly difficult okay sorry that</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.980" end="01:27:04.470" style="s2">was self referential yeah it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.530" end="01:27:06.750" style="s2">ironically postmodern where self and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.470" end="01:27:08.730" style="s2">then we keep putting out the problem</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.750" end="01:27:15.590" style="s2">with sort of mapping on sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.730" end="01:27:15.590" style="s2">procedural tactics with actually</p>

<p begin="01:35:04.100" end="01:35:14.120" style="s2">break frame and you should do this so in</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.560" end="01:35:16.340" style="s2">in a paper that myself a mayoral wants a</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.120" end="01:35:21.800" style="s2">book chapter came up 2016 we call this</p>

<p begin="01:35:27.440" end="01:35:36.500" style="s2">attention down we also need an</p>

<p begin="01:36:08.960" end="01:36:17.090" style="s2">stone okay so the idea is if you track</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.630" end="01:36:18.410" style="s2">in an inappropriate problem formulation</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.090" end="01:36:20.810" style="s2">perhaps because it&#39;s called it&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="01:36:40.250" end="01:36:47.579" style="s2">need to come up with an alternative play</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.270" end="01:36:49.829" style="s2">an alternative problem formulation</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.579" end="01:36:53.520" style="s2">when you&#39;re in that phase you should</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.829" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">scale attention up in order to trigger</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.520" end="01:37:03.690" style="s2">the processes of brain making a part of</p>

<p begin="01:37:03.690" end="01:37:07.260" style="s2">where I&#39;ve been arguing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.920" end="01:37:09.260" style="s2">procedural in scale like a nature is of</p>

<p begin="01:37:09.260" end="01:37:23.489" style="s2">coordinated well now there&#39;s two ways of</p>

<p begin="01:37:25.500" end="01:37:30.599" style="s2">would be to show how this helps us to</p>

<p begin="01:37:30.599" end="01:37:36.270" style="s2">mindfulness practices or facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.869" end="01:37:40.500" style="s2">insight secondly we have independent</p>

<p begin="01:37:40.500" end="01:37:44.579" style="s2">or at least the process of networking</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.079" end="01:37:47.460" style="s2">insight are showing this kind of</p>

<p begin="01:37:47.460" end="01:37:54.480" style="s2">capacity this will we&#39;ll take a look at</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.260" end="01:37:56.159" style="s2">the work of Stephanie Dixon about my top</p>

<p begin="01:38:11.520" end="01:38:14.940" style="s2">especially because they&#39;ve done very</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.630" end="01:38:16.980" style="s2">well on things like neural networks</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.940" end="01:38:19.500" style="s2">because no one that works right are</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.980" end="01:38:22.440" style="s2">already working and they stop organizing</p>

<p begin="01:38:35.270" end="01:38:45.590" style="s2">to be able to integrate aspects of such</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.720" end="01:38:48.080" style="s2">dynamical theories so that we can think</p>

<p begin="01:38:48.080" end="01:38:51.140" style="s2">won&#39;t do any heavy math with you</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.700" end="01:38:52.850" style="s2">that could be brought to bear to talk</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.140" end="01:38:54.790" style="s2">about all these processes and our being</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.850" end="01:38:58.340" style="s2">already brought today in fact the case</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.790" end="01:38:59.690" style="s2">then we could have a way of talking</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.340" end="01:39:03.170" style="s2">about all of this</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.690" end="01:39:07.030" style="s2">that is non-computational but yet</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.170" end="01:39:10.220" style="s2">nevertheless is based on existing theory</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.030" end="01:39:13.790" style="s2">that already is successfully being used</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.220" end="01:39:14.630" style="s2">in science and our mathematical</p>

<p begin="01:39:14.630" end="01:39:19.220" style="s2">that are already existence in other</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.880" end="01:39:21.320" style="s2">words to put in the sentence we could</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.220" end="01:39:23.060" style="s2">have as rid of the risk of theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.320" end="01:39:28.010" style="s2">framework as a search inference</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.060" end="01:39:30.380" style="s2">framework what I&#39;m proposing to you is</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.010" end="01:39:32.900" style="s2">that perhaps we&#39;re getting to a place so</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.380" end="01:39:36.020" style="s2">this is this is not only in this lecture</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.900" end="01:39:37.760" style="s2">maybe not even in the next lecture when</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.020" end="01:39:39.590" style="s2">I try and argue that the debate between</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.760" end="01:39:41.180" style="s2">the gestalt ists and the search entrance</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.590" end="01:39:43.310" style="s2">framework hasn&#39;t been resolved is the</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.180" end="01:39:46.340" style="s2">transcended that there&#39;s a new framework</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.310" end="01:39:48.530" style="s2">of bridging that takes aspects from both</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.340" end="01:39:50.600" style="s2">to come up with a different way of</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.530" end="01:39:54.620" style="s2">trying to readers they talk about insert</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.600" end="01:39:57.440" style="s2">on solving a way that also is giving us</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.620" end="01:39:59.350" style="s2">much tighter connections to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.440" end="01:40:01.780" style="s2">happening in the neuroscience of insight</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.350" end="01:40:04.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s where the argument is going</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.780" end="01:40:07.520" style="s2">okay so so three big steps</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.690" end="01:40:11.560" style="s2">the mindfulness steps the self</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.520" end="01:40:16.490" style="s2">organizing stuff and then getting into</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.560" end="01:40:18.290" style="s2">this way of trying to come up with an</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.490" end="01:40:20.780" style="s2">alternative framework for talking about</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.290" end="01:40:22.990" style="s2">insight that would capture the best of</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.780" end="01:40:22.990" style="s2">both worlds</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.800" end="01:40:29.300" style="s2">okay the mindfulness stuff which many</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.260" end="01:40:29.710" style="s2">people often find the most interesting</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.300" end="01:40:32.230" style="s2">part of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.710" end="01:40:33.850" style="s2">course which now by saying that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.230" end="01:40:35.739" style="s2"> you concentrate on the feature of</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.850" end="01:40:37.660" style="s2">interestingness and it will disappear</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.739" end="01:40:39.790" style="s2">for you because it will be automatron</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.660" end="01:40:43.120" style="s2">your interest and energetic attention</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.790" end="01:40:44.739" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the last thing you</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.120" end="01:40:46.420" style="s2">should do when you look at somebody and</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.739" end="01:40:48.280" style="s2">you think they&#39;re beautiful is wonder</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.420" end="01:40:49.750" style="s2">yeah wonder why I think that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.280" end="01:40:51.160" style="s2">beautiful because you know what will</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.750" end="01:40:53.710" style="s2">happen they will stop being beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.160" end="01:40:55.300" style="s2">for you because you beauty is tends to</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.710" end="01:40:57.430" style="s2">be a gestalt thing and will plop down at</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.300" end="01:40:59.590" style="s2">a deeper level and left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.430" end="01:41:01.660" style="s2">rapidly looking for the feature that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.590" end="01:41:04.510" style="s2">beauty oh that&#39;s right and people find</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.660" end="01:41:05.950" style="s2">it okay so some questions perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.510" end="01:41:09.180" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be asked or at least they</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.950" end="01:41:09.180" style="s2">should to be asked at the wrong time</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.350" end="01:41:17.770" style="s2">although you can use it in any other way</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.090" end="01:41:19.420" style="s2">like I&#39;ve said time for a really great</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.770" end="01:41:21.550" style="s2">thing to do when you&#39;re in martial arts</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.420" end="01:41:23.080" style="s2">farming is compliment somebody on</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.550" end="01:41:24.310" style="s2">something they&#39;re just done that was</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.080" end="01:41:37.770" style="s2">really good how did you do that because</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.310" end="01:41:37.770" style="s2">then I can do it okay so first of all</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.150" end="01:41:44.980" style="s2">welcome into too much detail I do this</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.830" end="01:41:45.910" style="s2">into other courses and when I 471 which</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.980" end="01:41:47.140" style="s2">I won&#39;t be doing this year we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.910" end="01:41:49.120" style="s2">probably do again the following year</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.140" end="01:41:50.530" style="s2">when we talk about the monocles contract</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.120" end="01:41:52.050" style="s2">I have a hold for tier seven of course</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.530" end="01:41:55.690" style="s2">dedicated did any of you take that</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.050" end="01:41:57.040" style="s2">anybody do 471 comments to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.690" end="01:41:59.860" style="s2">almost good nobody&#39;s home person in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.040" end="01:42:03.280" style="s2">course okay so what we have is we have a</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.860" end="01:42:06.880" style="s2">series of experiments that seem to show</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.280" end="01:42:11.969" style="s2">that practicing mindfulness enhances</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.880" end="01:42:11.969" style="s2">insight so read it out in 2010</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.800" end="01:42:24.800" style="s2">and then pasta Panem - captain why not</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.800" end="01:42:25.999" style="s2">have been contacted me wants to do some</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.800" end="01:42:29.780" style="s2">work together on this stuff which is</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.999" end="01:42:41.689" style="s2">kind of cool also going to counseling</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.780" end="01:42:44.360" style="s2">which is 2012 some of you know this got</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.689" end="01:42:50.709" style="s2">a year of course topic proposals and</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.360" end="01:42:58.459" style="s2">then green Greenberg liner and mirin</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.709" end="01:43:01.209" style="s2">2012 also LTS started really really poor</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.459" end="01:43:06.340" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.209" end="01:43:06.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch it&#39;s a pasta thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.479" end="01:43:18.650" style="s2">called second of history and then I read</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.420" end="01:43:22.900" style="s2">you the list of names so I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.650" end="01:43:22.900" style="s2">to put your greenberg it out in 2012</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.760" end="01:43:29.959" style="s2">there&#39;s been some more recent ones that</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.840" end="01:43:33.409" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard from kind of for them before</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.959" end="01:43:36.320" style="s2">it all within an election so all of</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.409" end="01:43:38.300" style="s2">these showing that if you so for example</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.320" end="01:43:40.579" style="s2">the red house you have people following</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.300" end="01:43:42.139" style="s2">your breath laughing they take the pass</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.579" end="01:43:43.880" style="s2">now pointless exercise</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.139" end="01:43:45.709" style="s2">so people are following their breath</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.880" end="01:43:47.239" style="s2">right and what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.709" end="01:43:49.159" style="s2">counting your breath and they need to</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.239" end="01:43:52.039" style="s2">put up their hand every 10 reps or every</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.159" end="01:43:53.420" style="s2">hundred left controller but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.039" end="01:43:55.550" style="s2">expectedly people are giving insight</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.420" end="01:43:57.170" style="s2">problems to solve and people who were</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.550" end="01:44:03.219" style="s2">following the breath do significantly</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.170" end="01:44:05.929" style="s2">better than people who want it cetera so</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.219" end="01:44:08.630" style="s2">automatic osmond were able to show that</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.929" end="01:44:12.050" style="s2">both trait and a mindfulness included</p>

<p begin="01:44:15.760" end="01:44:21.820" style="s2">should use dispositional and a current</p>

<p begin="01:50:01.010" end="01:50:09.340" style="s2">of the things you&#39;re training right in</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.460" end="01:50:13.190" style="s2">meditation things like the optimization</p>

<p begin="01:50:24.440" end="01:50:30.010" style="s2">the thing that faces you of course is</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.020" end="01:50:32.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s something like what you can</p>

<p begin="01:51:08.520" end="01:51:16.080" style="s2">how we&#39;re framing the part experience</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.380" end="01:51:17.670" style="s2">like my godson and what you&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.080" end="01:51:19.850" style="s2">mindfulness practice is you&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="01:51:19.850" end="01:51:24.960" style="s2">remind kind of look at the sensations</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.560" end="01:51:26.880" style="s2">and how your mind is trying to consult</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.960" end="01:51:29.430" style="s2">and frame things and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.880" end="01:51:32.310" style="s2">hold off from going into the consulting</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.430" end="01:51:33.690" style="s2">and the framing now what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.310" end="01:51:34.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a cognitive Stroop effect just</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.690" end="01:51:36.300" style="s2">like it&#39;s very hard for you to pay</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.920" end="01:51:38.480" style="s2">attention to the medium of the work</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.300" end="01:51:41.070" style="s2">instead of looking through the medium</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.480" end="01:51:42.750" style="s2">what happens is right when you try to</p>

<p begin="01:53:55.540" end="01:54:00.340" style="s2">important part is to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.090" end="01:54:03.520" style="s2">you put breathing what&#39;s not helping if</p>

<p begin="01:54:22.690" end="01:54:25.780" style="s2">benefits</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.500" end="01:54:27.460" style="s2">I think that&#39;s why it&#39;s a typical focus</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.780" end="01:54:29.110" style="s2">I agree with what you&#39;re saying I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="01:54:29.110" end="01:54:32.500" style="s2">where it&#39;s exercise now I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.030" end="01:54:34.360" style="s2">a critiquing what you&#39;re saying Jake is</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.500" end="01:54:35.410" style="s2">right and this is part of the mystique</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.360" end="01:54:37.660" style="s2">of mindfulness that you&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.410" end="01:54:39.400" style="s2">criticize later in prac right is it</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.660" end="01:54:41.199" style="s2">there&#39;s some magic associated with the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.400" end="01:54:43.540" style="s2">breath and some people get all weird and</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.199" end="01:54:45.340" style="s2">creepy about it like you know rap and</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.540" end="01:54:47.590" style="s2">the original meaning of the word spirits</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.340" end="01:54:50.219" style="s2">was drunk and so this is a spirit Annika</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.590" end="01:54:54.820" style="s2">and I want these people to get away from</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.219" end="01:54:56.260" style="s2">the community so although I think people</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.820" end="01:54:58.120" style="s2">and people are being real it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.260" end="01:55:00.820" style="s2">there&#39;s practical reasons why it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.120" end="01:55:04.750" style="s2">to focus on the problem but you should</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.820" end="01:55:06.489" style="s2">understand what who is doing that really</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.750" end="01:55:08.699" style="s2">is the cognitive attentional processes</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.489" end="01:55:10.810" style="s2">the attentional processes that are</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.699" end="01:55:13.150" style="s2">applications that not anything</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.810" end="01:55:14.920" style="s2">intrinsically to the breath per se sorry</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.150" end="01:55:18.910" style="s2">I ranted a bit but he gave you every</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.920" end="01:55:22.360" style="s2">opportunity to say hello it&#39;s the aim of</p>

<p begin="01:55:22.360" end="01:55:32.739" style="s2">every situation so like for example in</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.489" end="01:55:34.719" style="s2">your studies well that&#39;s more again I</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.739" end="01:55:36.810" style="s2">think that&#39;s a misinterpretation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.719" end="01:55:40.540" style="s2">been taken into the West which is that</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.810" end="01:55:42.640" style="s2">mindfulness mindfulness is the state of</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.540" end="01:55:45.010" style="s2">the state that you&#39;re supposed to get</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.640" end="01:55:46.150" style="s2">that Michael the state is equivalent to</p>

<p begin="01:55:46.150" end="01:55:56.230" style="s2">meditative which isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.800" end="01:55:58.239" style="s2">correct right mindfulness is meditation</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.230" end="01:56:01.210" style="s2">is a good way of training mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.239" end="01:56:05.110" style="s2">but in but think about what think about</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.210" end="01:56:06.760" style="s2">the past enough the eternal that Maples</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.110" end="01:56:13.030" style="s2">do you know what the past the translates</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.760" end="01:56:16.870" style="s2">as in say the point of this practice is</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.030" end="01:56:18.790" style="s2">to generate insight so typically when</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.870" end="01:56:20.530" style="s2">people and this is how I was thought</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.790" end="01:56:23.110" style="s2">you&#39;re not taught just meditative</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.530" end="01:56:25.930" style="s2">practices you also talk contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.110" end="01:56:28.449" style="s2">practices as well and you&#39;re also part</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.930" end="01:56:30.400" style="s2">of moving flow induction practice so I</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.449" end="01:56:33.310" style="s2">was taught I was taught the past not</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.400" end="01:56:35.110" style="s2">mess up and touch each one because the</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.310" end="01:56:38.980" style="s2">point is the cognitive flexibility</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.110" end="01:56:42.250" style="s2">the point is minima is to not only train</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.980" end="01:56:46.360" style="s2">this but to train this and to train the</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.250" end="01:56:48.700" style="s2">capacity for flow so that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.360" end="01:56:50.740" style="s2">actually trying to enhance is the</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.700" end="01:56:52.810" style="s2">cognitive flexibility of breaking frame</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.740" end="01:57:02.290" style="s2">and making things we try to train that</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.810" end="01:57:05.020" style="s2">skill you&#39;re not by meditating your life</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.290" end="01:57:06.820" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get better at right so</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.020" end="01:57:09.190" style="s2">I think mindfulness is the frame</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.820" end="01:57:12.730" style="s2">awareness that you have to have for both</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.190" end="01:57:14.200" style="s2">rating frame and making prayer now I</p>

<p begin="01:58:48.840" end="01:58:53.219" style="s2">a contemplative practice some martial</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.360" end="01:58:58.130" style="s2">art practice and also a healing process</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.219" end="01:58:58.130" style="s2">like that&#39;s the typical training regime</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.139" end="01:59:04.079" style="s2">this time your hand is up see my</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.190" end="01:59:05.670" style="s2">peripheral vision yeah not now is</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.079" end="01:59:10.230" style="s2">ignoring you because you would do a so</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.670" end="01:59:15.469" style="s2">much oh I can hallucinogenic drugs have</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.230" end="01:59:17.909" style="s2">a similar effect meditation yeah I need</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.469" end="01:59:19.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a couple talks there&#39;s one on</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.909" end="01:59:19.769" style="s2">YouTube on altered states of</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.110" end="01:59:22.170" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.769" end="01:59:24.840" style="s2">I just gave one that was filmed taped</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.170" end="01:59:27.900" style="s2">onto mycelium about being I know the</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.840" end="01:59:33.750" style="s2">thing I know but is psilocybin and what</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.900" end="01:59:36.179" style="s2">it does to this kind of machinery drugs</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.750" end="01:59:41.750" style="s2">can powerfully interact with this kind</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.179" end="01:59:47.909" style="s2">of training to be careful here right</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.750" end="01:59:52.650" style="s2">there&#39;s legal implication okay but like</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.909" end="01:59:54.780" style="s2">they I mean you won&#39;t get what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.650" end="01:59:56.849" style="s2">looking for what you&#39;re looking for is</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.780" end="01:59:58.769" style="s2">the enhancement of your cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.849" end="02:00:01.079" style="s2">processes through the recreational use</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.769" end="02:00:03.119" style="s2">of this they have to be used in a</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.079" end="02:00:05.039" style="s2">particular context within like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.119" end="02:00:07.260" style="s2">arguing a whole ecology of practice in</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.039" end="02:00:11.760" style="s2">order to get the kinds of effects you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.260" end="02:00:14.670" style="s2">asking me about um also like like in</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.760" end="02:00:20.010" style="s2">both you know meditation and quite</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.670" end="02:00:22.949" style="s2">experimental you noticed like an</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.010" end="02:00:25.050" style="s2">increased ability to like notice other</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.949" end="02:00:25.650" style="s2">people&#39;s emotions sure and there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.050" end="02:00:28.110" style="s2">reason for that</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.650" end="02:00:29.610" style="s2">yeah so when you&#39;re doing this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.110" end="02:00:31.409" style="s2">stuff especially in your practices</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.610" end="02:00:35.150" style="s2">that&#39;s by the way way to do a healing or</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.409" end="02:00:37.469" style="s2">is welcome right you&#39;re actually so deep</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.150" end="02:00:39.360" style="s2">you know what interception is</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.469" end="02:00:41.909" style="s2">interception is your awareness of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.360" end="02:00:44.429" style="s2">going on inside your own body yeah okay</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.909" end="02:00:46.949" style="s2">so the part of the brain that does that</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.429" end="02:00:48.869" style="s2">is the insula and we have some</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.949" end="02:00:50.550" style="s2">preliminary evidence in defense reason</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.869" end="02:00:52.039" style="s2">that meditative practice would actually</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.550" end="02:00:54.679" style="s2">increase the functioning of the end</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.039" end="02:00:57.469" style="s2">but the insula is also what you use to</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.679" end="02:00:59.780" style="s2">pick up on other people&#39;s mental states</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.469" end="02:01:02.150" style="s2">in fact this is a pretty robust test the</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.780" end="02:01:03.889" style="s2">heart rate test is a good test of how in</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.150" end="02:01:07.429" style="s2">a pic you own so without touching</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.889" end="02:01:08.989" style="s2">yourself sort it but something to do in</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.429" end="02:01:12.889" style="s2">the next 15 seconds is tell me how many</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.989" end="02:01:14.539" style="s2">heartbeats you have and then up in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.889" end="02:01:16.369" style="s2">next 15 seconds or when you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.539" end="02:01:18.079" style="s2">anxious about it actually measure how</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.369" end="02:01:21.139" style="s2">many heartbeats job and see what the</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.079" end="02:01:22.789" style="s2">ratio is how good you are at that is</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.139" end="02:01:25.340" style="s2">predictive of how good you are picking</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.789" end="02:01:27.829" style="s2">up on other people&#39;s mental states so</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.340" end="02:01:29.900" style="s2">there seems to be the machinery there</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.829" end="02:01:31.429" style="s2">that&#39;s you and this seems to be part and</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.900" end="02:01:33.949" style="s2">this is what your network theory is</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.429" end="02:01:35.750" style="s2">basically pointing towards the machinery</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.949" end="02:01:38.420" style="s2">in essence to sort of generate our</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.750" end="02:01:41.210" style="s2">abilities is the machinery we are using</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.420" end="02:01:44.269" style="s2">to recognize it in other people okay</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.210" end="02:01:45.530" style="s2">that actually um that feeling falls in</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.269" end="02:01:47.179" style="s2">line with what I was thinking before</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.530" end="02:01:50.960" style="s2">could like I was thinking before like</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.179" end="02:01:53.059" style="s2">the reason why promotion for meditation</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.960" end="02:01:56.809" style="s2">makes you better at meeting others</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.059" end="02:01:59.210" style="s2">because like every other person has like</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.809" end="02:02:00.800" style="s2">a sort of like like emotional energy</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.210" end="02:02:02.869" style="s2">their goal to be long and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.800" end="02:02:05.360" style="s2">around them that that energy comes into</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.869" end="02:02:06.650" style="s2">you and if you meditate or you do much</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.360" end="02:02:09.079" style="s2">and you become more in touch with</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.650" end="02:02:10.280" style="s2">yourself as you can notice ya energy</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.079" end="02:02:11.780" style="s2">coming in to you better you can have</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.280" end="02:02:15.320" style="s2">some result sure but up decipher their</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.780" end="02:02:16.610" style="s2">emotions that&#39;s right and I mean and I</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.320" end="02:02:18.230" style="s2">get that you&#39;re using that language</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.610" end="02:02:19.610" style="s2">poetically metaphorically but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.230" end="02:02:21.650" style="s2">have to talk about emotional energy</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.610" end="02:02:23.960" style="s2">things like that if you talk about the</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.650" end="02:02:26.539" style="s2">language of the insula and this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.960" end="02:02:28.849" style="s2">stuff yeah so I mean one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.539" end="02:02:30.230" style="s2">that will happen is if if they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.849" end="02:02:32.059" style="s2">the state and it is lots of people doing</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.230" end="02:02:34.369" style="s2">work on this right but if this keeps</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.059" end="02:02:36.019" style="s2">going forward right a lot of the magic</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.369" end="02:02:37.340" style="s2">and woowoo and crazy stuff is going to</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.019" end="02:02:40.280" style="s2">disappear from a lot of this literature</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.340" end="02:02:41.690" style="s2">some people won&#39;t like that but some</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.280" end="02:02:43.130" style="s2">people will like it because will</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.690" end="02:02:43.700" style="s2">actually get a better understanding I</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.130" end="02:02:46.190" style="s2">think of what</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.700" end="02:02:48.170" style="s2">going on in these process like ap the</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.190" end="02:02:50.060" style="s2">aquatic language to describe the better</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.170" end="02:02:52.070" style="s2">like phenomenologically in browsing life</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.060" end="02:03:00.200" style="s2">sure well that&#39;s only because we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.070" end="02:03:01.880" style="s2">had the other language yet yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.200" end="02:03:03.980" style="s2">never failed when I get to here wait</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.880" end="02:03:08.740" style="s2">wait what we do when I do flow to the</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.980" end="02:03:08.740" style="s2">lecture will crash how could I flow more</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.730" end="02:03:17.680" style="s2">yes that you can train all kinds of</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.520" end="02:03:20.240" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.680" end="02:03:21.830" style="s2">restructurings and reconnections so it</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.240" end="02:03:23.210" style="s2">is now pretty well-documented is</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.830" end="02:03:25.280" style="s2">increasing empirical evidence for a</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.210" end="02:03:27.020" style="s2">quiet synesthesia for extensive</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.280" end="02:03:33.920" style="s2">monitoring of doctors we could even</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.020" end="02:03:40.660" style="s2">become more symmetry if you want to okay</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.920" end="02:03:42.500" style="s2">so if you&#39;re going to mention many</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.660" end="02:03:44.930" style="s2">mindfulness practices are also</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.500" end="02:03:46.730" style="s2">contemplative practices now part of the</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.930" end="02:03:48.950" style="s2">problem here is I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.730" end="02:03:52.670" style="s2">what these terms actually mean because</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.950" end="02:03:54.770" style="s2">because of this weird you know reduction</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.670" end="02:03:57.230" style="s2">is our beauty in the appropriation of</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.770" end="02:03:58.970" style="s2">mindfulness so I&#39;m engaging in some</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.230" end="02:04:02.120" style="s2">critique of cultural appropriation here</p>
<p begin="02:03:58.970" end="02:04:03.860" style="s2">right now what&#39;s happened is we tended</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.120" end="02:04:06.050" style="s2">to make these two terms we tended to</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.860" end="02:04:07.730" style="s2">make a budget terms also not as we</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.050" end="02:04:09.800" style="s2">tended to make meditation and</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.730" end="02:04:11.060" style="s2">contemplation that understands it is two</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.800" end="02:04:14.000" style="s2">different ways of a talk about the same</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.060" end="02:04:15.560" style="s2">thing we&#39;ve also tended to think that</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.000" end="02:04:17.600" style="s2">the words mindfulness and watchfulness</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.560" end="02:04:19.880" style="s2">in most of the sutures are the same term</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.600" end="02:04:21.350" style="s2">we&#39;ve forgotten that they&#39;re not by the</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.880" end="02:04:23.480" style="s2">way they&#39;re different terms we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.350" end="02:04:27.170" style="s2">forgotten that the word for mindfulness</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.480" end="02:04:29.360" style="s2">in the Buddhist ideas Jackie is not just</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.170" end="02:04:31.340" style="s2">about paying attention if the original</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.360" end="02:04:32.050" style="s2">meaning of this is remembering keeping</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.340" end="02:04:35.000" style="s2">in mind</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.050" end="02:04:37.090" style="s2">global restructuring not just paying</p>

<p begin="02:04:40.160" end="02:04:45.940" style="s2">collapse when I take an entire seminar</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.840" end="02:04:48.620" style="s2">course to do contemplation meditation</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.940" end="02:04:53.840" style="s2">comes from words that mean moving</p>

<p begin="02:05:47.300" end="02:05:56.270" style="s2">are the theory allows you to do but this</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.820" end="02:06:00.550" style="s2">can be allowing you to do right or what</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.270" end="02:06:00.550" style="s2">is exclaim you will need to be aware</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.510" end="02:06:07.190" style="s2">that helps you construct the frame</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.060" end="02:06:08.840" style="s2">outright but note what allows you to do</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.190" end="02:06:11.900" style="s2">is it allows you to see deeper</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.840" end="02:06:14.450" style="s2">connections between things right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.900" end="02:06:15.800" style="s2">about you to see below the surface of</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.450" end="02:06:18.970" style="s2">things that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.800" end="02:06:24.340" style="s2">you&#39;re explaining up sort of theory does</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.970" end="02:06:28.460" style="s2">like this actually comes from right</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.340" end="02:06:30.620" style="s2">seeing the god or L you know the eyes</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.460" end="02:06:32.810" style="s2">seem it means seeing into the depth of</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.620" end="02:06:35.900" style="s2">things what if there does is allows you</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.810" end="02:06:38.450" style="s2">to understand the think of the word to</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.900" end="02:06:39.920" style="s2">see deeply into things but what it was</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.450" end="02:06:41.500" style="s2">used in this tradition it didn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.920" end="02:06:43.540" style="s2">through propositions it</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.500" end="02:06:45.580" style="s2">through training your attention of</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.540" end="02:06:49.450" style="s2">awareness to see more deeply into things</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.580" end="02:06:52.360" style="s2">so for example that&#39;s why I want to use</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.450" end="02:06:54.790" style="s2">the word contemplation for going this</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.360" end="02:07:00.010" style="s2">way this is not a patient this is</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.790" end="02:07:01.750" style="s2">concentration so for example in Buddhist</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.010" end="02:07:03.190" style="s2">practice you can and this is the word</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.750" end="02:07:07.000" style="s2">that&#39;s actually you can contemplate the</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.190" end="02:07:10.150" style="s2">three marks of existence you try to</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.000" end="02:07:11.140" style="s2">learn not to faith but to see everything</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.150" end="02:07:12.730" style="s2">is impermanent</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.140" end="02:07:14.410" style="s2">so actually realize everything is</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.730" end="02:07:16.420" style="s2">impermanent to see everything is</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.410" end="02:07:18.160" style="s2">interconnected to see everything is</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.420" end="02:07:19.930" style="s2">lacking a substantial self physical</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.160" end="02:07:21.760" style="s2">decay parts of existence this is a</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.930" end="02:07:24.550" style="s2">contemplative exercise it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.760" end="02:07:26.890" style="s2">looking in at your breath it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.550" end="02:07:28.480" style="s2">trying to make an alternative framing</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.890" end="02:07:31.510" style="s2">for all of reality it&#39;s trying to create</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.480" end="02:07:33.490" style="s2">a huge result and a huge or complication</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.510" end="02:07:36.220" style="s2">transparency ship you&#39;re trying to stop</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.490" end="02:07:37.570" style="s2">looking at these don&#39;t see them as solid</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.220" end="02:07:41.380" style="s2">independent things that look through</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.570" end="02:07:51.520" style="s2">them however you need to depend if any</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.380" end="02:07:54.390" style="s2">permanent yes now this isn&#39;t as familiar</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.520" end="02:07:57.340" style="s2">to you which is my point</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.390" end="02:07:59.370" style="s2">these practices are considered as</p>
<p begin="02:07:57.340" end="02:08:02.560" style="s2">important if not more important than</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.370" end="02:08:05.230" style="s2">meditation if you look right at the</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.560" end="02:08:09.370" style="s2">original set the original ecology</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.230" end="02:08:10.770" style="s2">practices the point of meditation was so</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.370" end="02:08:13.000" style="s2">that you could then engage a better</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.770" end="02:08:16.150" style="s2">contemplation so that you could have</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.000" end="02:08:23.260" style="s2">insight into the nature of experience</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.150" end="02:08:25.480" style="s2">and reality so if you look right these</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.260" end="02:08:27.460" style="s2">traditions have mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.480" end="02:08:29.590" style="s2">that go this way mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.460" end="02:08:31.660" style="s2">will go this way and often practice it I</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.590" end="02:08:33.760" style="s2">hope for getting a fluency and a</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.660" end="02:08:38.410" style="s2">flexibility and break this try to make</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.760" end="02:08:39.700" style="s2">your frame so when I try to show you is</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.410" end="02:08:43.870" style="s2">that this way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.700" end="02:08:45.640" style="s2">attention helps us understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.870" end="02:08:47.890" style="s2">going on in the insight especially we</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.640" end="02:08:49.450" style="s2">take all of these like processes</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.890" end="02:08:49.840" style="s2">essential processes and put them within</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.450" end="02:08:52.290" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.840" end="02:08:56.520" style="s2">Vivienne&#39;s contains a dynamically</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.290" end="02:08:59.440" style="s2">self-organizing recursive process and</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.520" end="02:09:03.250" style="s2">that that way of understanding attention</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.440" end="02:09:05.200" style="s2">also helps us to make sense of like the</p>
<p begin="02:09:03.250" end="02:09:06.520" style="s2">Western empirical evidence for the</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.200" end="02:09:09.040" style="s2">relationship between mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.520" end="02:09:11.590" style="s2">insight but also helps us to better go</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.040" end="02:09:14.290" style="s2">back and criticize that Western</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.590" end="02:09:16.300" style="s2">understanding of mindfulness and great</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.290" end="02:09:18.430" style="s2">reorient it and one or more people are</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.300" end="02:09:20.740" style="s2">doing this I&#39;m not like a lone voice of</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.430" end="02:09:23.140" style="s2">wilderness but we are at and pay</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.740" end="02:09:25.120" style="s2">attention to what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.140" end="02:09:27.070" style="s2">in these wisdom traditions that are</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.120" end="02:09:33.550" style="s2">attempting to train insight and wisdom</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.070" end="02:09:35.800" style="s2">and compassion so that&#39;s an argument for</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.550" end="02:09:39.490" style="s2">why this is a better framework then this</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.800" end="02:09:42.040" style="s2">search by title or prevention in the</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.490" end="02:09:46.210" style="s2">right way so that closes now my argument</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.040" end="02:09:48.280" style="s2">against verbal overshadow you would have</p>
