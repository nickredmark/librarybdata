<p begin="00:00:00.350" end="00:00:05.339" style="s2">Apple number seven there will be some</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.030" end="00:00:09.750" style="s2">other ones I think there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.339" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">realms where we have delegated the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.750" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">authority to our government for obvious</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:17.550" style="s2">reasons because when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">corporation against a consumer and like</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.550" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">is this going to cause cancer is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">going to destroy our planet we would</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">like to know that there&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">standing up for us especially in a world</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.900" style="s2">where the internet didn&#39;t exist and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">needed to believe the government had</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.900" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">more knowledge than we did but now that</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.540" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">the internet does exist and governments</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:41.430" style="s2">have been shown to be just as corrupt as</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">corporations it&#39;s hard for me to trust</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.430" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">them fully even though I&#39;m glad that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">they exist to some degree so be able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">take that power back I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">necessarily means lobbying and getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:57.210" style="s2">getting the power back but just starting</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">where we are and say it okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">well if I can&#39;t trust you to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">that my soil and water and air are clean</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to trust us to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">and I think part of where that happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">is in testing so to test the soil all</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">around or be live and that involves</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">community labs which is maybe another</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">whole other Apple because it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:21.590" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t happen on day one it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">there&#39;s millions of people involved not</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.590" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">one person involved and so community</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">labs but in the meantime you can have if</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">it costs instead of hundreds of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">to get your stuff tested costs $10 or $1</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">and you&#39;re able to start community labs</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">in larger cities and test the water and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:47.540" style="s2">the I don&#39;t actually know how you test</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">the air but test the soil and have</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.540" end="00:01:55.219" style="s2">temperature I mean now I&#39;m in Canada so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:57.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not in America but with Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.219" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">taking down all the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.570" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">information off the government EP I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">think it is in front Protection Agency</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">website that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">that should never be allowed to happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">because it should be in the hands of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">people not the government so we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">have all the information that would have</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">been available there available on backup</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:14.850" style="s2">so it&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">take it down because we happen I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.850" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">they do actually I think they knew that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:20.250" style="s2">was going to kind of happen and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">information what that was on their</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.250" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">husband saved but anyway that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.459" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">off all the way but be able to own our</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.410" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">own information to be able to map the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:39.870" style="s2">help of soil and water all over the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">world because we do it so I could to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.870" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">take it from my backyard and if my</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:45.000" style="s2">neighbors agreed I could take it from</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">their backyards</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.000" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">I could take it from by the road and by</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">I mean but when it&#39;s hundreds of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">to test it then that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:59.250" style="s2">really impossible for me to afford that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">but if there were ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">who did that through okay Cooper and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">were able to get a deal so it was you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">dollars so it was ten dollars per sample</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.900" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">that would be more feasible and each</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:19.410" style="s2">person puts in ten ten dollars and gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:21.750" style="s2">our soil and we plot it that&#39;s yes one</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">of the ideas is we take back the EPA and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.750" end="00:03:25.410" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s like a small section of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:27.299" style="s2">EPA that&#39;s just like soil and water</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.410" end="00:03:30.769" style="s2">testing but where we have community labs</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.299" end="00:03:32.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re able to do our own testing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.769" end="00:03:34.440" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.880" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">doing it and ten thousand people say in</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:37.650" style="s2">their soil sample there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">less likely to be corruption or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.650" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">ability to false have false data if</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">you&#39;re all in the same lab that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.860" style="s2">another another issue probably would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">but as we are able to send in samples</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">all over the world to different</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">organizations and follow it I think we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">have will just have way more information</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">which gold make us more powerful</p>
