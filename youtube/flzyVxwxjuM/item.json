    "title": "Session 2 - Outrageous Love & Unique Self",
    "description": "In this delightful conversation from the Center for Integral Wisdom's course Becoming A Future Human, Daniel remarks that Marc brought in so many key pieces that if fully understood and embodied within humanity, could alleviate much of the social problems that currently exist.\n\nThey point out that the three of them coming together to create this course is the evolutionary process in action. If they did not love each other, they could not do this. By loving each other, they create a synergy that moves the evolutionary story forward. If they egoically claimed this story, then they couldn’t move it forward. They honor each other’s uniqueness, and in witnessing each other shine with divine pride from sharing their teachings, they are radically loving each other. Synergy is really another word for outrageous love.\n\nIn this session you will learn:\n\n-Why acknowledging that evolution has an interior is a major step towards addressing philosophical materialism\n\n-What synergy is and the central role it plays in evolution\n\n-Barbara’s Three E’s of Evolutionary Consciousness\n\n-A mistake people often make about the role of randomness in evolution\n\n-The distinction between randomness and disaster\n\n-How Unique Self-ends comparison and competition\n\n-How to reclaim the word obligation\n\nJoin the entire course: \nhttps://ciwprograms.com/courses/becoming-a-future-human-with-barbara-marx-hubbard-marc-gafni-daniel-schmachtenberger/",
