<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:06.180" style="s2">mark that was so incredibly powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.510" end="00:00:09.660" style="s2">how many things got wrapped in tied</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.180" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">together and actually sequenced in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">time was really mind-blowing for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">watching starting with the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">story of universe that Barbara shared</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:22.769" style="s2">and really sharing it as a love story</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">and then taking that into unique cells</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.769" end="00:00:26.359" style="s2">and then unique self Symphony and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">foreshadowed in the future in that way</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.359" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">is just a really clear and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">progression and I think I felt that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">really took the evolutionary story the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">barber chairs are powerfully last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">and got a deep in it in meaningful ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:42.540" style="s2">and the two major parts that I really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">heard is this outrageous love is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.540" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">driver of universe and the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:48.920" style="s2">and all the elements of both of those</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">and to comment on the outrageous love</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.920" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">that the evolutionary story has in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">interior that there&#39;s consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:58.440" style="s2">goes with it is a huge step right from</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">materialism and then that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.440" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">has its own interior the interior of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">interiors you called it which is love</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:07.619" style="s2">that the evolution side of the inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">impulse is driving that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.619" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">powerful beautiful story and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">different words the way I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">about it is that emergence and evolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">is really driven it or described by</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">emergence fundamentally novel things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">that emergence comes from synergy</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">synergy the whole being more than sum of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">its parts is really what drives</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">fundamental novelty coming about and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">that synergy comes from relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:35.689" style="s2">comes from togetherness which is driven</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">by attractive forces and that love as</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.689" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">the great attractive force if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">think of it that way we have we have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">physical attractive forces in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">interior corollary of that as love and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">that at the deepest level the interior</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">and exterior are mirrors of the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">writing exactly so that really we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">this Universal attractive force driving</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">relationship driving synergy driving</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:02.579" style="s2">emergence driving evolution it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">such a powerful frame for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">universe story yeah no no complete</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">Daniel I mean let&#39;s look at it you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">just make it kind of complete practical</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">Barbara Daniel mark sitting here synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:15.270" style="s2">so what as soon as you mean as you say</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:17.430" style="s2">energy means that the whole is greater</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:19.530" style="s2">than the sum of its parts what allows</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.430" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">the three of us to sit here we love each</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.530" end="00:02:23.910" style="s2">other if we didn&#39;t love each other we</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do this it wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.910" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">but if we love each other we create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">synergy and then we actually moved the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">evolutionary story forward and if any of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">us would egoic Li claim this story right</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.960" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">then we couldn&#39;t move it forward now at</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">the same time we can&#39;t disappear so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">Barbara Wright reminds it reminds us not</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:45.240" style="s2">as an ego as a unique self and I coined</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">the term conscious evolution because</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.240" end="00:02:51.180" style="s2">she&#39;s saying this was Barbara Ness and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">that&#39;s actually divine pride it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">delight of being unique self and I went</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">and I developed eniac self and Daniel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:59.820" style="s2">gonna write so we don&#39;t disappear we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">actually shine but in our shining we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.820" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">radically loving each other which is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:06.030" style="s2">process of the cosmos so that process</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:07.350" style="s2">that&#39;s happening right here is happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.030" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">all the way up and all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.350" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the synergy that drives evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">and that creates a synergy is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">another word for evolutionary level</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">outrageous love beautiful right</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">and the little distinction just tagging</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">then I wanna hear Barbara&#39;s thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:24.960" style="s2">it is that synergy of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">identical is much less interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.960" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">energy of things that are differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:30.090" style="s2">and so it&#39;s this differentiate and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:32.010" style="s2">integrate process that leaves a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.090" end="00:03:33.210" style="s2">emergence exactly I want to hear Barbara</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.010" end="00:03:36.330" style="s2">but there&#39;s so much to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.210" end="00:03:38.970" style="s2">Barbara Barbara talk well I mean to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.330" end="00:03:42.660" style="s2">but the the thing that has always amazed</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.970" end="00:03:45.930" style="s2">me about evolution is it&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.660" end="00:03:48.270" style="s2">allurement mmm that the entire process</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.930" end="00:03:50.880" style="s2">is built on attraction you know from</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.270" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">quarks to subatomic particles all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.880" end="00:03:56.820" style="s2">way through to us sitting here talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">and I wanted to bring up a thought that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.820" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">I forgot to mention but then I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.790" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">relate it to what you said and it was my</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">groping for the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:09.240" style="s2">evolutionary consciousness mmm it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">really inherent in what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.240" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">and I coined three ease the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">element of evolutionary consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">would be the eternal the one the source</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:27.070" style="s2">the infinite the second E is embody</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">because the amazing thing is each of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.070" end="00:04:32.110" style="s2">embodies from the subatomic particle all</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">the way on up to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.110" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">reptilians that mainly in the knee</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">we are embodying the entire story</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">sitting here so if this is outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:46.630" style="s2">love the story is outrageous love and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:51.100" style="s2">then the next word is emergence emerge</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.630" end="00:04:53.710" style="s2">so eternal embody emerge because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.100" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">always that love is creative</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.710" end="00:05:00.310" style="s2">it&#39;s emergent its emergent and then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">last thought here would be is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.310" end="00:05:07.870" style="s2">definition of God actually I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:10.419" style="s2">groping for weight I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.870" end="00:05:13.510" style="s2">Iliad le o--&#39;s who work on the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.419" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">Christ she&#39;s a Catholic and she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.510" end="00:05:18.340" style="s2">she&#39;s out doing all the Catholics with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">new cosmology I mean she brings them all</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.340" end="00:05:23.800" style="s2">up to up to the up to bat there but she</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">says that at the origin of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.800" end="00:05:29.080" style="s2">she sees God and Christ I said to her</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">how could you see Christ at the origin</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.080" end="00:05:35.070" style="s2">of the universe she said since it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:38.260" style="s2">vector of love and it&#39;s heading for love</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.070" end="00:05:41.590" style="s2">so I guess my question in here is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.260" end="00:05:45.880" style="s2">at the origin mmm ya know it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.590" end="00:05:47.500" style="s2">it&#39;s beautiful I mean Christ is unique</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.880" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">self you know whether we&#39;re gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.500" end="00:05:51.729" style="s2">term like Christ or whatever in church</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:55.389" style="s2">whatever that one way is Christ is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.729" end="00:05:56.830" style="s2">unique self and the unique self is is as</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.389" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">you talked about unconscious to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.830" end="00:06:01.060" style="s2">conscious evolution I like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:03.130" style="s2">unconscious to conscious uniqueness so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.060" end="00:06:05.979" style="s2">when Christ wakes up the uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.130" end="00:06:09.220" style="s2">wakes up but that strange attractor was</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.979" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">always there and you you find your eros</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.220" end="00:06:14.530" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s the fourth II before</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:16.570" style="s2">thee is erotic yeah erotic not a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.530" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">sense with exiled eros to the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.570" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the emergence is erotic right the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.940" end="00:06:23.620" style="s2">emergence itself is erotic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:25.870" style="s2">energized and alive and passionate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.620" end="00:06:28.570" style="s2">pulsating and right and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.870" end="00:06:31.330" style="s2">erotic could possibly be so unique self</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.330" end="00:06:36.790" style="s2">self has erotic intelligence right it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.849" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">finds its way to new creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.790" end="00:06:40.510" style="s2">two new synergies and again right</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:41.890" style="s2">synergies to really simple word don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.510" end="00:06:44.140" style="s2">get lost in that word synergy just means</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.890" end="00:06:46.330" style="s2">as daniel said right when the parts come</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.140" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">together they form a new whole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.330" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">eros it&#39;s a new birth yes and the great</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:55.540" style="s2">thing about since energy and Sentra P is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:58.420" style="s2">it uses chaos rate and entropy or</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.540" end="00:06:59.830" style="s2">disorder right for higher order and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.420" end="00:07:02.380" style="s2">like to bring that in because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.830" end="00:07:04.570" style="s2">so much chaos today that if you see it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.380" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">as they as the ground out of which the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.570" end="00:07:10.390" style="s2">Neuse entropy is taking place in through</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:13.690" style="s2">the outrageous love that&#39;s yeah that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.390" end="00:07:16.090" style="s2">could see truly the design even in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.690" end="00:07:18.520" style="s2">disasters yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.090" end="00:07:20.740" style="s2">important I mean it&#39;s disasters and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.520" end="00:07:23.380" style="s2">here from Daniel but you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.740" end="00:07:25.660" style="s2">chaos you know you never Lucien with</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.380" end="00:07:27.580" style="s2">others randomness randomness is one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.660" end="00:07:30.070" style="s2">the structures of evolution but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.580" end="00:07:32.530" style="s2">mistake is when people identify</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.070" end="00:07:35.590" style="s2">randomness with a universe that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.530" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">purposeful right randomness is then</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.590" end="00:07:41.200" style="s2">interpreted as a universe without telus</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:43.330" style="s2">randomness is a mechanism of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.200" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">university right it&#39;s not the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.330" end="00:07:45.940" style="s2">the universe</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">and that distinction changes the game</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.940" end="00:07:49.090" style="s2">and both to talk of course more about</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">that that was a big two sentences that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.090" end="00:07:53.080" style="s2">responding it see I&#39;m really unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:56.140" style="s2">what we&#39;re all saying randomness is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.080" end="00:07:59.290" style="s2">method but that method is actually part</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.140" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">of the method of a larger right tell us</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.290" end="00:08:03.750" style="s2">to the universe yes I just do a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:06.820" style="s2">thought in there is the rate of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.750" end="00:08:10.780" style="s2">that if there weren&#39;t randomness it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.820" end="00:08:13.690" style="s2">would be robotic universe so the you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.780" end="00:08:16.860" style="s2">might say the the risk that the creative</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.690" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">intention takes is all this randomness</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.860" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">coming together in higher and higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">order right now it&#39;s so so beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:29.890" style="s2">the risk of randomness is driven always</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">by love because we always risk freedom</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.890" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">we rescue face we love if I love you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2">willing to step back and allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">choose even when you choose against me</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.979" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">cuz I love you so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:43.090" style="s2">to fit into the context of right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.010" style="s2">biting my tongue so hard on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.090" end="00:08:46.360" style="s2">relationship between entropy and synergy</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:48.250" style="s2">and their role in that relation right</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.360" end="00:08:48.790" style="s2">right so important so tag that cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.250" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.790" end="00:08:51.490" style="s2">to it later in the course and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">explain to him what entropy means so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.490" end="00:08:55.960" style="s2">someone doesn&#39;t feel like they got lost</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">the nature of or the principle by which</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.960" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">things disorder breakdown and so as</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">Barbara mentioned last time there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:04.210" style="s2">kind of emergence through emergency</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:05.620" style="s2">there&#39;s emergency as a driver of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.210" end="00:09:08.380" style="s2">evolution and we&#39;re tagging it more now</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.620" end="00:09:11.260" style="s2">and so we&#39;re gonna really see how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.380" end="00:09:12.430" style="s2">ways that humanity has been that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.260" end="00:09:14.860" style="s2">caused the problems that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.430" end="00:09:16.510" style="s2">with now we&#39;re actually the solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.860" end="00:09:18.100" style="s2">previous problem right so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.510" end="00:09:20.290" style="s2">kind of evolutionary necessity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.100" end="00:09:24.310" style="s2">innocence in it and at the and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.290" end="00:09:26.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have to begrudge the past and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.310" end="00:09:27.820" style="s2">can&#39;t continue it and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.050" end="00:09:29.890" style="s2">recognize the evolutionary relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.820" end="00:09:31.660" style="s2">the relevance of transforming at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.890" end="00:09:33.550" style="s2">same time is really powerful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.660" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">critical and you before you make your</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.550" end="00:09:36.820" style="s2">point which I&#39;m dying to hear just for</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">the kind of really rigorous listeners</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.820" end="00:09:40.900" style="s2">let&#39;s make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:43.870" style="s2">randomness which is a mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.900" end="00:09:46.750" style="s2">evolution and disaster which is often</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.870" end="00:09:48.430" style="s2">emergent from human choice which comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.750" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">from right the possibility of human</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.430" end="00:09:51.460" style="s2">freedom so there&#39;s two kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">structures in the universe one is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.460" end="00:09:55.660" style="s2">process of randomness that happens as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">evolutionary mechanism which moves</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.660" end="00:10:00.550" style="s2">towards you know natural selection sex</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:02.080" style="s2">sexual selection moral selection for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.550" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">precise listeners and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.080" end="00:10:06.010" style="s2">disaster right the crisis that creates</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:07.960" style="s2">new opportunity which are two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.010" end="00:10:10.060" style="s2">structures of the cosmos let&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.960" end="00:10:12.250" style="s2">of hold them yeah distinguish them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.060" end="00:10:14.170" style="s2">different and deeply related and will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.250" end="00:10:15.790" style="s2">different again we have to have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.170" end="00:10:18.100" style="s2">rank this is the whole story right right</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.790" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">this is exciting so this is the second</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.100" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">major thing that you share that really</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.400" end="00:10:26.110" style="s2">has to do with unique self the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:27.400" style="s2">time I ever heard about you and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">even really pay attention to your name I</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.400" end="00:10:30.220" style="s2">just saw it like five years before we</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.050" end="00:10:32.470" style="s2">met and I didn&#39;t know who you were I saw</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.220" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">something there was a talk you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.470" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">called challenging the dogma of oneness</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:39.310" style="s2">or something like this and it had this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:44.280" style="s2">just a little brief blurb on unique self</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.310" end="00:10:47.140" style="s2">and it hit me as so critically necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.280" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">important profound a teaching because</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.140" end="00:10:53.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re bringing together is utter</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">interconnectedness and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.110" end="00:10:56.350" style="s2">differentiated unique role within that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:57.340" style="s2">interconnectedness that&#39;s what allows</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.350" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">synergy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.340" end="00:11:01.150" style="s2">meaningful because synergy of one thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:02.770" style="s2">with itself unity of one thing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.150" end="00:11:03.340" style="s2">itself is not very interesting right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.770" end="00:11:05.650" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.340" end="00:11:07.900" style="s2">the differentiate integrate Drive</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.650" end="00:11:11.500" style="s2">novelty that&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.900" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">and so to say true self and then unique</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:18.820" style="s2">expression of true self which ends up</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:20.410" style="s2">leading to a rio nning of obligation as</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.820" end="00:11:22.690" style="s2">you like to call it right but not as</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.410" end="00:11:24.460" style="s2">dogma as a there&#39;s a role I have to play</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.690" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">for University nobody else could play</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.460" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">and if I don&#39;t someone won&#39;t play it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:28.840" style="s2">they&#39;ll play their role but universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:29.950" style="s2">will be less if I play it less fully I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.840" end="00:11:32.020" style="s2">mean it would have been otherwise so</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.950" end="00:11:35.740" style="s2">there&#39;s this you know second-tier kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.020" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">of Dharma that it&#39;s a duty that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.740" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">beautiful and and almost the part that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:43.750" style="s2">love the most is I have to do that and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">can&#39;t do any other and yet I want the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.750" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">others to occur and so that my heart</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t shut down I&#39;m gonna focus on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:49.840" style="s2">mine but I also have to trust that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:53.140" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do yours and I want you</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.840" end="00:11:55.330" style="s2">to so rather than compete with you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.140" end="00:11:57.880" style="s2">keep my heart open I need you to do your</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.330" end="00:12:00.190" style="s2">Dharma to your unique self - and I need</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.880" end="00:12:02.650" style="s2">Barbara to do hers - and so when you say</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.190" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">that jealousy and competition ends with</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.650" end="00:12:06.760" style="s2">uniqueness because you can only compete</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:08.260" style="s2">on the same metric right when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.760" end="00:12:10.930" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re fundamentally unique</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.260" end="00:12:13.570" style="s2">my fullest expression you&#39;re metric</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.930" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">could never be compared and yet they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.570" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">totally symbiotic and the floor you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">expressed your is the better universe I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">live in and the mark and express mine it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:23.920" style="s2">solves most of the human problems that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:25.690" style="s2">exist an exciting social model that it&#39;s</p>
