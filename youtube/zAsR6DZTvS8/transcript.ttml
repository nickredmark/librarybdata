<p begin="00:00:07.280" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been surprised that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:12.929" style="s2">been able to teach what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">teaching in the Universities because</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.929" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve always regarded it as crazily</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">radical in a sense you know it&#39;s crazily</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.769" style="s2">radical in a conservative way I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">know what to make of that your teaching</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.769" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">is crazily radical in a conservative way</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s in a conservative way</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:30.779" style="s2">because I think that the past is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">only has value its we cannot live</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.779" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">without the integration of the past no</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">more than you can live as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">without integrating your past</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:44.120" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re historical creatures right</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">and and we without if we&#39;re not united</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.120" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">can&#39;t consciously with the past then</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:54.539" style="s2">were divided internally and socially and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">that has consequences so some of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.539" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">are playing it themselves out in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">political divisions in the current world</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">but the consequences can be fatal so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">know what&#39;s the saying a house divided</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">amongst itself cannot stand</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">right exactly and the house is a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">very to the degree that any symbol is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">universal the house is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">universal symbol for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">structure of the psyche so yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:24.350" style="s2">flowing on from that it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">hear you call it radical conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.350" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">because there&#39;s a few quotes that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">that I&#39;ve transcribed that from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">ideology logos and belief lecture which</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">I remember having a kind of hair stand</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">up on the back of my neck moment when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">heard you say this I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">happens to a person if they bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">themselves completely into alignment</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve had intimations of what that might</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">mean we don&#39;t understand the world very</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">well we don&#39;t understand her world could</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">be mastered if it was master completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how an individual might</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:53.570" style="s2">manage that we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">transformations that might make possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.570" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s mysticism rather than</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">religion is it not well I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">you can you could draw a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:04.829" style="s2">between those two things to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">because you could say that in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.829" end="00:02:09.720" style="s2">religious system there&#39;s two components</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">and people are temperamentally inclined</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">to align with one or the other there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">dogmatic component so the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:15.380" style="s2">are more</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">likely to align with that and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.380" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">active mystical component which updates</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">the conservative component but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">threatens it so which is what creative</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:29.130" style="s2">thought does in general and so I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:30.860" style="s2">say that the mystical element of that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.130" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">religious but it&#39;s more on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.860" end="00:02:37.380" style="s2">transformative side but you know I also</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">think that figures like the Buddha you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.380" end="00:02:43.050" style="s2">know he&#39;s an exemplar of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:45.209" style="s2">possibilities of that alignment and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.050" end="00:02:46.860" style="s2">exercise is the yogic exercises for</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.209" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">example our attempts to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.860" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">alignment into being you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">it&#39;s very centred on the body which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">quite interesting even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:56.069" style="s2">spiritual tradition right it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">centered on the body and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.069" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">that&#39;s related to the idea of the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">Christian idea and the Jewish idea for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:05.580" style="s2">that matter but the Christian idea more</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:07.319" style="s2">particularly of the sacredness of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.580" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">body and also the Christian insistence</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.319" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">that in the universal resurrection the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">body will also be resurrected right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:17.069" style="s2">not and you know people are cynical</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">about that idea but but there&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.069" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">know because they think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">simplistic and and archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">superstitious and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">they&#39;re missing the point the point is</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">that that system doesn&#39;t denigrate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">body it&#39;s as the body there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:36.090" style="s2">about the body that&#39;s integral to being</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">and cannot merely be disposed of and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">and so if there&#39;s a eternality to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">existence then it&#39;s an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">eternality and that&#39;s not especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">given what we know now about the manner</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:53.790" style="s2">in which mmm intelligence operates is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.840" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not really possible to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.790" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">disembodied being it&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:04.230" style="s2">really so yeah when you say you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:07.430" style="s2">intimations of what that might mean can</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.230" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">you explain what you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.430" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">well I&#39;ve had experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">everything came together you know and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">and and there are very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">experiences and and they&#39;re they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:25.169" style="s2">characterized by it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.680" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">turns into a musical symphony where each</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.169" end="00:04:30.090" style="s2">part is exact</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:31.860" style="s2">appropriate for that moment and and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.090" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">think music actually expresses that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.860" end="00:04:35.670" style="s2">which is partly why music produces</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:38.730" style="s2">transcendent experiences you know when</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:42.480" style="s2">people are dancing to something profound</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.730" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re really into it let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.480" end="00:04:46.920" style="s2">music and the person are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">and then if if things really get going</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.920" end="00:04:51.630" style="s2">you see this sometimes in a rock concert</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:04:55.710" style="s2">or a musical concert where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.630" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">in the same place right the band kicks</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.710" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">into high gear and they&#39;re way out</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:02.430" style="s2">beyond where they usually go you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:03.750" style="s2">see that that often in a concert even a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.430" end="00:05:06.420" style="s2">great concert but now and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.750" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">really see it and the whole place is one</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.420" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">thing that&#39;s just pulsing you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s an amazing experience and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">it is an intimation of paradise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:18.480" style="s2">something like that and you can think</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">about that psychologically you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.480" end="00:05:24.140" style="s2">because it also makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">psychologically that your optimal</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.140" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">experiences are going to occur when</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:31.560" style="s2">you&#39;re most United with yourself and but</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what see we don&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.560" end="00:05:34.980" style="s2">understand the relationship between our</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.330" end="00:05:37.530" style="s2">consciousness and the world the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.980" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">materialistic notion is that everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.530" end="00:05:43.770" style="s2">is deterministically causal essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:47.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a newtonian view it&#39;s also not true</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.770" end="00:05:51.240" style="s2">but we know that it&#39;s factually not true</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.790" end="00:05:55.230" style="s2">but apart from that or or it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.240" end="00:05:58.290" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say that exactly but at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.230" end="00:06:01.560" style="s2">very base of things determinism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.290" end="00:06:03.270" style="s2">the operative mechanism and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.560" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">things are too complex actually to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.270" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">strictly determined and it does look to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:12.570" style="s2">me like we negotiate through that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:15.200" style="s2">complexity but when we&#39;re at our best</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.570" end="00:06:17.760" style="s2">when we&#39;re integrated completely and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.200" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">there is an effect of that integration</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.760" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">in principle on what we would normally</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">regard as external reality because</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.610" end="00:06:28.650" style="s2">external reality can line up with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:31.260" style="s2">integration as well and so-called</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.650" end="00:06:33.030" style="s2">external reality and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.260" end="00:06:35.789" style="s2">probably experienced that when they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.030" end="00:06:37.410" style="s2">peak sexual experiences with someone you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.789" end="00:06:39.570" style="s2">know where there&#39;s real intimacy because</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.410" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same place at the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.570" end="00:06:41.909" style="s2">time and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">everything comes together for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.909" end="00:06:49.500" style="s2">moment you know maybe literally yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:52.969" style="s2">literally right and and and I also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.500" end="00:06:57.030" style="s2">think that that linguistic usage is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.969" end="00:07:00.889" style="s2">chance right because I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.030" end="00:07:04.740" style="s2">place where that experience is a brief</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.889" end="00:07:08.009" style="s2">intimation of of heaven that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:09.719" style="s2">way of thinking about it so well through</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.009" end="00:07:11.189" style="s2">listening to it started to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.719" end="00:07:12.780" style="s2">a lot of what I&#39;ve been doing over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.189" end="00:07:15.509" style="s2">last few years I&#39;ve done quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.780" end="00:07:17.370" style="s2">sort of deep transformational practices</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.509" end="00:07:19.889" style="s2">a lot of shadow works of integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.370" end="00:07:21.449" style="s2">shadow and actually feeling that real</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.889" end="00:07:23.819" style="s2">sense of becoming more in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.449" end="00:07:25.110" style="s2">myself feeling that these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.819" end="00:07:26.580" style="s2">parts of myself coming together and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.110" end="00:07:29.789" style="s2">feeling more embodied and more present</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.580" end="00:07:31.080" style="s2">in the world but it was through</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.789" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">listening to you that I made this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.080" end="00:07:34.620" style="s2">connection with the logos with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:36.479" style="s2">that this is actually a deep principle</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:40.860" style="s2">of Western culture which gave it another</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.479" end="00:07:43.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a real it&#39;s the Incarnation right</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.860" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">because the Incarnation is is as at</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.740" end="00:07:48.180" style="s2">least a symbolic representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:50.849" style="s2">idea that the Spirit has to fully</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.180" end="00:07:51.900" style="s2">inhabit the body right and that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.849" end="00:07:53.279" style="s2">remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.900" end="00:07:55.469" style="s2">it&#39;s a remarkable idea especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.279" end="00:07:58.740" style="s2">because the spirit so to speak the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.469" end="00:08:01.409" style="s2">psyche if you want flees from the body</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.740" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">in terror because the body is the place</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.409" end="00:08:06.629" style="s2">of mortality and suffering and so people</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:07.979" style="s2">are disembodied and it&#39;s because what</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.629" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">one way of looking at is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.979" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">too afraid to become fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:16.620" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re afraid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">reason to be afraid but the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.620" end="00:08:20.219" style="s2">well what would you be like if you had</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">the courage to be fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.219" end="00:08:23.909" style="s2">that&#39;s fully incarnate that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">way of thinking about that and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.909" end="00:08:28.620" style="s2">that Christian ideas that the fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">incarnate human being is the Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.620" end="00:08:35.849" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea that&#39;s a hell of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:38.039" style="s2">you know but it means embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.849" end="00:08:41.699" style="s2">horrors of the world that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.039" end="00:08:43.409" style="s2">means and that&#39;s not only the horrors of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.699" end="00:08:44.850" style="s2">the world but the evil of the world you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.409" end="00:08:48.630" style="s2">know so there&#39;s this idea that Christ</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.850" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">took absolutely well then those are</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.630" end="00:08:53.490" style="s2">those are not different and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that not only was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.490" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.880" end="00:08:58.440" style="s2">the incarnated spirit right so fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">descended into the body let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.440" end="00:09:02.750" style="s2">that he also took the sins of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.880" end="00:09:06.029" style="s2">onto himself and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.750" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">psychologically speaking is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.029" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">spiritual development is to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:16.230" style="s2">the satanic tendencies that characterize</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">you and to fully wrestle with them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.230" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">to and to integrate them that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">thing it&#39;s it&#39;s not so much to cast them</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">away it&#39;s to transmute them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">you can see the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:28.130" style="s2">people who&#39;ve done that and people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">haven&#39;t at least to some degree because</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.130" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t integrated the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:35.850" style="s2">at all are naive and you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.560" style="s2">when you look at them and you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.850" end="00:09:39.329" style="s2">that when you talk to them and because</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.560" end="00:09:41.009" style="s2">they&#39;re naive they&#39;re often resentful as</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.329" end="00:09:43.560" style="s2">well because they get taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.009" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">and someone who&#39;s integrated that more</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.560" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">they&#39;re dangerous in in the martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.730" style="s2">sort of way which is they&#39;re dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:54.259" style="s2">but they don&#39;t have to be they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.730" end="00:10:01.620" style="s2">have to use it because their presence</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.259" end="00:10:05.009" style="s2">radiates what would you say it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.620" end="00:10:07.649" style="s2">radiate threat exactly well certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.009" end="00:10:10.680" style="s2">strength but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.649" end="00:10:13.259" style="s2">potential for havoc that&#39;s the right way</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.680" end="00:10:15.630" style="s2">of thinking about it there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.259" end="00:10:19.170" style="s2">an implicit potential for havoc and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.630" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s really necessary it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.170" end="00:10:22.319" style="s2">things that gives people self respect</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:24.170" style="s2">this is an interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.319" end="00:10:27.449" style="s2">integration of the shadow because</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.170" end="00:10:31.829" style="s2">recognizing yourself as the locus of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.449" end="00:10:34.769" style="s2">evil let&#39;s say actually in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.829" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">gives you far more respect for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.769" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">strangely enough because the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">respect that you might have for a wild</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.910" end="00:10:43.110" style="s2">animal or even a monster it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:45.480" style="s2">though so then maybe you learn to treat</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.110" end="00:10:47.370" style="s2">yourself differently like I think this</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.480" end="00:10:49.560" style="s2">is particularly true with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.370" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">discipline of children you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.560" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">know that you&#39;re a monster and that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">will manifest itself in your life</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.870" end="00:10:59.069" style="s2">consciously or unconsciously and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:02.189" style="s2">unconsciously it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.069" end="00:11:03.930" style="s2">then you become better at disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.189" end="00:11:06.389" style="s2">children and the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.930" end="00:11:07.530" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to expose them to your</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.389" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">dark side</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.530" end="00:11:12.750" style="s2">and so if they behave and don&#39;t provoke</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">you which means they&#39;ll also behave for</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.750" end="00:11:17.940" style="s2">other people then you don&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:20.760" style="s2">monstrous part can stay in abeyance and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.940" end="00:11:23.250" style="s2">then that&#39;s great but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.760" end="00:11:24.660" style="s2">understand yourself as capable of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.250" end="00:11:26.790" style="s2">wreaking havoc and that can be the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.660" end="00:11:29.400" style="s2">of havoc that unfolds over decades right</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.790" end="00:11:32.070" style="s2">because if you&#39;re going to abuse a child</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.400" end="00:11:34.590" style="s2">it&#39;s the primitive form of abuses the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.070" end="00:11:36.780" style="s2">physical abuse the sophisticated form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.590" end="00:11:39.330" style="s2">abuse is the continual undermining of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.780" end="00:11:41.910" style="s2">the child&#39;s courage across perhaps their</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.330" end="00:11:44.550" style="s2">entire life and that there&#39;s a terribly</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.910" end="00:11:48.840" style="s2">monstrous element to that and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.550" end="00:11:52.290" style="s2">not respected properly by the child say</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.840" end="00:11:54.810" style="s2">you will absolutely take revenge on them</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.290" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s the holes in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.810" end="00:11:58.470" style="s2">sense that&#39;s the whole Freudian</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.170" style="s2">psychoanalytic story it&#39;s not all of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.470" end="00:12:03.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s a huge part of it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.170" end="00:12:06.120" style="s2">that you you say that you have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.960" end="00:12:08.250" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re dangerous or become</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">dangerous because I&#39;d also say that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.250" end="00:12:11.430" style="s2">you haven&#39;t done that kind of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:12.990" style="s2">work if you haven&#39;t made friends with</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.430" end="00:12:15.390" style="s2">your anger if you haven&#39;t integrated it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.990" end="00:12:17.220" style="s2">you&#39;re actually more dangerous yes then</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.390" end="00:12:18.660" style="s2">things will happen that will it will</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.220" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">come out in a way that you don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.660" end="00:12:23.430" style="s2">right it comes out disintegrated so it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:25.590" style="s2">comes out as an autonomous spirit right</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.430" end="00:12:28.350" style="s2">under no-one&#39;s control and that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.590" end="00:12:29.850" style="s2">burst of rage let&#39;s say you know when</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.350" end="00:12:31.410" style="s2">you when you hear about a mother who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.850" end="00:12:33.180" style="s2">done something terrible to one of her</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.410" end="00:12:36.600" style="s2">children it&#39;s that&#39;s the reason is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.180" end="00:12:39.300" style="s2">you know she maybe she&#39;s just been laid</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.600" end="00:12:40.140" style="s2">off maybe she went out and had two meant</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.690" end="00:13:06.150" style="s2">happened it&#39;s like well seven terrible</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">things came together at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.150" end="00:13:13.140" style="s2">and produced this outburst of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">disintegrated rage and like look the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.140" end="00:13:20.700" style="s2">hell out when that happens you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:22.500" style="s2">so yeah you you want to have that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.700" end="00:13:25.490" style="s2">you either have that or it has you those</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.500" end="00:13:29.160" style="s2">are the options and you don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.490" end="00:13:31.770" style="s2">safe by being castrated right that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:33.900" style="s2">the right move forward and it almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.770" end="00:13:36.530" style="s2">feels like having done that I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.900" end="00:13:38.610" style="s2">as a as a as a physiological thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.530" end="00:13:41.340" style="s2">there&#39;s more tools at my disposal</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:44.790" style="s2">it is a physiological thing I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.340" end="00:13:47.160" style="s2">can actually see a change in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">faces when that part of them is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">integrated when the I would say the rage</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:53.850" style="s2">circuit is integrated because their face</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:56.100" style="s2">is hardened like they no longer look</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.850" end="00:13:58.770" style="s2">like wide-eyed children that they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.100" end="00:14:01.500" style="s2">longer someone to who things only happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.770" end="00:14:03.480" style="s2">there there&#39;s someone who makes things</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.500" end="00:14:05.280" style="s2">happen and there isn&#39;t much difference</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.480" end="00:14:07.650" style="s2">between being dangerous and being</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.280" end="00:14:10.770" style="s2">indomitable right there.this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.650" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">that they&#39;re they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.770" end="00:14:15.300" style="s2">looked at from two different</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:17.640" style="s2">perspectives and so you know in my new</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.300" end="00:14:19.260" style="s2">book I wrote a little bit about there</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.640" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">was an idea in the 80s that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.260" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">reasonably popular among psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:26.490" style="s2">that the way to regulate male aggression</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:30.710" style="s2">was to socialise little boys like little</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.490" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">girls and that&#39;s a very very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.710" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">so because suppressing that aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:41.100" style="s2">competitive urge which also</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:43.830" style="s2">characterized as many women by the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.100" end="00:14:46.680" style="s2">although it&#39;s more common among men it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.830" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what you do you you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.680" end="00:14:51.030" style="s2">integrate it this is why I&#39;m such a fan</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.390" end="00:14:52.860" style="s2">of Piaget you know as opposed not as</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.030" end="00:14:54.990" style="s2">opposed to Freud but I think Piaget is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.860" end="00:14:57.330" style="s2">developmental model is superior to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.990" end="00:15:00.210" style="s2">Freud&#39;s developmental model because for</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.330" end="00:15:03.380" style="s2">Piaget the process of becoming civilized</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.210" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">is a process of continual integration</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.380" end="00:15:08.700" style="s2">including the integration of what Freud</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">would consider the in you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.700" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if for I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">because he wanted people to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:15.960" style="s2">the it but he you know he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">conceptualized socialization as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.960" end="00:15:20.400" style="s2">super-ego</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">inhibiting the it&#39;d you know or or</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.400" end="00:15:23.130" style="s2">suppressing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:26.040" style="s2">that&#39;s only that only happens when the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.130" end="00:15:28.590" style="s2">socialization process is bad when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.040" end="00:15:31.050" style="s2">good like if you have a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.590" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">child like my son was was and is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.050" end="00:15:37.080" style="s2">competitive person you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.230" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">have them integrate that into the ethos</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.080" end="00:15:41.850" style="s2">of fair play and then it&#39;s it&#39;s a mark</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">of character strength at that point</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.850" end="00:15:47.790" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s there&#39;s no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:51.660" style="s2">about it would you would you also say</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.790" end="00:15:54.960" style="s2">that that has to be balanced with</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.660" end="00:15:56.550" style="s2">compassion with a greatest of openness</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.960" end="00:16:01.590" style="s2">as well at the same time it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.550" end="00:16:06.330" style="s2">aimed right you need a name and and to</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.590" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">put your integrated capabilities to work</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.330" end="00:16:14.550" style="s2">at bringing everything together is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:16.620" style="s2">right aim and it&#39;s not a task for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.550" end="00:16:18.450" style="s2">know one of the things about I think and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.620" end="00:16:20.190" style="s2">one of the things about the way morality</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.450" end="00:16:23.730" style="s2">is taught is it&#39;s always taught like</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.190" end="00:16:25.950" style="s2">it&#39;s your it&#39;s your - it&#39;s always taught</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.730" end="00:16:27.330" style="s2">as if it&#39;s your grandma and of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.330" style="s2">that is too tight</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.330" end="00:16:32.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a hectoring sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.330" end="00:16:33.990" style="s2">that you should be good and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.400" end="00:16:36.090" style="s2">that you should be good is kind of for</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.990" end="00:16:37.590" style="s2">other people you know and then so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.090" end="00:16:38.910" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like the Freudian sense you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.590" end="00:16:41.340" style="s2">told to them yeah that&#39;s the super-ego</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.910" end="00:16:44.570" style="s2">sense exactly that&#39;s right and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.340" end="00:16:47.130" style="s2">a bunch of restrictions on you and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.570" end="00:16:50.370" style="s2">so you have to reduce yourself in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.130" end="00:16:52.050" style="s2">to be a good person and that&#39;s well you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.370" end="00:16:53.730" style="s2">might say that that&#39;s a prerequisite to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.050" end="00:16:55.950" style="s2">discipline because I think in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.730" end="00:16:57.990" style="s2">it is they know that you do have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.950" end="00:17:00.360" style="s2">molded and shaped you know Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.990" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">believed that a long period of unfreedom</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.360" end="00:17:04.460" style="s2">had to precede a period of freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:06.420" style="s2">that&#39;s something like discipline but</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.460" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">fundamentally that&#39;s not the proper</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.420" end="00:17:10.860" style="s2">orientation because making everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:13.560" style="s2">work better is actually the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.860" end="00:17:16.050" style="s2">demanding task that you can take on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.560" end="00:17:19.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not a matter of reducing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.050" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">to a domesticated moral being you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.140" end="00:17:25.860" style="s2">like like a well like a like a fat pug</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:28.920" style="s2">dog something like that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.860" end="00:17:30.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a task that takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.920" end="00:17:33.480" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve got and so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.750" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">can use all of those darker forces let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.480" end="00:17:41.730" style="s2">say to be indomitable as you move</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:46.020" style="s2">forward and and and you want a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.730" end="00:17:47.610" style="s2">because all of those forces are exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.020" end="00:17:51.030" style="s2">the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.610" end="00:17:53.880" style="s2">therefore the challenge and so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.030" end="00:17:55.500" style="s2">becomes a matter of well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.880" end="00:17:56.820" style="s2">conversion of something that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.500" end="00:18:01.559" style="s2">dark into something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.820" end="00:18:04.650" style="s2">prerequisite for for light so I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.559" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">thinking this on the plane the linking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.650" end="00:18:10.290" style="s2">to the the thing I said before about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:12.330" style="s2">connecting this this personal growth to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.290" end="00:18:16.440" style="s2">the idea of the logos was really</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.330" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">powerful and reframing this and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.440" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">heard you speak about this in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:22.320" style="s2">way as almost like a heroic mission you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.700" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">take on ultimate responsibility for your</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">words you take on responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">moving the world either closer or</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:31.650" style="s2">further from chaos that this is really</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:33.809" style="s2">you take on responsibility for moving</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.650" end="00:18:37.140" style="s2">the world closer to heaven or hell and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.809" end="00:18:39.179" style="s2">this I was thinking how powerful a</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.630" end="00:18:51.870" style="s2">or you&#39;re on the frontline fighting for</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.900" end="00:19:53.220" style="s2">long-term decision maybe for many of</p>

<p begin="00:21:03.480" end="00:21:08.790" style="s2">well what do you have otherwise you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:10.620" style="s2">you have a life of pleasure seeking you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.790" end="00:21:12.059" style="s2">there&#39;s no you have no admiration for</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.620" end="00:21:14.669" style="s2">yourself if you live a life like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.059" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s there&#39;s contempt their self</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.669" end="00:21:22.740" style="s2">contempt that&#39;s going to build and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:26.190" style="s2">or or engagement in things at a trivial</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.740" end="00:21:28.590" style="s2">level which isn&#39;t useful because in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.590" end="00:21:33.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not trivial the suffering makes it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.900" end="00:21:36.780" style="s2">not trivial as a baseline you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.480" end="00:21:39.540" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck with a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.780" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">profound experiences and all of them can</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.540" end="00:21:45.809" style="s2">be negative if you don&#39;t all of them can</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.950" end="00:21:48.690" style="s2">be negative if you let the default</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.809" end="00:21:50.580" style="s2">manifest itself but you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.690" end="00:21:52.620" style="s2">trivial because you have to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.580" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">your own death and the death of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.620" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">around you and and the horrors of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:22:02.160" style="s2">world and so there&#39;s no trivial response</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:05.580" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t subject you to that with no</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.160" end="00:22:09.179" style="s2">defense and then embittered you so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.580" end="00:22:13.650" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a call to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.179" end="00:22:14.850" style="s2">nobility in the in the idea of imitation</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.650" end="00:22:16.230" style="s2">of the logos but</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.850" end="00:22:20.790" style="s2">it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s a call to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.230" end="00:22:22.290" style="s2">something of well the hypothesis is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.790" end="00:22:24.270" style="s2">a call to something of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.290" end="00:22:27.960" style="s2">significance and I don&#39;t think that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.270" end="00:22:30.600" style="s2">have any right to assume that that idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.960" end="00:22:32.850" style="s2">is wrong we don&#39;t understand our place</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.600" end="00:22:36.450" style="s2">in the cosmos and you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.850" end="00:22:39.980" style="s2">base your analysis on size physical size</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.450" end="00:22:43.590" style="s2">well there are bigger things than us but</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.980" end="00:22:46.740" style="s2">it&#39;s not-- that&#39;s no that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.590" end="00:22:49.920" style="s2">reasonable yardstick there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.740" end="00:22:54.090" style="s2">anything that&#39;s more complex than us not</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.920" end="00:22:57.090" style="s2">not that we know of so why not use that</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.090" end="00:23:00.870" style="s2">as it as a marker and and there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.090" end="00:23:02.700" style="s2">something there&#39;s an integral</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.870" end="00:23:06.090" style="s2">relationship between consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.700" end="00:23:08.820" style="s2">being and that isn&#39;t taken with</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.090" end="00:23:11.610" style="s2">sufficient seriousness by by the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.820" end="00:23:13.650" style="s2">materialist community they keep like</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.610" end="00:23:15.570" style="s2">people like Daniel Dennett for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.650" end="00:23:17.730" style="s2">and you know he wrote a book on</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.570" end="00:23:19.800" style="s2">consciousness which his critics it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.730" end="00:23:21.990" style="s2">called explaining consciousness and his</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.800" end="00:23:25.560" style="s2">critics called it explaining</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.990" end="00:23:27.210" style="s2">consciousness away and I book and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.560" end="00:23:29.580" style="s2">is what he did as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.210" end="00:23:32.190" style="s2">and you know people like Sam Harris have</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.580" end="00:23:34.740" style="s2">a real hard time with freewill and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.190" end="00:23:37.170" style="s2">their proclivity is to deny it but they</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.740" end="00:23:39.450" style="s2">act out the proposition that people have</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.170" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">freewill including themselves because</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.450" end="00:23:43.410" style="s2">otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be able to exist</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.000" style="s2">in society because people aren&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.410" end="00:23:48.900" style="s2">happy when you treat them like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.000" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">not at least semi autonomous ages and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.900" end="00:23:56.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s fluke I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:58.020" style="s2">that we are semi autonomous agents now</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.580" end="00:24:00.930" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand how that can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.020" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">possible but I&#39;m not willing to say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.930" end="00:24:03.630" style="s2">it isn&#39;t the case merely because I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:06.860" style="s2">explain it</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.630" end="00:24:10.940" style="s2">especially when I observe that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.860" end="00:24:15.330" style="s2">accept it behaviorally as an axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.940" end="00:24:17.130" style="s2">proposition so they accept it as true it</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.330" end="00:24:18.930" style="s2">can say they don&#39;t believe it but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.130" end="00:24:20.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter well it depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.930" end="00:24:23.850" style="s2">you think you mean when you say believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.790" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">then for me you act out what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.850" end="00:24:28.060" style="s2">you know and your your conscious your</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:30.790" style="s2">your</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.830" end="00:25:07.300" style="s2">ourselves but but well UK it isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:09.640" style="s2">straightforward to determine what our</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.300" end="00:25:11.530" style="s2">place is in the in the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.640" end="00:25:13.900" style="s2">thing that really got me with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.530" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the good that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.900" end="00:25:20.110" style="s2">but the harm that we can do because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:21.940" style="s2">can debate about the good we can do but</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.110" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">you cannot debate about the arm we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.940" end="00:25:29.740" style="s2">do that&#39;s done we know if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:31.810" style="s2">know and I think my experience was when</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.740" end="00:25:35.680" style="s2">I took that seriously</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.810" end="00:25:38.200" style="s2">which meant understanding how that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.680" end="00:25:41.340" style="s2">about me you know about that arch which</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.200" end="00:25:46.530" style="s2">was about me and that the Stalinist</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.340" end="00:25:50.110" style="s2">camps were about me then while that</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.110" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">shadow idea right I mean and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.340" end="00:25:58.120" style="s2">that is part of the idea of taking the</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.120" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">like you&#39;re a human being so you see</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:11.080" style="s2">might say well I&#39;d never do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.310" end="00:26:13.330" style="s2">like don&#39;t be so sure about that</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.080" end="00:26:16.530" style="s2">in fact you&#39;re the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.330" end="00:26:19.680" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong is extraordinarily high</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.530" end="00:26:22.330" style="s2">well that&#39;s yes and I mean it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.680" end="00:26:25.780" style="s2">self-evident that the default position</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.410" end="00:26:35.260" style="s2">highly probable that you would be on the</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.860" end="00:30:01.910" style="s2">that is there&#39;s something better and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.660" end="00:30:06.290" style="s2">that&#39;s wisdom there is something better</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.910" end="00:30:09.890" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason not to go for what</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.290" end="00:30:11.540" style="s2">is the best what else you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.540" end="00:30:17.060" style="s2">definition right so why not work for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.870" end="00:30:19.220" style="s2">betterment of being and abandon your</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.060" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">resentment and your hatred of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.220" end="00:30:25.580" style="s2">and your self contempt and and take on</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.580" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">and catastrophes of of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:38.780" style="s2">and do what you can to well at least not</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:41.570" style="s2">make it worse but maybe to make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.780" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">better you know you can you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.570" end="00:30:47.960" style="s2">make it worse and better you just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:50.600" style="s2">know how much find out it might be way</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.960" end="00:30:53.530" style="s2">more than you think I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.600" end="00:30:56.660" style="s2">case so there isn&#39;t any more an</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.530" end="00:30:59.030" style="s2">interesting adventure than that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.660" end="00:31:02.900" style="s2">find out how much good you can do in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.030" end="00:31:07.549" style="s2">world and not in it and not in this</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.549" end="00:31:17.779" style="s2">but in a forthright noble courageous</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.779" end="00:31:27.049" style="s2">manner and then god only knows where we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.460" end="00:31:29.659" style="s2">could get so let&#39;s say let&#39;s find out</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.049" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">that would be good it&#39;s certainly better</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.659" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">than the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.230" end="00:31:46.039" style="s2">don&#39;t if you saw the logo that we&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.029" end="00:31:49.260" style="s2">together forever wisdom and recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.039" end="00:31:51.990" style="s2">the eye and yep in the triangle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.260" end="00:31:52.919" style="s2">perfect we were looking for an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.990" end="00:31:55.139" style="s2">kind of way that didn&#39;t look too</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.919" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">Illuminati mm-hmm there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.139" end="00:31:59.340" style="s2">Illuminati but not quite right so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:03.389" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s the thing is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:07.139" style="s2">the it&#39;s the Sun in the pyramid that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.389" end="00:32:10.220" style="s2">worship not the pyramid right because</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.139" end="00:32:17.330" style="s2">the Sun is the thing that in both senses</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.220" end="00:32:19.529" style="s2">that stops it from being the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.330" end="00:32:21.899" style="s2">so that&#39;s the thing that you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.529" end="00:32:24.299" style="s2">relationship with that it transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.899" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">dominance hierarchy so yeah it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.299" end="00:32:29.580" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it like in the Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:31.380" style="s2">that there&#39;s that little bird Zazu well</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.580" end="00:32:33.299" style="s2">he flies above everything sees</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.380" end="00:32:35.850" style="s2">everything that&#39;s the eye that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.299" end="00:32:37.860" style="s2">Egyptian eye it&#39;s outside the structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.850" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that moves up and down</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.860" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">the structure and it repairs it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">what consciousness does in your body</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it moves up and down levels of of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:51.330" style="s2">reality let&#39;s say and and alters them so</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.889" style="s2">in its so it&#39;s outside the structure and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.330" end="00:32:55.049" style="s2">it&#39;s also the thing that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.889" end="00:32:56.850" style="s2">the structure but the structure also</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.049" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">gives rise to it that&#39;s why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.850" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">Trinitarian ideas in Christianity you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:02.970" style="s2">know there&#39;s the father and the son and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:03.779" style="s2">they&#39;re mutually causal think well how</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.970" end="00:33:05.870" style="s2">can that be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.779" end="00:33:09.659" style="s2">well the son gives birth to the father</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.870" end="00:33:11.429" style="s2">obviously because boys turn into men but</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.659" end="00:33:14.070" style="s2">the father also gives birth to the son</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.429" end="00:33:19.399" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.070" end="00:33:19.399" style="s2">those Trinitarian ideas exist so</p>
