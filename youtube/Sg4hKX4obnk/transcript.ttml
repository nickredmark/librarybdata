<p begin="00:00:10.639" end="00:00:13.840" style="s2">welcome to the dark horse podcast live</p>

<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:17.199" style="s2">i believe this is our 36th is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.400" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">correct that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.199" end="00:00:20.320" style="s2">36. that&#39;s hard to imagine i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">yeah it is hard to say harder that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.480" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">try it at home you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:27.439" style="s2">um i&#39;m sitting with dr heather heing as</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">always and we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.439" end="00:00:30.560" style="s2">as always too much to discuss for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">allotted time</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.560" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">on account of it being 2020 and things</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">just keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">happening do they ever it&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.079" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">almost too much to keep up with</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:44.559" style="s2">um of course a lot going on uh today</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:46.960" style="s2">and we will get to it in due course</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.559" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">where shall we start you wanted to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.960" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">summary of the three big ideas that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">uh have been talking about in the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">couple of live streams and bring them</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">all together just to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">remind us at the top of the hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:01:01.840" style="s2">verificationism autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">and group psychosis right so these are</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.840" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">three concepts that i believe</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">are at least very useful if not</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:11.439" style="s2">in cobbling together a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.439" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">in this moment where our sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">becoming increasingly deranged and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:18.560" style="s2">fact the model</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">in part explains why sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">so deranged so i&#39;m actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">start with autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:29.360" style="s2">autoimmunity is a process by which</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">the body which is supposed to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.360" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">an absolute distinction</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">between molecules that you yourself make</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">and molecules that you yourself do not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">make and therefore if they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">organic molecules the body assumes are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">hostile and it attacks them with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">immune system</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">so that system develops when you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">your system recognizes every molecule</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:53.360" style="s2">yourself are producing and it eliminates</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">the cells in your immune system that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.360" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">react to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">leaving only cells that react to other</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">so this is a an analogy for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">situation that we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">where we see many in our midst attacking</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">the very structures on which our system</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">depends</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">and they are attacking them with various</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">rationalizations claiming that these</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">structures are</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">so broken that they could not possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">be rescued but the result is just like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">body that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">rejecting its own tissue that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:26.360" style="s2">putting ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">mortal jeopardy as a result of this uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.360" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">misunderstanding i would also just as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">aside</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.760" style="s2">point out that many of the food</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">sensitivities that some of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.760" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">have i have a very severe sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">wheat that these things are like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">except instead of reacting to your own</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">tissues you&#39;re reacting to foods</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">that you yourself consume so something</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">has caused me for example to become</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">reactive to wheat molecules when i eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">them my immune system reacts and i get</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">as a result not of the wheat but as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">result of my reaction to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">so autoimmunity is a key concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">the second key concept for sense making</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">in this moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">is verificationism so verificationism is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">a process whereby instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">find reasons to disbelieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">some hypothesis you look for reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">believe it</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">and the problem with verificationism is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:23.200" style="s2">can often find some evidence for a wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">idea and therefore if you are looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">for evidence that confirms a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">you will very often validate it even</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">though it is false</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">whereas if you try to falsify a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">and you fail that means there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">strong evidence against it and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">hypothesis probably has a good</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">degree of truth in it so the claim is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">that most of what people are doing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">they are trying to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">world at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">involves verificationism that they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">a perspective and they are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">things that validate it and they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">finding a tremendous amount of support</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">for wrong ideas on the basis that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">are looking only for those things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">support them rather than things</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">that negate them which results in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">what we are arguing is group psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">that psychosis is essentially the result</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">of incompatible programs running</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">simultaneously that one one cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">two things or cannot find a mechanism to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">compartmentalize them and keep them</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">what happens is the programs keep</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">tripping over each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">and so one ends up responding to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">a view of reality that is um</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">false and disruptive of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">to function properly so much of what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">is the result for example of two</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">both of which are wrong being</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">deployed to different populations who</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">find each other increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">understandable</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">these incompatibilities are resulting in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">us at some level</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">literally becoming crazy some of us as</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">but all of us as part of this group that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">cannot figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">even in what language to approach each</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">other to discuss what we face and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">overwhelmingly common interests clearly</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">are we can&#39;t figure out how to protect</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">them because</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">the incompatibilities between these</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">world views</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">are too great the gap is too big for us</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">to look past it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">yeah in the language of sense making we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">literally do not find any sense in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">who are on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">we do not find any sense and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">increasingly we regard them as some</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">phenomenon right in fact i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">outgrowths of a psychotic collective</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">is the verificationist belief that in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">fact you&#39;ve got it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">and the other side is simply insane and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">if one can for a moment just step out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">sense-making bubble and realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">likelihood of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">is actually quite small right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">certainly possible for a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">to be simply insane but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">half the population has simply lost its</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">mind while you have retained a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">grasp of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">is indeed quite unlikely so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">the trick the thing which actually i</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">swear if you&#39;ll try it you&#39;ll find it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">rewarding and maybe even reassuring but</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">the trick is to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">who you can talk to in that group of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">people who you probably regard</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">as batshit crazy who might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">convey to you where to stand in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">see through their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">now many on your own side will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">don&#39;t you dare</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">right to the extent that you even humor</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">them as if they are making some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">point you are putting</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">the thing that we must do right away in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">and you must ignore that if your purpose</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">is to figure out what&#39;s going on rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">than just to simply participate on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">no matter how dangerous its viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">has become then it is necessary that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">to understand what those on the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.479" style="s2">side are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">seeing all right so that&#39;s the model and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.479" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">indeed i think you will see in many of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">the things that we discussed today that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">these uh ways these concepts that help</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">organize</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">um our thinking around the way events</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">are unfolding in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">many of them are manifest in these other</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">topics or seemingly unrelated topics</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">well to your final point there i would</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">say that we hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">a lot from people who say they are right</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">of center uh who say they</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">enjoy hearing what we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">because we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">trying to make sense rather than simply</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">indoctrinate and there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">ways that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">little little sound bite can sound but</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">um that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">are coming to us despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">we probably have never voted the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">way they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">or would disagree on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">methods by which we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">obtain a just world</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">but that so long as we do share</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">underlying values which the vast</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">majority of us do</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">um that people are heartened</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">conservatives good faith conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">are heartened to hear us</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">as good faith liberals doing this kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">and one of the things that is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">disheartening and i think we may um i</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">mean i guess we could start here but i</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">just briefly at some point today about</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on in louisville and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">the response to it i mean maybe that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">the right way</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">i thought we would finish there but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">should we maybe start there well i want</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">uh follow on two things maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.879" style="s2">come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">one is uh in somewhere in i think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.879" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">must have been at the end of last week i</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">happened to catch a tucker carlson</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">monologue</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">in which he specifically alerted his</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">audience he</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">called out honorable liberals who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">horrified by what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">on the nominal left at the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">his exact phrase was something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">you know honorable liberals are</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">horrified too</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">they exist you know right and he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.440" style="s2">calling out the very fact that it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">to misunderstand that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.440" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">such a person on the other side might</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">exist and he is uh you know i felt a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">little bit that he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">uh winking at us and some of uh our idw</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">friends who have managed to make uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">higher quality sense in these</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">confusing moments but the other thing we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:12.320" style="s2">get is the flip side</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">um which you called out in an early live</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">uh which was the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">of trump derangement syndrome yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">and so the mirror image of trump dramir</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">image of trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">which we often hear</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">too when we critique trump when we say</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">things like really he must be</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">removed from office right we must vote</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">him out</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel like i&#39;m saying anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">extraordinary in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">a democracy right the idea that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">sitting president has</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">demonstrated that they must be</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">eliminated in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">the next round of elections is par for</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">the course and yet we are frequently</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">accused</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">of being just simply blinded by our</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">hatred for trump and i must say</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t actually feel hatred i feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">urgency</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">right i feel like it&#39;s that critique is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">dumb as the response uh to trump</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">that he cannot do anything right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">therefore anything that comes out of his</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">mouth must be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">that is exactly as dumb frankly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">exactly as uh as</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">dangerous uh response you know every</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">person in any position</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">must be critiquable and uh ascribing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">someone who critiques</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">someone else uh a a you know derangement</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">syndrome as a way to get rid of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">uh is you know it&#39;s schoolyard tactics</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the antics of a third grader</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">really well so i want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">the the key question is can you escape</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">it whatever it is that drives you to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">and i feel a lot of people are just</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">being reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">and that the necessity at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">really the only hope i</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">see for us navigating this moment in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">history and coming out</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">in any sort of decent shape whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">the ability to look past the triggers</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">that other people have on their surface</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">in order to be able to partner with</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">others who</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">are overwhelmingly in agreement about</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">values and so this is this is what</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">annoyed me so much about the harper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">letter was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">it took great pains to stick a finger in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">the eye of conservatives rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">partnering with the conservatives who</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">are clearly ready to play and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">um so anyway we need to stop being so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">triggered</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">people who uh believe something that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">incompatible with your worldview may</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">be many things that are compatible and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">finding the way to bridge those</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">gaps is uh it is essential it is where</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">where hope exists and hence hence the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">resonance of the concept of unity at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">so to uh to this point and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">we should spend much time here because</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">we have so many other things we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">um it has been it has been reported</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.160" style="s2">described as mafia tactics</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">shakedown requests from the local black</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">and uh yeah they they were requiring</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">things like x percent of the purchases</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">be made from black owned businesses</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:52.720" style="s2">and x percent of the employees be black</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">to reflect uh the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.720" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">demographics of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">of louisville and you know this this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">sort of as we have come to expect at</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">least the two of us and many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">many people watching from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">uh we would like to think the fringe</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">parts of the black lives matter movement</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">of course this these sorts of things are</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">described and to some degree celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">on the block on the official black lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">matter website</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">so once again black lives matter is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">what it seems just because it&#39;s wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">up in a bow with words that sound like</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">words we all should and need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">to get behind</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it is what it claims</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">to be so the courier journal reported</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">and uh fox picked it up</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">and uh used you know added a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">of reporting but mostly i think just</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">uh picked up picked up the story so i</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve been looking at this story for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">couple days here&#39;s the uh</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">a public health crisis so nothing there</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">wapo the washington post um sorry my</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">it has nothing to do with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">news that is coming out of louisville</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">uh here we have msnbc similarly</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">absolutely nothing about this story and</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">i figure you could do this for almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">all of these stories and this was simple</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">because there was a city</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">where there have been protests there has</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">been action there has been reporting of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">late</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">let&#39;s see if as soon as the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">switches</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">we get any play at all and apparently</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">the answer is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">so um i want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">take a little victory lap here for idw</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">style sense making because the story</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">reflects a pattern and i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">actually some of the uh demands were</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">even more onerous than the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">that you reported yeah actually i might</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">don&#39;t switch to my thing here but um</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">you know uh non-profits in the newly</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">district will submit to a voluntary</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">non-profit leaders um</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">yeah and oh dr dress code policies if</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">the claim is dress code</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">policies inherently discriminate against</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">black folks within the transgender</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">community you must eliminate dress code</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.199" style="s2">and we will not waiver while the black</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.199" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">so some of them um i would just like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">point out</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">you just went through a series of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">uh press outlets that failed to report</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">the story entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">um earliest uh prediction of such a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">thing i would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">is eric&#39;s coining of the term</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">intersectional shakedown</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">which goes back years yep</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">um i have argued that and of course his</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">gin</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">gated in institutional narrative both of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">those things right are resonant why</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">do you not see this because the gate has</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">closed and this narrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">um will not be breached by that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">inconvenient fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">i have said that this movement is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">interested in reparations</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">24 hours a day seven days a week 365</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">days a year</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">right this is beginning to be that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">have pointed</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">to the proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">of things like black lives matter signs</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">in store windows that you have called uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">don&#39;t hurt me displays and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">michael tracy who to the point about</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">bridging divides with people michael</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">tracy who has tangled with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">various people in the idw at various</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">points nonetheless put together</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">a report apparently where he goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">through he was on the ground here in</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">portland</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">and he released some very dramatic uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">video of him being</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">uh uh attacked by</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">uh antifa members but he apparently</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">shows what you and i know from being</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">downtown here in portland which is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">yes the protests were concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">around the federal buildings but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">extensive and there are many businesses</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">that effectively plea</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">not to be injured on the basis that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">black lives matter and so what this all</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">does is a it makes it impossible to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">how much organic support there actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">is because there&#39;s a whole hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">of inorganic support that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">recognize that whether it&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">of their personal reputations being</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">destroyed and their</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">livelihoods being wiped out or whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the businesses that they have built</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">and their ability to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">in place you know we&#39;ve seen years of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">this kind of nonsense where</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">you know women were attacked for uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">making burritos while not being mexican</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">and um so anyway the point is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">and this and this is all uh directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">predicted by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">hovel essay that i read from last time</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">exactly his green grocer his green</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">grocer who puts the sign in in his</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">window</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">um so if you&#39;re paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">mainstream sites</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">you will have no idea that this is even</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">going on you will not understand that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">your sense making is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">missing this very important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">information about what this movement is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">and so when you see people like us</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">troubled by the idea that this movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">partnering with the democratic party and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">what does that mean for the future of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:41.120" style="s2">the country</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll think we&#39;re overreacting right</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.120" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">because you&#39;ve been fed</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.640" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">a verificationist slate that will lead</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">you to believe that things aren&#39;t nearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">so troubling as they</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">actually are we are for instance to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">believe that now the feds are out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">portland everything&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">and of course what has happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">the uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">that the rioters have moved to the east</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">side of portland to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">a local police precinct where they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">making trouble there they&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">in front of the federal building</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">they have they&#39;ve moved their activities</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">so all those going to the federal</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">building and looking for confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">that it was the feds who were causing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">this can find that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">verificationism in action</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s like um willful blindness</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">using verificationism you will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">provided a set of evidence that is safe</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">for you to navigate and say i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">right and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">dangerous yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">um i guess one final point i would make</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">is something emerged</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">i believe yesterday body cam footage</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">from the george floyd arrest</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">and i must say back when i was on</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">uh joe rogan&#39;s program last when when</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">would that have been</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">june maybe july june july um somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">on the cusp of uh of the dawning of july</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">and i um one of the things i talked to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">him about</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">was that the age of aquarius i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">no that&#39;s a boomer thing i&#39;m not into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">anyway i talked to joe about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.240" style="s2">troubling</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">hints that the george floyd arrest was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.240" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">very complex thing that would require a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">court to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">the details which i still feel very</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">strange about saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">given what everybody seems to believe</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">about this arrest</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">in the intervening time a transcript</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">of the body cam footage emerged and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">read it as you did</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">and it is full of complexities that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">reflect yes the need to actually sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">what the police policy was what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">state of george floyd was</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">lots of things including that he uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">insisted he couldn&#39;t breathe before he</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">ever hit the ground that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">actually um requested to be put on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">ground that he refused to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">put in the in the vehicle but in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">case the body cam footage emerged</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">yesterday and it does reflect the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">complexity that requires</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">sorting this out in a court</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">but then today cnn</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">released an edit of that video which</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">seems to strongly suggest the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">alternative interpretation that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">everything is exactly as you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">told</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s just as dire as you think so are</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">you saying that was released yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">is unedited</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">that we have access that what was</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">released by the police department</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">presumably is unedited do we have reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">to believe that that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">i am saying that first of all i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:29.760" style="s2">sure what unedited it means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">obviously a start and a stop point and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.760" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">between the start and stop point are we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">seeing everything that was recorded</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">um that&#39;s a good question i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">know the answer to so an edit of an edit</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">is obviously devious but an edit of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">non-edit</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">is even is far more devious right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">here&#39;s what i would caution</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">our viewers i think you should see the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">and before you formulate a judgment on</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">what you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">you should look at all of it in context</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">if you assume</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">that cnn is presenting you with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">salient bits and you make</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">you formulate a judgment based on that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">think you will come out somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">very different than you would come out</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">if you just simply looked at whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">that the body cams recorded as they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">so um this</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">you know incredibly uncomfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">talk about this but the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">of what unfolds is substantial and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">you should not let anybody tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">it means</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">the answer is this does require a court</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">and in order to have a court</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">that functions properly it requires that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">citizens who sit in that court as</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">members of a jury</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">understand that they are entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">reason based on evidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">rather than based on the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">violence that clearly exists if the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">verdict does not go</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">the way the public expects and most of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">the public</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">hopes it goes so um anyway it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">caution</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">about verificationism and about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:58.799" style="s2">that the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">uh is inclined to deliver you something</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.799" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">that your verificationist mindset</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">is likely to accept and that this can</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">actually march us into</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">great danger uh of historical</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">proportions</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">okay should we move on to getting rid of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">history and math oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">please yeah those are irritating yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">all of us had some moments at least if</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:18.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">you know totally ridiculous classes so</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.880" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">let&#39;s just get rid of them yeah chalk on</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">the sleeves there&#39;s lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">that are very troubling about math yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">okay zach would you show my screen here</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">uh this is actually uh reported by nbc</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">chicago area leaders call for illinois</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">to abolish history classes</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">his state rep lashon k ford said that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:39.760" style="s2">current history teachings overlook the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">contributions of women and minorities</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.760" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">that may well be true but from that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">starting point</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">he then says third paragraph here before</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">ford asked the uh isboe and school</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">districts to immediately remove history</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">curriculum and books that quote</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">a suitable alternative is developed</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">he is asking for a change to the history</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">curriculum schools statewide and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">temporary halt</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">for all history instruction until an</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">alternative is decided upon</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">how is it that you think a new history</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">curriculum is going to be decided upon</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll bet this guy gets to make some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">those decisions and maybe he even gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">to populate the committee that makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">so zach you can you can take that down</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">now that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">at some level more of the same defund</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">stem you know defund history that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">does not use the word defund but</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">we do have uh an academic uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">rochelle gutierrez uh who suggests in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">tweet i&#39;m not gonna show it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">but i will just read uh from it that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">should defund math</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">she is saying um sorry let me</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">pull it up so that i can see it um</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">i think that we should be literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">defunding math from k-12</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">k-12 curriculum requirements and testing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">literally defunding math from society</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.720" style="s2">parentheses stem funding and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">salaries but also figuratively from our</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">minds parenthesis giving the current</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">version more value than other subjects</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">or gifts</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">so hat tip to james lindsay for bringing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">this to light</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">uh he is as always on top of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">um so i just i went and looked at who</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">this person is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">um she&#39;s she&#39;s tenured it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">one of the illinois state universities</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">um she has degrees in education not in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">math</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">but her profile makes it look because</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">she is</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">interested in curriculum reform of math</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">that she&#39;s she&#39;s somehow involved that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">she somehow has expertise in math</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:44.559" style="s2">maths education she doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">degrees in math</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.559" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">she has degrees in education so</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">we have pointed out you can just show</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">this super briefly brett this is their</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">this is her cb this is her curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">vitae which is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">uh fancy resume for academics so yeah</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">important school but it&#39;s a school ahead</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">she got her phd in education and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">curriculum and instruction</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">and she is um confusing</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">everyone who is listening to her into</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">thinking that someone who knows math</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">who does math who thinks in math thinks</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">also that we need to get math out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">k</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">12 curriculum we then she expands a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">little bit we need to get stem all of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">stem</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">science tech uh engineering and math out</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">salaries and like just basically start</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">defunding</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">people did but we talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">article in some depth back i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">know what episode</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">good to us it was compelling but what</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">was the big difference</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">between the new york subway in march</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">versus now</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">there were many many many more people</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">riding on it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">nowhere in the world is mass transit</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">does mass transit have the ridership</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">that it did pre-pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">so a it is difficult to do track and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">trace with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">subway ridership because most people</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">aren&#39;t tracing their own movements that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">and um and and it&#39;s just not being done</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">at that level</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">but even if it were even if the track</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">and trace data were fully reliable with</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">regard to subway ridership</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same we expect exactly for</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">transmission of this virus to track with</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">density of the virus being transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">as droplets and aerosols impact spaces</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">and because</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">ridership is way down of course right of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">course writing subways is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">safer which means</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">that this is actually uh a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">like journalistic medical malpractice</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">because the lead that they give is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">actually guys you&#39;d be a nervous</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">nellie&#39;s you&#39;re kind of scared you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">should you should probably get back on</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">your subways now</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">well you know what if everyone takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">their advice suddenly the subways are</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">gonna get a lot more dangerous again</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">because they&#39;re going to be densely</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">packed again so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">demonstrate this with the reducto ad</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">absurdum let&#39;s do it right at the point</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">that nobody is on the subway subways</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">become perfectly safe</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">try this rubric and you and would what</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">and you know and okay there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">economic imperative here right</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">subways need riders in order to to pay</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:19.440" style="s2">their bills</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">and you know across the board every</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.440" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">sector in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">there&#39;s probably a few that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.080" style="s2">growing right now but almost every</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:27.279" style="s2">sector in the economy is failing as a</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">to it and so presumably new york subway</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">probably heard that</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">that&#39;s even more people yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">anyway you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">that study was questionable newer better</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">and lo and behold you&#39;re right in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">subway again when in fact you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">need that study to tell you that the</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">right because what we know is that the</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">matches everything else we know right</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got the new york times</p>

<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">have probably never heard it in those in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">those terms i mean everyone has actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">an intuitive understanding of what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">means like you all everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">that if they&#39;re trying to do their</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">grocery shopping quickly they should go</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">likely to be fewer people in the store</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">rather than more right that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">density dependent so everyone knows that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">and probably everyone who remembers any</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">of their like high school biology will</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">betsy and mimicry right in which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">got a toxic</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">model organism that&#39;s just the language</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">of biology a toxic model</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">um which is out there paying the price</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">of having both</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">um the coloration to worn predators and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">also the toxicity that will be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">punishment for predators should they</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">should they tangle with the model and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:55.280" style="s2">then you have a mimic species</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">um that is that looks like the model and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">so pays the price of having to build</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">those colors and such</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t have the toxin which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">itself a big metabolic cost like toxins</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">are expensive to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">to make and to maintain and to carry</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">around and so the mimic</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">um it can be really really successful we</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">have like king snakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">mimicking coral snakes for instance and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">you know there are many examples of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">we could we could spend hours talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">about this as we as we have in the past</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">um but for now let&#39;s just say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">probably when you learn this</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">in high school biology or even college</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">um you weren&#39;t taught that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">that strategy isn&#39;t simply good that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">depends on the mimic being rare relative</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">to the model</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">because if predators are out there</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">for food and they take a little taste</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">before they&#39;re old enough to know or</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">because they you know they&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">species where they aren&#39;t taught by</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">their moms what to eat</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">they take a little taste first of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">brightly colored species</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">that happens to be the non-toxic one</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">then they&#39;re going to extrapolate that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">they&#39;re all non-toxic and so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">non-toxic mimics need to be rare</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">relative to the toxic models in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">for this to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">that is density dependence and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">guess what being safe on the subway</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">right we&#39;re not we wouldn&#39;t be safer</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">right now wearing masks because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">lived together and have been in</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">a mask it will make you safer because</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">the density of viral particles that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">are likely to run into</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">is higher so looting also fits a density</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">dependent model yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">you know looting when there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">else looting and you will find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">under arrest if you do it when everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">else is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s perfect yeah so anyway there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">of places where this concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">uh is useful and um yes it is totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">abused here in order to create a false</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">story i would point out also i believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">it was an mit study</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">that did the original work on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">subways and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">one of the things that was really good</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">about it was it wasn&#39;t just like well</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">the data suggests it was subways</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">it actually drew a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:24.240" style="s2">local trains and express trains that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">fit the model and the model was the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.240" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">local trains are actually more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">because you spend more time on them</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">which actually matches what we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">about the way this virus transmits i</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">think well</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">i think it was impossible to know why</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">they were more dangerous and i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">there were two hypotheses both of which</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">seem right</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">right so it&#39;s you spend more time on</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">them if you&#39;re going from point a to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">point d and you don&#39;t stop at b and c</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">you spend less time on an express</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">but but more people are going on and off</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">and therefore there&#39;s more opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">for transmission because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">greater chance that someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">infected has gotten on</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re not mutually exclusive right</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">you get into a box and people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">exhaling virus if they have it into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">box and the box retains it even when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">person gets off</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">and more people are getting onto that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">box and you&#39;re in contact with that air</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">for longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get more virus so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">point is it wasn&#39;t even like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if that methodology was</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">any good the fact that that methodology</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not that subways are dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">express trains are better local trains</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">are worse</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">that actually gives you a model for</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">transmission so this is high quality</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">work not low quality work</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">yes and for the new york times to take</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">up arms against it actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">matches what eric delivered in his most</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">recent intro essay</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">to his most recent portal podcast in</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">which he</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">builds a model one of the manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">of which is the headline is the story</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">right this is about optics and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">is what are you supposed to take away</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">from this</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">subways are safer than you think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">what happens don&#39;t be scared</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">you might get coveted you might give it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">to somebody who&#39;s gonna die you might</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:51.119" style="s2">end up</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">facing much longer term harms than you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">otherwise uh would and so you know this</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">directly putting people in danger and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">um if you&#39;re a devotee of the new york</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">times you won&#39;t know any better that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.119" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">right and i think it&#39;s also related to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">culture that i&#39;ve been commenting on for</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">uh which is that it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">widely considered in the intelligentsia</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.839" style="s2">you know at like high-end cocktail</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:16.079" style="s2">parties and the likes um</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.839" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">to be cool it&#39;s like cool or funny to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">enumerate</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">right to be like oh i suck at math or i</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">never did well in math</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:23.599" style="s2">whereas obviously in the same circles if</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:26.000" style="s2">you admitted that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.599" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">you were illiterate you would not be</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.000" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">invited anymore right this this wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">be acceptable and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">you know the one sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">partial carving out is you know people</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">who are dyslexic</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">can say like actually i really struggle</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">with that thing and you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">you&#39;re still forced to jump through</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">different and some of the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">hoops in order to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">that you can do everything that us like</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">sort of fully literate folk are doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">and yet us fully numerate folk are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:54.800" style="s2">even allowed to celebrate the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">we actually have a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.800" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">of understanding the world that is guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">what guys better</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">than the way that the enumerate folks</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">the the numerate people have of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:05.440" style="s2">understanding the world it is at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">an enumerate way of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">world that allows for things like</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">density dependent transmission of viral</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">particles</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">will keep you alive for longer and safer</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">for longer than an enumerate way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">viewing the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s better that&#39;s what better</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">means so better means</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">multiple things right that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">things that better ends though</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">it also means testable reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">and so to both these issues here</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">um if we can step back to the question</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">of getting rid of history right getting</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">rid of history is clearly in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">myth making which will fit some</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">narrative but</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">in order to fit a narrative rather than</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">fit what actually took place you have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">eliminate the possibility that a method</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">will tell you no that didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">so witness the 1619 project</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">right it is at best well-intentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">myth-making that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">overwrite</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">history so that we don&#39;t have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">with its um</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">complexities but i think that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">generous interpretation possible</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">that&#39;s why i said best yep um but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">let&#39;s look at this um this math educator</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">attacking math this is autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">system which knows how to think</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">quantitatively</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">attacking its ability to uh act</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">quantitatively and look</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing everywhere you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">got things that want</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">power for which the thing that stands in</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">like reality and the ability to detect</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:31.520" style="s2">it and quantify it</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">want to get rid of math that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.520" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">surprising if you want to re-uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">arrange well-being if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">redistribute it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">and what stands in your way is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">that history doesn&#39;t reflect the story</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">that justifies</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">the redistribution right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">murkier than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">then you go after history and the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">is well we can just overwrite that with</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">something that does work</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">and what do you do if you want power and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">the thing that stops you from taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">power over restaurant owners</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">is the police who show up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">you know arrest you for trying to extort</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">uh shop owners</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">well what do you do you demand the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">abolition of the police</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s attacking all of the structures</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">that make civilization work on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">that that gives somebody the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">do something they can&#39;t otherwise do</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">that we should absolutely be horrified</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">that they want to do yeah we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">know what happened in history</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">we need to be able to quantify things be</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">be able to establish the</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">true that&#39;s not there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">navigate you won&#39;t get very far you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll destroy yourself yep and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:38.319" style="s2">i want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">uh just briefly to this point about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.319" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">mathematical understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">even your daily life is just a superior</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">one to an</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">an a mathematical and certainly to an</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">uh i want to make it clear that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">am totally recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">most math education sucks so badly that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">most people who are enumerate now</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">are not enumerate um through i won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">any fault of their own necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">many many people have been just betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">by an educational system that took their</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">mathematical their native mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">thinking away from them</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s not fair that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">egregious that was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">you know massive failure of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">education if that happened to you and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">assume that it happened probably to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">majority of people watching even this</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">while uh we know that we have engineers</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">and scientists and such</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">among our viewers unless you have gone</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">into a science</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">and have continued to explicitly think</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">about math in your daily life</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">most people imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.599" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t use it they lost it</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">or worse yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:46.720" style="s2">they never had it at all because their</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">math teachers were terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.720" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">they didn&#39;t understand math themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">they used carrot and stick regimes to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">motivate rather than oh my god this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">fun look at how much more empowered you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">in your own world and in the universe if</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">you just have</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">a few basic understandings of how math</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">and can employ those you know use them</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">and put them in your tool kit and use</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">them when they need to be used so</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">um one of the one of the reasons at this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">point about math is going to be harder</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">to make i think is because</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">most most smart people even most smart</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">people who were paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">to this and who are sort of anti-woke</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">and really alarmed about what is going</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">right now in american society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">spreading across the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">um know themselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">a bit enumerate know themselves to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">bit scared of math and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">may not want to speak up for fear of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">someone going oh yeah you know prove you</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">can do math</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t need lots of people who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">currently think mathematically to prove</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">it and you shouldn&#39;t be bullied</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">into accepting that you need to prove it</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">what you should</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">be is actually angry that this happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">to you if it did happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">and uh and be willing to learn your</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">concept like density dependence now</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">and you know we could do a more complete</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">job of it but now you&#39;ve got it and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">you know that actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">going on the subway is safe is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">incomplete rule that is inherently going</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">to be wrong at least sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">therefore you shouldn&#39;t put that in your</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">in your quiver like that is not one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">the rules that you should be remembering</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">you should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">density dependence of viral particles is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">is what i should be considering</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">as i decide whether or not i should go</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">into that situation at all and if i am</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">in that situation whether i should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:28.240" style="s2">masked</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">et cetera i should also say much like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.240" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">the situation</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">with uh the police</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be said for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">that our math education mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">exactly as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:41.920" style="s2">suggesting here is broken enough to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">disrupt most people&#39;s acquisition of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.920" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">stuff they need</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">and that we have tools at our disposal</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">that our ancestors did not</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">right so you know when a chalkboard was</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">your mechanism for conveying math you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">limited in a sense but we have all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">of tools that we could be leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">much more effectively you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">gamify the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">acquisition of math so that it did not</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">feel like medicine that it felt like</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">fun and were we to do that my father did</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">exactly and but here&#39;s the key why was</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">your father able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">because he deeply understood math right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">most of the people teaching math do not</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">deeply understand math at best they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">competent at it yeah and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">our whole mechanism for education</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">suffers from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">that we don&#39;t budget to get the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">liable to be insightful into the field</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">in order to teach children and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">pennywise pound foolish because</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">literate population how many more things</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">would we invent</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">how much more likely would we be to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">be able to overcome this nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">narrative manufacture because people</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">would be able to detect the flaws</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">in what they were reading so you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">the cost we are paying</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">for not bringing the imaginative really</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:58.160" style="s2">high quality mathematical minds into</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">teaching young people how to think about</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">is uh it&#39;s a giant loss and um</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:06.240" style="s2">if you know we have immediate problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">but if we get past the immediate</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">addressing that would be really high on</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">absolutely priorities because most the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">way that math is taught is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">often terrible and much of what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">taught</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">is um the wrong stuff right like i i</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">having now now being familiar with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">of the topics that are in the k12 math</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">curriculum because our kids</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:31.040" style="s2">have been through it and are you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">advancing through it now um</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.040" end="00:48:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that a lot of it is just oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">well this is this is in the textbook</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.720" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">that we&#39;ve always used and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">going to force you to walk through this</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:41.280" style="s2">and you know both of our kids happen to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">have fun with math and i get to do with</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.280" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">them some of the same stuff my dad did</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">with me and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">helping them out but but i still run</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">into stuff i&#39;m like god i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">care like i just don&#39;t think this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">this is going to come up you know it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">will come up</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">in a very particular place but math is</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">everywhere let&#39;s be teaching math</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">that reveals itself as everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">especially for the youngest ages</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">and then allow people to track into you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">know what kind of do you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">feeling entrepreneurially you think</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you know feeling engineer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">like are you just want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">interpret</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">the news that you&#39;re getting without</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">being duped by um either</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">are there bad actors or just people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">are bad at math all the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">and you know in some sense i think you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">know i</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">certainly did not have an easy</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:24.880" style="s2">relationship with my formal education at</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">all i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.880" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">at no point but i remember</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">you do remember um but there&#39;s some you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">know i do</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">feel educated somehow um</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">and i would say that as an educated</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">person uh you say math is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">math is everywhere chemistry is</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">everywhere logic is everywhere right</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">physics is everywhere and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t see to the deepest level</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:51.280" style="s2">right you don&#39;t see the world through</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">the eyes of a theoretical physicist</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.280" end="00:49:54.800" style="s2">unless you have very</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">good exposure but the ability to peer</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.800" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">into all of these levels you know when</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">we talk about immunity</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the chemistry at</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">the tip of something called an antibody</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">that you&#39;ve all heard of but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">realize this is a y-shaped molecule</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">that has two pads on it that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">electromagnetic idiosyncrasies that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">stick to some stuff and not other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">for reasons that you could demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">with a child&#39;s magnets right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">ability to be able to see into these</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:19.760" style="s2">puzzles it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">that hard if somebody who knew what they</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.760" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">were doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">uh placed it in front of you in a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:29.200" style="s2">is uh conducive to your acquiring it</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s effortless at some level</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.200" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">but if not then it&#39;s just a struggle</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">memorizing stuff from books that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">stick because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not connected to it you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">you you need to be able to build your</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">own architecture that makes sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">in your head and such that when you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">something new in your head you can even</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.559" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">when you when you receive some</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">information you&#39;re like oh this will fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">there and you know i feel this way very</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">explicitly about</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">um animals and you know ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">you know when i&#39;m when i&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">tropical rainforest and seeing yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">another bird</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">yet another interesting thing if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">have literally the phylogenic tree in my</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">head and go like oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">well um that&#39;s a woodpecker as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">a cuckoo as opposed to a tanager and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">know what you know woodpeckers tend to</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">do and oh that&#39;s something unusual for</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">woodpecker or</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">oh that fits right in it just gives you</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">an architecture right from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">you can you can base things off of i</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">also what you just said makes me want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">give a shout out</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">to the model that was evergreen when it</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">once again and i don&#39;t know that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">program in question did work but</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard this story when i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">flying out to my interview at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">flipping through the at that point it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">was still paper catalogs back in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">would have been early 2002 i guess um</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">like the the catalog and these you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">full-time programs again where you often</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">had multiple faculty teaching</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">um from very different disciplines i</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">found a program</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">that really this this program was the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">one that made me think ah</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">if you can do that there this is where i</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">teaching and therefore learning because</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">i will be learning from my co-faculty</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">and my students as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">it was called centering and it was about</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">the science and art of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">pottery of ceramics and i had you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">over the last few years at that point</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">become a potter myself and was</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">with exactly the artistic manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:18.400" style="s2">of ceramic and i particularly liked will</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:19.599" style="s2">thrown pottery</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.400" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">and of course the physics in wheel</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.599" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">thrown pottery is you know both obvious</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:23.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">intuitive which and you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.520" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">talked about this regard to frisbee as</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">um but also the chemistry like i i know</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">the least about chemistry of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.000" style="s2">natural sciences probably but once you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.000" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">mixing your own glazes and putting</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">pottery into sometimes an oxidation kiln</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">and sometimes a reduction kiln and</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">seeing the difference ways that say you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">know copper reveals itself in an oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">and rich environment versus an</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">oxygen-reduced environment</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">is amazing and it just brings the at</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:53.440" style="s2">least the science and physics to life</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">and you know i never dug my own clay but</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.440" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">you know you could do that and start to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:57.520" style="s2">think about some of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">geology of biology too</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.520" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s what this program allowed</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">like this it could have right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">learning how to make both hand-built and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">wheel thrown uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">pottery and understanding the physics</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">and chemistry of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">in the same place at the same time with</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">the same faculty the same students</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what what&#39;s an education can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">and um that&#39;s part of what that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">of what we do mourn</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">at evergreen right i was just going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">add that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">you also get issues of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">scale with respect to the particle size</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">and the different kinds of clay and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">way that they</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">throw differently on a wheel yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">much thick this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">yeah porcelain versus uh a red</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">a red clay base um yeah i&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">forgotten all the all the various terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">because when we moved i had to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">i had to give up my pottery studio um</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">that we had built</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">for me in our backyard um</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">but you know the diff the different</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">shrinkage right just you know some clay</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">bodies will shrink 15</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">some 25 and uh planning for it</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">and you know if you&#39;ve done it throw and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">it will shrink in some you know with</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">some kind of circularity to it and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s fascinating and remarkable and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">it really does allow you to bring your</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">science and your art brain together</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">well most traditional education doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">let that happen because</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">in that case you&#39;ve got a physical</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">product right there&#39;s also a reward</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">structure built into it which is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">the hidden key to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">all education is that in general we sit</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">you in a chair and the reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:20.160" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">learn the stuff is so that your teacher</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.160" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say mean things that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">about you at the end of the term which</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">is not a good motivational structure</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">i want to get better at this because i</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">saw that right thing and i&#39;d like to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">able to make one like it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">motivator so yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:37.520" style="s2">figuring out how to get the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">in the right place is key</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.520" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">yeah i would also point out if i can</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">just go back to one other thing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">issue of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">um we must unmake history and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">mind you i think the history curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">sucks sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">yeah we must unmake the history</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:55.559" style="s2">curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">because certain populations are</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.559" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">under-represented</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">in it really how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">right how do you know is a question that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">is dependent on a method</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">which is dependent on mathematics so the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">point is these two stories are in</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">we must unmake the history curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">it is an error but the very claim that</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:21.520" style="s2">it is in error about representation</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:23.280" style="s2">implies that there is a method which</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.520" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">would with which we could figure out</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.280" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">what is now they&#39;ve seen you coming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s about your lived experience and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">your personal emotional feeling about it</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">and that is what makes it true</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">right but then it&#39;s not that lived</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">experience and personal emotional</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">feelings about things aren&#39;t important</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">and real but it doesn&#39;t make things true</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">well but</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">but even then yeah like look i&#39;ll sign</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">up for that okay it&#39;s about lived</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">who&#39;s right because which history</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">is it everybody writes their own history</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">curriculum or is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">that the most aggrieved party gets the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">right history for the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">or what exactly is this right no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">latter thing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">it is a an abuse of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">anything about the collective being a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">good thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">and it you know it&#39;s part of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">people so terrified of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">sounds like socialized anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">socialized medicine</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">or or um you know our education</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">sounds like this big boogeyman to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">of people on the right because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">seen what thinking in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">collective can do but you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">my favorite example of yours is the um</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">the fire department</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:31.760" style="s2">oh yeah we have socialized fire</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">departments and good good for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.760" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">yeah i mean we didn&#39;t always right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">we do you know it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a roman example where</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">they used to negotiate with you</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:41.760" style="s2">uh you know and you&#39;d pay more and more</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">to get them to put out your house as it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">burned down because</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">something might be salvaged and then of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.880" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">course there&#39;s a colonial version in</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">you had private fire departments and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">had to have a badge</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">there&#39;s like a little metal badge you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">had to have on your building or the fire</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">department wouldn&#39;t lift a finger to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:57.760" style="s2">help you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">and so we dealt with that problem and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.760" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">socialized the cost</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:02.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s a risk pool and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">perfect sense and some things work this</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">way and some don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">yep but anyways well that&#39;s and that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s key right some things work this</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">way and some things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying that every you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">everything should not be socialized</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">and socialized can go very very badly</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.480" style="s2">but look to the fire department for an</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">example of how this works and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.480" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">patently better than the other options</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">that have been tried</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">right so final cap on this i would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">is if you do not take a verificationist</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">and if you simply even a sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">their epistemology and just see how far</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">you can push it before it breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.640" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">it breaks down almost instantly right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">example of you know if it&#39;s lived</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">experience whose lived experience is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">who&#39;s that&#39;s going to tell us what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">must do what we must say what we must</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">accept</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">the fact that these things can&#39;t even go</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">two steps without contradicting</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">themselves or revealing</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">their absurdity is evidence that in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.720" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">sense instead of saying yes i&#39;m on board</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">the answer is um actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a clue how things work do</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">you right you&#39;re telling us that much</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">yeah and the idea that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:15.680" style="s2">reformulate civilization</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">including education and journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.680" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">right tech sector the tech sector</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">policing all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">um and you are simultaneously telling us</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">that on any</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">posi any question on which we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">investigate it turns out you&#39;re in error</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">and crazy</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">should say well okay okay you have the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">psychosis maybe it is our responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">to help you with that but it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">certainly not our responsibility to put</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">you in charge</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">right that&#39;s not a good idea it is in</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">fact our responsibility to not let you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">be in charge yes that that is what is in</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">fact our responsibility it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">our responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:51.440" style="s2">to you not to put you in charge not just</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">the rest of it right the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.440" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">you may be uh of a mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">that the plane is being piloted by</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">demons and that everybody else on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:01.839" style="s2">plane is a demon and that you are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">only person who isn&#39;t possessed and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.839" end="00:59:05.119" style="s2">therefore you&#39;re the best</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">hope of landing it doesn&#39;t make it true</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.119" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">and we have an obligation to you</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">not to put you in the cockpit right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">that is where we are okay well we got a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">lot more we want to talk about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">coming up in an hour</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:20.240" style="s2">um lots of things in coveted space um</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">and i know you wanted to at least get to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.240" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">talking about the testing regime</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">yeah maybe i&#39;ll just introduce this so i</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">went through a situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">where about a week ago no a little more</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">than a week ago</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:36.400" style="s2">i had a headache that had no explanation</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2">and i was concerned that i might have</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.400" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">coveted um and it was plausible that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">would have contacted it though i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">know of anybody</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:45.440" style="s2">but anyway it revealed to me something</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">that i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">is a reflected in many people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">experience and b that is really</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">significant and um pretty scary</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t think there was a high</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">chance i had cove but i thought there</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">might be a five percent chance that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">had coveted</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">but in light of that i know that if i</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">did have covid i would go to extreme</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">lengths</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">to protect my family from getting it you</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">know if it came down to it</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">i would uh you know if i had a trailer</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">i&#39;d live in it if i had to i&#39;d rent a</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">room somewhere and isolate myself</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">and you know i&#39;d be very careful not to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">give it to anybody who came to the door</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">but i would</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">you know order food or whatever i had to</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">do so i wasn&#39;t contacting</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:30.559" style="s2">the world would be the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">but what i found</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.559" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">was a okay you think there&#39;s a five</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">percent chance you have coveted</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">you need a test okay so i went to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">the test</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">i got put through a rigmarole to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">the test which was bewildering i got the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">stupidest medical advice you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">i was told simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t need to worry about kovid</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">because i had been misled by the press</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:55.680" style="s2">to think it was common</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">and then i was told if i had it there</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.680" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">would be no way to protect my family</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">from getting it too</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">is that the same person same person told</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:03.119" style="s2">me that inside of three sentences of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.119" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">um so that was an official medical</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">consultation</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">then they didn&#39;t know what test they</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:12.640" style="s2">were giving i said is this the pcr test</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">oh we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.640" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">really you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the pcr</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">can you find out can you look it up do</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">you have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">the white paper that comes with the damn</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">test um well i did find out it was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">the paper the pcr test um but anyway i</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.079" style="s2">went</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">i got the swab and then i waited and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.079" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">waited and i waited for a result</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">right and while i waited i was in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.040" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">situation do i assume</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:38.240" style="s2">that i do have it in which case should i</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">be at a hotel</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.240" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">while i&#39;m waiting for this test that</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make any sense not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:48.559" style="s2">so i was caught in a middle ground that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">i know is stupid which is i was wearing</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.559" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">a mask</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">in the house right all the time but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t insisting that you guys wear</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">masks which probably if i did have covid</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">would be the minimum thing necessary</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">right i left all the windows open so we</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">had air flow i spent as much time</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">outside as i could but the point is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">limit of what you can do if you think</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a five percent chance you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">is very different than what you should</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">do if you actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">do have it and it was a completely</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">incoherent</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">response and i have a sense that what</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">other people isn&#39;t that the word that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:22.480" style="s2">more than anything else describes</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">the the collective response to this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.480" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">virus incoherent incoherent yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">absolutely incoherent and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:30.160" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">i did get my test results back they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t mean that much why</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">because well but before you explain then</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">i mean this is super important but</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">um really you had none of the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">symptoms and they disappeared quickly</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">in concert with a negative result it</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">seems it seems likely that that is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">accurate negative result</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:51.920" style="s2">however yeah i mean i took my</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">temperature daily it never went up so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.920" end="01:02:55.280" style="s2">had no other symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">the headache went away i never figured</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.280" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">out what it was about but</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">probably just a stray headache but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">point is okay i get my result</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">and then i start looking into its false</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">negative rate</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">and its false negative rate is through</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">the roof and it varies widely depending</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">upon how many days into symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">you actually had the test taken because</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">guess what</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">its efficacy is density dependent right</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">and so anyway my point is i think first</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:24.720" style="s2">of all every i just coughed during this</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">little chat that is plausibly the first</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.720" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">cough</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">of a uh covid</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">uh set of symptoms right but almost</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.280" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">right at the point that you cough do you</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">take action</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:39.359" style="s2">right so we&#39;ve been handed a well you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">don&#39;t want to give other people covet</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:41.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">but we have not been handed good tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.920" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">with which to know if we have it</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">or to trigger the top level action that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">you would want to take if you did have</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">and my guess is almost everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">navigating this badly</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">almost everybody is probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">rationalizing to themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">that i must not have it until it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">at which point um there&#39;s a less they</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:06.160" style="s2">can you know do we know</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">about how much covid is responsive to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.160" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">our behavior in other words the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">difference between a case that is quick</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">go away in one of these cases that gives</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">people symptoms for</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">months down the road i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">those data if i haven&#39;t seen them</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">and aren&#39;t they i mean they they would</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">be relatively easy to collect and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">there&#39;s some that would be the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">interesting and important for those of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:31.119" style="s2">us who could actually make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">okay given that i can&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.119" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">the collaborations of data that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">seeing thrown at us</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:37.920" style="s2">i&#39;d like to be able to make my own</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">assessment right yeah does does</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.920" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">laying low if if you think you&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:45.039" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:46.799" style="s2">have a an impact on the course of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">disease i think it almost certainly has</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:49.039" style="s2">to but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the data are out there at</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.039" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">least not available and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.640" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">you and i are</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">even if they are the fact that you and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:55.520" style="s2">looking at all the places that we do</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:04:57.520" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">are unaware of what the advice would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.520" end="01:05:02.480" style="s2">about how to keep a case mild</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:02.960" style="s2">if such advice exists at all the fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.480" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.960" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have a test that&#39;s worth a damn</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">you know lots of people are uh getting</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">false negatives who are positive and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:15.200" style="s2">acting in presumably reckless ways as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">result of it</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.200" end="01:05:18.799" style="s2">the whole thing is setting us up for</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">failure that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.799" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">yes we are being set up not only for</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:28.480" style="s2">personal sometimes catastrophic medical</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">failure physiological failure by our</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.480" end="01:05:32.319" style="s2">lack of information but we are being set</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">up for epidemiological failure on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.319" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">that the data is too slow to emerge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">too low quality</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">and the advice on what you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">to do is anecdotal at best</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">so lots of the answer is lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">of people are dying and as much as this</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.160" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">disease isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">deadly as we feared it is potentially</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:54.319" style="s2">much more</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:56.720" style="s2">destructive so every time you hear</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.319" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">oh it&#39;s not that serious because the</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.720" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">death rate</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">per infection is low you should ask the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">okay but how much quality of life is</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">being lost by people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">recover or somewhat recover um because</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">the uh the stuff i&#39;m reading is</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">certainly very frightening on that front</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">yeah no absolutely and here actually if</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">you want to show this sack um</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">here&#39;s just a it&#39;s a science news</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">article so it&#39;s published in</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">you know one of the top tier science</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:25.119" style="s2">journals in the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s one of these news articles uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.119" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">from brain fog to heart damage</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:29.440" style="s2">copenhagen&#39;s lingering problems alarm</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.440" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">it starts with an extended anecdote</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">a neuroscientist who is 38 and has her</p>

<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">both uh anatomical and physiological</p>

<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:53.280" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.000" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">but also um neurological symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.280" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">um like she is</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">she she says she has brain fog and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">such that she cannot do the work that</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">she is accustomed to doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">and that this is uh now i think months</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">oh it says she said just three weeks</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">since march when her body temperature</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">was normal</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">so she&#39;s not dead therefore she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">count as one of the deaths</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:20.400" style="s2">and this is it&#39;s it&#39;s a terrible way of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">assessing the impact of a disease right</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.400" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">deaths versus not deaths well this this</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:27.280" style="s2">woman&#39;s career may</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.319" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">be over maybe over and we also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.280" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">know she&#39;s young</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">she&#39;s in her 30s right we also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">know you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.920" end="01:07:35.359" style="s2">as we&#39;ve discussed models of senescence</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">and the force that pulls you towards the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.359" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">grave</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how much life has been</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">lost the fact that you die from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">initial infection</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">is one thing but if you&#39;ve had 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.839" end="01:07:46.319" style="s2">knocked off your life that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">insignificant fact</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.319" end="01:07:50.000" style="s2">so how many lives versus how much life</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a different way of counting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">counting but it&#39;s it&#39;s just a tiny bit</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:57.680" style="s2">more nuance it&#39;s just a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">uh categorization that is required to</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.680" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">imagine sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:02.240" style="s2">actuarially how you know what was your</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:05.680" style="s2">expected life</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">uh life expectancy um and you know in 50</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:09.599" style="s2">we might be able to know right but it</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">would it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:12.799" style="s2">such noisy data that we might never be</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">able to know but</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.799" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">of people who tested positive and had</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">cases that were serious enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">noted um do they</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">live less time than uh are expected by</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">uh life expectancy tables yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">prediction is that they will</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2">although again that&#39;s only counting just</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">actual you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:34.480" style="s2">number of amount of moments lived as</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">opposed to quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.480" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">right and the quality of life thing you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:39.600" style="s2">know it&#39;s very hard to tell from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">reports the reports are frightening of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.600" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">what people experience</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">yeah but um there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:48.799" style="s2">you know basically people are having an</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:51.279" style="s2">attack on the tissues across their body</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.799" end="01:08:54.719" style="s2">which gives a huge diversity of symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.279" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">i&#39;m also hearing about the recurrence of</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.719" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">these symptoms i have one friend who</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">has a pattern where he had it months ago</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">and he recovered</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:07.359" style="s2">and every month it recurs</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">and the pattern is that the degree of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.359" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">severity</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">decreases over time this is one person i</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">consider him highly reliable in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">the pattern he&#39;s experiencing but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.560" style="s2">the diversity is way too high to even</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">know how to count the damage here</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.560" end="01:09:23.679" style="s2">yeah and that maybe just one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">quickly before we</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.679" end="01:09:29.679" style="s2">we finish for this top hour um</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">that is part of what prompted a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.679" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:35.120" style="s2">scientists uh to uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">create their own vaccine so this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.120" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">published in mit technology review</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">which is a very highly regarded</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">and the headline is for those listing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.719" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">and not watching some scientists are</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.239" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">taking a diy coronavirus vaccine</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">and nobody knows if it&#39;s legal or if it</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:52.640" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:54.320" style="s2">okay fair enough um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.640" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">the you know the story goes on this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:09:58.400" style="s2">their site here</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">um they are calling themselves the rapid</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.400" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">deployment vaccine collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">fascinating there&#39;s there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">good stuff here about what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.159" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">what they&#39;re trying to do what they are</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">not promising</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">um but their basic point is</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:18.640" style="s2">we don&#39;t foresee a a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">valid reliable vaccine coming anytime</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.640" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">soon and given that and given how much</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:27.440" style="s2">about yes pretty low death rate but</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">really high collateral damage rate from</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.440" end="01:10:31.440" style="s2">this virus</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">we are going to prioritize uh creating a</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.440" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">vaccine for ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">and so they&#39;re doing it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">citizen science by scientists</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">yeah george church is a big name</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">exactly so very important person um you</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">know neither of us has we we just came</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">uh became aware of this you know like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">half an hour or so before the podcast so</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">we have not</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:52.159" style="s2">fully voted this but i guess one</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">question that shows up is</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.159" end="01:10:57.840" style="s2">um you just what do you think like</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:11:00.880" style="s2">should citizen scientists</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.840" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">even be allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.880" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">with tools that they have access to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">because some of them have research labs</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">create their own um you know taking full</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:15.679" style="s2">for what happens if it doesn&#39;t go right</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.640" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">their own vaccines at home and you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:20.480" style="s2">my first response is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">well yes and no it&#39;s my response now it</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.480" end="01:11:23.920" style="s2">happens i&#39;m reading here</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:26.080" style="s2">what their mechanism is and basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.920" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a synthetic peptide</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.080" end="01:11:29.920" style="s2">they say these peptides are small</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">synthetically produced</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.920" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">portions of viral sequence now</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">what this means is that they are</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">delivering</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">proteins which are matches</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">for proteins produced by the virus</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:46.560" style="s2">and therefore what they are doing is</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">they are triggering</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.560" end="01:11:52.400" style="s2">the immune system to react to</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">antigens that the virus itself produces</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:55.920" style="s2">so that when the virus shows up your</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:57.040" style="s2">immune system recognizes ahead of time</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.920" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">now that strikes me</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.040" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">as much more likely to be safe</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:04.960" style="s2">than the alternative which is to produce</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">an inactive virus</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.960" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">which therefore informs the immune</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">system by actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">diversifying in your system and</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.880" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">spreading antigens by</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:15.360" style="s2">a mechanism that doesn&#39;t make you sick</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">but does infect</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.360" end="01:12:20.480" style="s2">cells yeah now it&#39;s likely that or or</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:22.080" style="s2">the third case is to kill off a virus or</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.480" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">inactivate it so that your immune system</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.080" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">just sees those particles itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">right and they say here also that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">know the antigen portion that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">chosen could be substituted by others</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:32.080" style="s2">for example the example they give is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">recombinant series cov2 spike</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.080" end="01:12:36.800" style="s2">rbd and that you know for me what that</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">calls up</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.800" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">is okay well uh the efficacy of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:44.239" style="s2">or really any other vaccine and they say</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">two this doesn&#39;t have to be for this</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">you know you could use this mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">this framework um with other antigens</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">from other viruses</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">to make vaccines for other viruses</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">that is likely to be highly different in</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">efficacy</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:00.719" style="s2">depending on which particular antigen</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.280" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">you use and it&#39;s going to be difficult</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.719" end="01:13:04.159" style="s2">to predict in advance which antigen</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">is most likely to produce the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.159" end="01:13:08.560" style="s2">appropriate response in your own body</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">right but let&#39;s put it this way this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.560" end="01:13:11.920" style="s2">potentially a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">the fact that they are not using virus</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.920" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">decreases</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">presumably to zero the chances of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:19.199" style="s2">recombination event</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">in forming the virus of something it</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.199" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t yet know</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">the actual virus so peptides</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.320" end="01:13:27.440" style="s2">probably good choice however the problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.440" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re playing with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">information that the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:37.199" style="s2">uses to understand what antagonists it</p>

<p begin="01:13:37.199" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">and so the possibility exists for</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.960" end="01:13:45.440" style="s2">example to trigger an autoimmunity</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">by leading so you&#39;ve got selection</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.440" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">inside the body functioning</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">to train the virus to be invisible to</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:55.760" style="s2">immune systems that means the closer it</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:57.280" style="s2">gets to self</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.760" end="01:13:59.360" style="s2">the harder it is for the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.280" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">to fight so it&#39;s a go-to strategy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.360" end="01:14:04.480" style="s2">part of you know aids basically</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">uh hiv digs a hole in the immune system</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.480" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">which it then disappears into more or</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what an autoimmune disease</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">means that it tricks your body into</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.640" end="01:14:13.280" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">so that your own body doesn&#39;t go after</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.280" end="01:14:17.040" style="s2">it well no an autoimmune disease let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:17.600" style="s2">say that a virus oh i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.040" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">a virus</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.600" end="01:14:21.520" style="s2">mimics your own particle yes and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">the immune system chases it</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.520" end="01:14:25.040" style="s2">and it starts reacting to stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">ever closer to you and then sooner or</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">later it&#39;s attacking</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.480" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">you know your own tissue like uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:33.120" style="s2">cartilaginous tissue and uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:34.239" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis for example right i</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.120" end="01:14:37.440" style="s2">misspoke yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.239" end="01:14:38.960" style="s2">but but the point is if you&#39;re i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.440" end="01:14:39.440" style="s2">saying this isn&#39;t worth it in this case</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.960" end="01:14:43.120" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.440" end="01:14:43.920" style="s2">share the authors of that paper&#39;s fear</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.120" end="01:14:45.920" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.920" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">danger with covet and the necessity to</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.920" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">do something</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">but in general do we want people messing</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">around with informing immune systems</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:57.760" style="s2">you know based on these things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a big hazard here so the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.760" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">point is we really ought to be having</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:07.440" style="s2">a proper discussion about the costs</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">risks and benefits of allowing this sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.440" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.320" end="01:15:11.760" style="s2">behavior and the problem is we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">it in an environment</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.760" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">where the new york times is telling</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:15.840" style="s2">people that subways are probably safe</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:18.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.840" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">uh you know uh the who is telling us</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.800" end="01:15:20.800" style="s2">that masks don&#39;t work and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.800" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly cooked up for reasons</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:27.280" style="s2">that have nothing to do with our</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:31.199" style="s2">actually being informed so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.280" end="01:15:31.199" style="s2">yep very important problem to be solved</p>
