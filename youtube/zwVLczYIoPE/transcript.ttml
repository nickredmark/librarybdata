<p begin="00:00:01.129" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">all right so yesterday I went to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.650" end="00:00:10.230" style="s2">cooperative cafe put on by BC</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">cooperatives no a whatever he might have</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">missed out though I went to a group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">people who are all in cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">meeting up and heard the term for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:20.250" style="s2">first time although other people might</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">cream it is not the first time and even</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.250" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">fact said it to me but the first time it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">registered in my brain which was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">platform cooperative and I know like</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">stock sees one and that like now they</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">exist but in my education with</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">cooperatives there was three it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">producer as workers and consumers and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:38.940" style="s2">hate the word consumer but that was what</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:42.290" style="s2">I was creating like no I guess I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">I&#39;m creating a platform cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.290" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">but instead of which is amazing there</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:49.289" style="s2">there happening on all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:51.059" style="s2">but having a centralized platform</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.289" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">co-operative gives us a way to compete</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">on a global level that isn&#39;t available</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:59.989" style="s2">in the individual ones and the people at</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">the co-operative and I at the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.989" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">were skeptical of the level of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">transparency and democracy that I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">to create and how and in their fields</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">makes complete sense that there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">competitors that if they have access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">inside information that that puts us at</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">a disadvantage and I don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">that at all because we to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t competition for Facebook but yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">we are like Facebook can&#39;t truly compete</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:29.700" style="s2">within cooperative a cooperative can</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">absolutely compete with anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.700" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">out there especially a global massive</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">cooperative that isn&#39;t all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.470" style="s2">individual ones but like a big where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">get together and create platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.470" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">cooperative after platform cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">after platform cooperative to help</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">people live better lives how people</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">connect people help people get</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">information to access and understand our</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">own data so we can create new platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">cooperatives that use that data to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">our lives better what do you eat what do</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:55.409" style="s2">you what&#39;s your grocery shopping and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:56.939" style="s2">then how can you work with your</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.409" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">neighbors to reduce your costs reduce</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.939" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">the time you spend and and invite people</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">to participate or not anything we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">together a lot of it isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">reinventing the wheel it&#39;s looking or</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">it&#39;s out there and what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">now but eventually it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">recreating all the wheels because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">wheels aren&#39;t efficient when they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">in different directions and working for</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:15.260" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:19.740" style="s2">profit of a select few in their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.260" end="00:02:21.810" style="s2">organization so having the Netflix of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">platform cooperatives we&#39;re like you pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.810" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">$10 a month and you get a vote in all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:28.670" style="s2">those platform properties because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">owned by one umbrella co-operative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.670" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">that means you get to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:34.140" style="s2">ones that help you eat better and help</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:35.820" style="s2">your finances and help you understand</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:45.000" style="s2">you find community to connect with and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.270" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">how we create that together and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.000" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">the big part where they were like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">transparence he&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">because the inside is messy and chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">oh my god I know I&#39;m all for messy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">chaotic in public I it does mean that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">the public I to some degree like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">gonna piss people off that are in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">group yeah but seeing how the sausage is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:00.360" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">if you then don&#39;t want to eat the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.360" end="00:03:03.420" style="s2">sausage maybe you shouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:05.250" style="s2">eating the sausage if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.420" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">see that the Board of Directors is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.250" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">arguing amongst each other to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">decision and making mistakes and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:13.770" style="s2">having to correct them if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">to be on that board that is totally</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.770" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">understandable which is why only people</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">who want that are gonna be able to be on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">the board only people who will do it on</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">camera and as this community we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">doing it live on Twitter&#39;s of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:30.209" style="s2">KC we&#39;re doing it Archive so that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">members can see and transparent because</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.209" end="00:03:32.820" style="s2">someone else brought up the point of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">like well there is all the information</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.820" end="00:03:36.690" style="s2">out there about our politicians but and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:38.370" style="s2">so they are transparent it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:39.959" style="s2">available I&#39;m like yeah transparency</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.370" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">also includes understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.959" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">information not just spewing it all out</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">there but putting it in a usable format</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">and so most of my ideas kind of stem</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">from platform cooperatives that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">create together where everyone who has</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">an idea for a platform cooperative has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">way to make it happen because one person</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">is they&#39;re gonna competence all the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">issues that a regular app developer</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:01.350" style="s2">comes up with is there enough use is</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">there enough users to make this viable</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.350" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">how do we make money at it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:09.299" style="s2">stay afloat so because of the other two</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">how do we market so we get more of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.299" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">people and all of those things every</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">person has to come up with it so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:15.570" style="s2">same ideas come up with again and again</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">and again like share food with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.570" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">neighbors cook a meal and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">never like the threshold of usability so</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">that it stays there and every people</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:24.810" style="s2">spend tens of thousands hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:26.910" style="s2">thousand dollars to develop an app but</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.810" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">then is never used by people and even</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.910" end="00:04:32.699" style="s2">though it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">brilliant idea so taking that system of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.699" end="00:04:36.599" style="s2">creating apps but doing it in the open</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:38.909" style="s2">transparently and democratically or were</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.599" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">not everyone&#39;s gonna get everything they</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.909" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">want that&#39;s not how the world works most</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">people will get most of what they want</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:46.169" style="s2">most of the time especially when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">progression so the first app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.169" end="00:04:49.979" style="s2">being made might not be your your</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">favorite thing but then it like the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.979" end="00:04:53.190" style="s2">one in the next one in the next one we</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:55.409" style="s2">have enough of them and when we unlock</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.190" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">simultaneous projects there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.409" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">something for everyone my issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">I actually I want tech people I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:03.569" style="s2">people&#39;s expertise it&#39;s not I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">to come off the night I don&#39;t but what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.569" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">want to create tech for and with are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">people who don&#39;t necessarily use</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:10.620" style="s2">technology or use it but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">necessarily know how to code it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">want to create tech for the techies I</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:16.319" style="s2">want to create for everyone and that&#39;s</p>
