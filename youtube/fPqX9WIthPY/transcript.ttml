<p begin="00:00:04.100" end="00:00:09.420" style="s2">hey everyone so I said I was done with</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.960" end="00:00:11.190" style="s2">the London real story after our series</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.420" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">of films about their digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.190" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">platform scam but I&#39;m forced to return</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:19.289" style="s2">to it because they have issued a</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">copyright claim got many of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.289" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2">investigations taken down and also a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">copyright strike against rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.269" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">which is serious business because three</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">copyright strikes in your channel is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">taken down the reason I&#39;m making this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">film is not just a capitalise on crying</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">censorship it&#39;s because it really</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">highlights all of the problems that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">was pointing to in the first series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">films which if you&#39;re not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">the story I also wrote an article on</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">medium and linking to in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">if you want to familiarize yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">effectively it was a story that</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">highlighted all of the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">free speech and censorship the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:56.610" style="s2">censorship decisions of the big tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">platforms but also how censorship itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:01.500" style="s2">could be weaponized by bad actors you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">know people who might do something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.500" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t know raise a million dollars off</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">your followers under false pretenses and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">then they&#39;d all turn on you but the main</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:14.180" style="s2">issue is that in that original film I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">talked about how we the kind of wider</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.180" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">YouTube community people making content</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">had to become self policing otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">the big tech platforms would come and do</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">it and they would do it really badly</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">so the fact that this copyright system</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">can be weaponized and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">explain how it&#39;s been weaponized is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">really serious serious problem so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">got this notification this morning a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">copyright claim copyright strike and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">video taken down click on it and sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">enough it&#39;s from London real TV and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:49.310" style="s2">amazing thing is that it&#39;s this film</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">that they&#39;ve done a copyright claim on</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.310" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">we did it over and over a million love</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">is the answer we must now prepare for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">war and it&#39;s this particular part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">film where Brian Rose talks about head</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">faking his audience so this is a quick</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">update the next day because a few more</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:13.150" style="s2">copyright claims have come in so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:16.420" style="s2">latest is the London real investigate</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.150" end="00:02:19.540" style="s2">Update has been removed copyright claim</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.420" end="00:02:22.569" style="s2">the original investigation has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.540" end="00:02:24.489" style="s2">blocked copyright claim and so has the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.569" end="00:02:27.129" style="s2">update with coffee Zilla and rebel</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.489" end="00:02:29.739" style="s2">wisdom but for about 24 hours the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.129" end="00:02:31.359" style="s2">original investigation was up with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.739" end="00:02:34.359" style="s2">copyright claim but all of the ad</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.359" end="00:02:37.930" style="s2">revenue was going to London real so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.359" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">Brian I have donated the really</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:41.650" style="s2">up thing about this is that copyright</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">law is designed so that this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.650" end="00:02:46.629" style="s2">thing doesn&#39;t happen it always includes</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:48.370" style="s2">a defense of fair dealing I know this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.629" end="00:02:50.200" style="s2">from working as a producer at channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.370" end="00:02:51.819" style="s2">news for many years and I was very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.200" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">careful about the way I use this</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.819" end="00:02:55.450" style="s2">material because I know the rules so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:02:57.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a few key things that you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.450" end="00:02:59.470" style="s2">to do to make sure you have a fair</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.010" end="00:03:01.090" style="s2">dealing defense one you have to label</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.470" end="00:03:02.799" style="s2">the material clearly so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.090" end="00:03:04.989" style="s2">trying to pass it off as your own which</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.799" end="00:03:07.989" style="s2">I did with every single clip that I use</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.989" end="00:03:09.819" style="s2">or very careful about that too you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.989" end="00:03:11.590" style="s2">to use the minimum amount to make your</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.819" end="00:03:14.620" style="s2">point you can&#39;t just use it as wallpaper</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.590" end="00:03:15.939" style="s2">or b-roll but you can use it just to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.620" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">illustrate the point that you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.939" end="00:03:20.620" style="s2">to make or the criticism that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:23.319" style="s2">trying to make which I also did I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.620" end="00:03:24.970" style="s2">tried contacting Brian Rose on multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.319" end="00:03:26.650" style="s2">occasions to get his response although</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.970" end="00:03:29.169" style="s2">that&#39;s more of a defamation defense</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:31.810" style="s2">rather than a copyright defense the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.169" end="00:03:35.079" style="s2">really up thing about this whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.810" end="00:03:39.879" style="s2">situation is that the reason for using</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.079" end="00:03:42.579" style="s2">this particular clip was because I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.879" end="00:03:44.739" style="s2">making the point in multiple films that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.579" end="00:03:48.010" style="s2">Brian rose wasn&#39;t being honest with his</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.739" end="00:03:50.709" style="s2">audience and in this clip he admitted it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:52.979" style="s2">he admitted that he&#39;d been head faking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.709" end="00:03:56.500" style="s2">or being untruthful with his audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.979" end="00:03:58.690" style="s2">this was the evidence that proves the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.500" end="00:04:01.449" style="s2">point that was being made and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.690" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">person who makes that claim can use</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.449" end="00:04:08.169" style="s2">copyright law to have it taken down now</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:10.629" style="s2">the process from here as I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.169" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">is I need to object to the copyright</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.629" end="00:04:17.799" style="s2">claim and then it goes back to Brian</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:19.599" style="s2">Rose and London real who then have 30</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.799" end="00:04:21.969" style="s2">days to decide whether it&#39;s a breach of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.599" end="00:04:24.980" style="s2">copyright or not and only after that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.969" end="00:04:27.470" style="s2">process some way down the line does you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.980" end="00:04:29.480" style="s2">get involved the whole point of fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.470" end="00:04:32.330" style="s2">dealing is that you can do news</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.480" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">commentary of ongoing events and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:36.350" style="s2">can&#39;t be used to evade scrutiny which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:38.270" style="s2">basically what&#39;s happening here and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.350" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">course the massive irony is that Brian</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.270" end="00:04:41.810" style="s2">Rose&#39;s digital freedom platform was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:43.550" style="s2">supposed to be all about free speech in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.810" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">the first place so it&#39;s kind of ironic</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.550" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">that he&#39;s deleting a load of comments</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:48.200" style="s2">from his site and issuing copyright</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">notices against people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.200" end="00:04:51.350" style="s2">criticizing him so we just want to play</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:52.850" style="s2">a short clip from the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.350" end="00:04:54.620" style="s2">investigation that I put out just</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.850" end="00:04:56.870" style="s2">explaining what I think the bigger issue</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.620" end="00:04:58.250" style="s2">is so the big picture framing I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.870" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">say is that we&#39;re in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.250" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">interregnum period between two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve let the old gatekeepers are losing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">their power increasingly fast but what</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t have is you can imagine there</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">might be some kind of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:18.980" style="s2">Network way of coming to truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:21.020" style="s2">democratic way of coming to truth that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.980" end="00:05:23.630" style="s2">could emerge on the other side we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.020" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">there yet I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.630" end="00:05:27.170" style="s2">that we use our free speech to call out</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">people who we think are being</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.170" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">irresponsible because right now if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:35.890" style="s2">don&#39;t do this if we don&#39;t use our free</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">speech and somehow create some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.890" end="00:05:40.460" style="s2">accountability then what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:42.230" style="s2">happen is that the big tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.460" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">are going to take those decisions for us</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.230" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna if we don&#39;t use free</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">speech with responsibility we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">lose it in the first film I called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:54.200" style="s2">whole situation a clusterfuck this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:55.730" style="s2">another level of clusterfuck arried so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.200" end="00:05:57.410" style="s2">my whole point was that YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.730" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">making editorial decisions without the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.410" end="00:06:01.850" style="s2">skill set to do it so what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:04.700" style="s2">and how will this system become self</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.850" end="00:06:07.100" style="s2">policing if YouTube&#39;s regulations mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:08.480" style="s2">that bad actors can weaponize it so as I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.100" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">said before I didn&#39;t really want to</p>
