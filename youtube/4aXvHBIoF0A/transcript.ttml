<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">so any any opening thoughts um at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">risk of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">monologuing any opening thoughts on uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">what the meta tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">yeah i told peter to stop me if i</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">started monologuing because i have</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">sometimes i have a bad habit um with</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">um which a few people here probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">already know but the first few minutes i</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">i was trying to i was shouting out a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">people in the audience but i think i was</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">muted the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">so hello friends um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">uh tldr i think the i would describe the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">meta tribe</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:25.760" style="s2">as being</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">something like more like a sociological</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">phenomenon than an actual social</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">so i i would describe it as being</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">something distinct</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">uh type than something like game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">or meta modernism or effective altruism</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">or the or the rationality movement</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">because with each of these different</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">they they tended to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">some amount of some greater amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">central organization</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">i mean to a certain degree the type</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">already existed</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">uh and the organizers coalesce those</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">people so you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">in the case of rationality movement you</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">had eleazar writing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">not a lot of people know this actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">about the rationality movement one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">the biggest things getting people into</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">the rationality movement was elias</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">writing harry potter and the methods of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">rationality</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">which was a harry potter fan fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">then that in turn</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">was one of the biggest things</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">responsible for the creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">effective altruism movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">um because the rationality movement fed</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">into that um but then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">the effect of altruism movement itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">also i think you had will</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">will mccaskill earlier on earlier today</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">um had a set of extremely competent</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">organizers right at the beginning i</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">think will was there at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">um you had toby or there at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">beginning um you had jeff anders there</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">at the beginning and they they all sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">of like coalesced and formed a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">conference</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">um to deliberately coin the term and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">cohere the thing as a movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:51.680" style="s2">um this is a lot of shocking for not</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">describing what the meta tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.680" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">basically i think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">the meta drive isn&#39;t like that in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">a set of people who find themselves at</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">of fixed points of view</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:06.560" style="s2">um who find themselves at the end of not</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">only modernism</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.560" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">and and post-modernism but um find</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">themselves in a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">where it doesn&#39;t really make as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">sense to them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">say this is the one true ideology this</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">is the one true religion and so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">um however they&#39;ve been typically there</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">are feeders</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">from these from these previous phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">so rationality seems like it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">feeder</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">i would say effective altruism as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">then you have events</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">um like burning man i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">another feeder and ephemeral just sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">of like burning man at sea for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">silicon valley people um and then and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">then there are things which are more</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.000" style="s2">almost like pure metatribe which i</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">describe as feeders to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.000" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">to the broader meta tribe which i would</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">think game b is this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">the stoa is this um daniel</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">schmuckenberger</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">feeds a lot of people into it and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">um but the highest concentration</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">interestingly i think is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">weird conversational shelling point or</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">gathering place</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">that you find in a specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">algorithmically created</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">section of twitter like the way it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">but you know people talk about twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">being hell and and people constantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">verbally assaulting one another but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">there&#39;s this one section of sort of meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">tribe twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">that&#39;s evolved out of what you might</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">call and i can i can define some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">these terms but out of post-rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">rationality twitter where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">just really nice</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">and trying to earnestly like take pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">uh non-partisan views on all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">different issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">discuss things um with some semblance of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.199" style="s2">rationality but like not leaving out</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">romanticism um</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.199" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s largely sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">algorithm to thank in in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">way because it&#39;s all the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">liking each other&#39;s uh comments and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">being suggested</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">uh a profile which is a which is more of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">the same essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s one of these things that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">of emerged i would say most in twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">due to these algorithmic bubbles but</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">then you see it taking place all over</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">physically in the world too so i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">say that there are pretty physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">metatribe networks too</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">but i want to emphasize that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">like a formally at least the way i see</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">it it&#39;s not a formally organized thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">but more an emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">of a bunch of people who have all read</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">similar books and engaged similar memes</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">and so forth i mean peter i&#39;d be curious</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">to have you um</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">i&#39;d be curious to have you define it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">because the the way that i heard the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">term was from you</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">um it was uh between a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">between you and daniel thorson</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">i think on i forget whether it was your</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">um and then and then it might have</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">originally come from jared</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">james but you guys i felt like fleshed</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">it out during that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">right i can&#39;t remember what daniel and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">were talking about but the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">is coming to mind is the one i had uh</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">the super connector of the meta tribe i</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">don&#39;t even think he likes the word meta</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:57.759" style="s2">but anymore but uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">and we were talking with jared uh jason</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">tim adeline um and i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">or just i don&#39;t know who mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">but i got uh this</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">dichotomy of the kinetic tribe you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">like becoming tribal around your</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">neighbors and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">resilience localism all that type of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">stuff and the meta tribe</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">like kind of the people that resonate</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">with your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">who are in that kind of meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">post-rational space</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">because they&#39;re not really next door i</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">can&#39;t really just say hey ring their</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">doorbell</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">but i can throw a beacon on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">like an event or a podcast right and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">truck and find the others that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">and then have and then the idea with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">places like the stoa or inter intellect</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.720" style="s2">all these other kind of campfires that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">are emerging is to get into</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.720" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">you know relationship like like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">feel each other let&#39;s talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">let&#39;s kind of like um</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">you know belong together and you can do</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">that better on a zoom call rather than</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">just like a you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">a tweet um so that&#39;s the idea that get</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">the sense of tribalness</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">online with people who are into these</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">meta ideas and post-rational</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">proclivities</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">yeah and you know the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">about that word meta tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty funny for for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">reasons one is that if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">try where if i think if you were to try</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">to assign</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">the label metatribe to to most meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">tribe members they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">interested in having a label applied to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">which is an interesting feature of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">tribe just because typically when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">talk about tribes</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">it&#39;s about kind of like you know wearing</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">your baseball jersey</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">and also your like yankees number one</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">mit on your on your hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">and through the meta tribe it feels</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">almost like the opposite because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s a bunch of these kids</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">who never knew what lunch table to sit</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">in middle school um and who maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">know the way i described it which a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">bunch of people reacted to very</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">is sort of these in-betweeners who have</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">a bunch of friends</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">who are the skaters and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">friends who are the punks and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:47.600" style="s2">friends with the drama kids and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">some friends who are the jocks</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.600" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">and then in today&#39;s you know more uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">post-middle school scene like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">friends who are social justice a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">of friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">hyper conservative or even neo-reaction</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">a bunch of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">grey tribe or rationalists and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">scientists but then they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">identify with any of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">and they typically feel not ostracized</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong word because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">them are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">sort of widely accepted by these groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">but maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">in some significant sense alone because</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">it never makes sense for them to just</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">see the world through any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">lenses um it&#39;s sort of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">things where</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this fable of the blind</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">men trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">piece together the elephant um and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">they take this seriously that um each of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">these things is only feeling one part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that&#39;s the first reason i</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">feel like the meta tribe is funny and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">then the second reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">is that it&#39;s one of these tribes that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">a funny way kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">disdains the idea of an out group you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">know it might</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">while i&#39;ve well it&#39;s been my experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">that the meta tribe folks are</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">in favor of uh things like curation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">um it seems like you know curation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">your allies curation of you know who</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">might join a meeting etc like not not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">the sort of radical conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">um they seem to be pretty against the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">idea that there are like good guys and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">bad guys or people to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">excluded because of their nature or or</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">what have you</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">and so i&#39;m sort of on two fronts</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">the name kind of fails but then it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">really feel like there should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">at least a placeholder label to uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">to to describe the thing and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">think there&#39;s a really i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">think there&#39;s a better one</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m wondering what you think are</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">common characteristics of people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">would be you know fairly classified in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">this meta tribe</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">um and i recall anna gatt who does the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">inter intellect she had like a great</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">article that had like all these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">i&#39;m like yep that&#39;s me that&#39;s me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">um and with the the meta tribe what</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">comes to mind i was talking to aaron</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">lewis about this too but when you came</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">on my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">um it&#39;s like the grape hill the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">getting grape killed</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">uh absolutely that&#39;s funny this is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">the venkatesh route term so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">i like that you know you you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">a blue pill you&#39;re born into the blue</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">pill in a way you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">normally reality and then you take a red</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">pill and the red bill could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">like anything could be social justice it</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">could be like some reactionary thing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">then it just really hardens you it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">fossilizes your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">worldview us versus them and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">find your tribe through that idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">but then you take the gray pill and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">kind of muddies the waters a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">and then you&#39;re uncertain of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">previous red pill</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">um and then you&#39;re just kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">know so basically you bounced around</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">maybe you took a couple of red pills</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">until you got to the the great pill and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">people who are in this had that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">experience and then now they they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">this comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">relationship or they have a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">relationship with being in unknowingness</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t have that existential anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">they got over that that phase</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:44.959" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s one thing um and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">other thing is like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.959" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">bespoke journey everyone has this</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">eclectic bookshelf and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">things there right first they read</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">nietzsche and then they read dune and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">then they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">thinking fast and slow and then a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">different person it&#39;s like first they</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">read permaculture and then they saw</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">daniel schmuckenberger videos it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s rewinding and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">that that kind of like intellectual lone</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">wolf</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">auto didact quality there and i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">associated with that is the existential</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">like to kind of really want to find the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">others and so i feel like with the store</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">there&#39;s all these like</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.440" style="s2">eclectic weirdos uh you know like kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.440" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">like finding each other yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:21.440" style="s2">i think part of the reason i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">articulate this as a social as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.440" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">potential sociological phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:26.079" style="s2">is just to reify it so there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">little bit more of a beacon for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.079" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">people to find each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">despite um most meta tribers not wanting</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">to adhere to any labels</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">it does feel pretty important to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">having things like the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">or um a sort of a description of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">phenomenon so that the people can can</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">link up with one another</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">because whenever whenever i encounter</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">someone who i would consider</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">a sort of member of this demographic</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">they typically have this sort of jaw job</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">reaction</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">of me and the other people having read</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">many of the same books like how is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">that you have read keith johnstone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">impro and also saw him on the store last</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">week and then also</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">like you&#39;re interested in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">science and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve read a bunch of old school like</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">sociological texts</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">and and and typically they found</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">themselves to be the only person who</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">cares about all these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">and meanwhile they&#39;re also watching like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">you know uh charlie kaufman films and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">they&#39;re quite an aspect or like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">romantic in that way</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">and and typically they&#39;re you know they</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">can only find</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">uh like meet the needs to satisfy these</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">different parts of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">by hanging out with their particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">artist friend and then maybe next night</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">they&#39;ll discuss genetics with their</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">scientist friends</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">and then they typically don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">outlet to to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">sort of synthesize them all but i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:43.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a special group in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">way i think it&#39;s just what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.839" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">is just the edge</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">of an inevitable historical it does</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">it almost like maybe even the breaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">of the historical cycle in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">um because it seems like up until</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">something like the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">uh the the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">the the overall narrative you could you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">could describe</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">for for most people in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">like that that that as a sentence where</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">whether it&#39;s here&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">um you you attend your job from nine to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">five</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">you create an atomic family in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">suburbs that&#39;s one version</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">another version is here&#39;s what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">on you&#39;re born into like a church family</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a mormon for life um no</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">disrespect to the mormons i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">pretty incredible faith um and then i</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">think after that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">you see the the 1960s and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.199" style="s2">post-modern turn</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">where it&#39;s more like it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.199" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">red pill as you described it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:38.399" style="s2">from the blue pill to the red pill of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s really going on so you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">from here&#39;s what&#39;s going on to here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:44.880" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">and then people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.880" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">subversively describe</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">uh what appears to be the true</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">underlying structures of reality or</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">um in almost a sort of rebellious way</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">and then like you said typically</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">people often have a bunch of red pills</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:00.160" style="s2">and then often they&#39;re in reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.160" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">so you know i&#39;ve met people who who took</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">like the social justice red pill</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">and then they took the new reaction red</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">pill and then only after that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">did they come to some sort of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">between these things um which you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">describe as like the gray pill</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">um or sometimes even the reverse i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">got i think i&#39;ve encountered the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">only once um but nonetheless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">um and so it feels like the latest</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">version is something like i have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">which is which is not to say let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s going on or like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:33.279" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">adopt provisional ideas of what might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.279" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">happening and act on those</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">i think the meta tribe is unique in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">it actually does take action it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">not it&#39;s not this post-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">malaise where it&#39;s like who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">is reality anyway let me play xbox or</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">um typically they&#39;re pretty active</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">people and they&#39;re trying to do things</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">solve existential risk um like um</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">the the agi problem or uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">or synthetic biology pandemics um or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to solve something like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">so they&#39;re not inactive um but they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">going about things from</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">uh sort of a multi-perspective view</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">which just feels like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">the inevitable thing to happen once you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">have a world a globalized world full of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">tons of clashing narratives</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">like it&#39;s impossible i&#39;ve got this from</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">this line basically from uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">sorry foreal who&#39;s the head teacher at</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">monastic academy</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">where the way he describes it is nobody</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">believes the stories anymore</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">like typically you would grow up inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">of a story and adhere to it your entire</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">life and not have it be challenged</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.759" style="s2">and now you get a different story from</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">your high school teacher and then when</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.759" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">you get home</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">you get a different story from your mom</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">and then when you go out and hang out</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">with your friends it&#39;s a totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">different story about like what life is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">and what the world is from them</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">and so i think that inevitably is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">going to lead to a breaking point</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">because the mind seeks coherence it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t sit well with um cacophony</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.800" style="s2">and i see the meta tribe is basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">attempting to to tame the chaos by</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">trying to find some</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">some synthesis path where you can have</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">all these</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">shifting truths and not be like</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.480" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">whirling through a maelstrom all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">i&#39;m so going to pivot the chats in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">moment of the q a another thing i want</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">to present to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">um i noticed like maybe a meta tribal</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">skill set that i see is like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">metagame</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">um and i currently hold that as like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">there&#39;s an ecology of games</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">that are currently playing and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">ability to zoom out and have choice of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">which one you want to play</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">and then you and i had a good moment uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">when keith johnstone uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">uh the guy who kind of invented improv</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:31.760" style="s2">came to the store robin hansen was there</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">and he asked him and then i primarily</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.760" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">message you like</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">robin is cute right and then you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">they&#39;re playing different games</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">because robin with like you know system</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">two analytical propositional mode</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">and keith johnson&#39;s like zero [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">given he&#39;s like you know like just doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">his own thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">um and so this idea of like not even</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">code switching perspectives but</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">code switching different games right</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">yeah and do you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">um i think yeah it&#39;s exhausting actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">uh someone that maybe they&#39;re here i</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">forget their twitter handle</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">but someone commented on twitter that um</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">being in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">in the sociological space of like high</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">betweenness centrality</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">um of being between all these different</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">scenes and not a part of any of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">um and being forced to switch games all</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">the time is is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">is exhausting and also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">heartbreaking actually which is why it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.880" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">feels nice to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">finally be attempting to come together</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:23.039" style="s2">because i i don&#39;t know about you but</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.039" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">most of my friends i would not give the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">give the arbitrary label meta tribe um</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:32.000" style="s2">you know i have friends who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">super conservative and trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.000" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">i have friends who are super social</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">justice and marching in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">every day</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">um i&#39;m friends with tons of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">the average post-rationalist might</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">describe as a normie or something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.760" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">um and i love them all like really</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">but then i do have to kind of play a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">different game with each of them in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">order to relate</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">i have to have to do this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">translational game um and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">it&#39;s just this experience of like i</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">in this in this place who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">multi-hyphenate in this way like</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">mean i think i think for a while i was</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">like on overdrive</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">and i was just kind of like many</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">different like private chat groups</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">you know all over twitter and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">just i think i just burned myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">out and so i think i&#39;m probably at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">place now where</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">give me like two months or a month and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">then i&#39;ll start itching to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">you know to branch out again and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">i guess push myself in a different</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">direction um</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know maybe maybe you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">maybe how old are you maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">younger than me maybe i&#39;m just kidding i</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">okay so yeah i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m a few years</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">older than you so maybe i&#39;m just getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">or maybe i&#39;m more antsy yeah there we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">there we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:52.960" style="s2">peter actually before we turned it to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">the audience i had two questions for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.960" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">that i was that i&#39;m still really curious</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">about so there are these two phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">that i&#39;m linked to but that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say i&#39;m a part of its</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">demographic per se even though i</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">think that they&#39;re both parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">meta tribe so there&#39;s metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">um which i feel like in its attitude</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">kind of describes almost exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">as the implicit shared philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">between metatron members but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">like sociologically distinct contingent</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">just in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">the people who hang out with one another</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">inside of it um that&#39;s one and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">and then there&#39;s game b uh which i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">friends with a bunch of the game b</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">people like i&#39;m friends with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">jordan green hall who</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">um i think was one of the original</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">creators um if not the original creator</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">um and then i&#39;m curious as someone who i</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">perceive to be more involved with these</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">scenes what is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">how would you describe their overlap</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">with what you and i would describe as</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">which feels like a sort of more um a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">wider meta tribe</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.720" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">and uh yeah both in terms of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">and maybe social like sociologically how</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">do they</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">relate like who&#39;s friends with who um</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">do you have a take on that um maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">can riff off uh your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">my senses um</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know enough about</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">metamodernism i whenever i ask someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">what should i read on it they point me</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">to the same book which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">abashedly still haven&#39;t read the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">listening society</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">um and that that that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">core text so i would have to really read</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">that before</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">i understood the ideological question</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">but at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">on the sociological question my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:40.159" style="s2">that part of the venn diagram has more</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">overlap with memes like complexity</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">theory and this is just my sense i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">know it very well</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">and things like permaculture and i see</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">the word regeneration thrown around a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">lot which is which i take to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:57.520" style="s2">um part of the overall like green green</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">movement or green technology movement</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.520" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">um but they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">talking about like red pills and gray</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">pills they seem to have been red pilled</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">away from that and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">further gray peeled away from that um</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">and then as for game b</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">it seems to have a lot of overlap</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">although not total overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">and from what i from what i understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">game b part part of why i like it is my</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">impression that it&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">is that it&#39;s um it&#39;s describing game a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">which is and correct me from wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">which i take to be a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">seeking of an omni-win scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">basically all</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">sentient beings can come into</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">some scenario where nobody feels like</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">they have to defect on one another or</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">and just that attitude alone</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">distinguishes it from oh sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">that would be game b um not not game a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">so that the game b is the only win</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">and then game a is the more default</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">where you have these game theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">dynamics where there&#39;s tons of defection</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">um and people aren&#39;t all sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">same side so to speak and performing</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">sort of one global</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">optimization game in order to make all</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">all sentient beings either on earth or</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">beyond uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">have a good time that&#39;s that&#39;s my sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">um as for that the the overlap of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">um the meta tribe it seems like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">interestingly distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">the post-rationalist contingent at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.480" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">at least in terms of who&#39;s friends with</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">and that maybe um blends more with uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">but that&#39;s just my outside view from not</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">being a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">the two scenes metamodernism and uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:36.320" style="s2">yeah yeah and i actually wrote um</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">an article or a journal entry called</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.320" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">weird stoicism where i said like</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">and i and like there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">things you can look at you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">the tribal element like what is the vibe</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:51.600" style="s2">of the tribe like what are the type of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">people that get attracted to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.600" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">and then the propositions and i would</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">say the propositions are</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">like really compatible and just like</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">metamodern is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">kind of a developmental lens you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">like there&#39;s pre-modernity there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">modernity there&#39;s post-majority and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s meta modernity</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">where consists of these meta systematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">thinkers trying to make sense of like</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">think a few of them basically anybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">can enter</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">so i think the stoa is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">where you&#39;re certainly</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">well the thing you&#39;re describing is real</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">like you&#39;re more likely to have heard</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">about the stella</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">if you have an online presence in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:29.359" style="s2">first place um but also</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">a friend can just send you a link to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.359" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">stoa and you can pop into zoom</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">um i would say the same is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">i haven&#39;t investigated inter intellect</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">it might be similar in this way</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">um i would say evolving evolving ground</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">is also one of these more open things</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">where you can join the evolving ground</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">slack um i think their website is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">evolvingground.org but i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">probably if you google it it&#39;ll pop up</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">oh awesome um but but to your point i</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">think you&#39;re pointing to a super</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">real thing and one one route around</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">this problem that i&#39;ve seen people take</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">is there&#39;s a huge tradition now um</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">lasting a few few years maybe that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">a tradition but there&#39;s there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new practice you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">might say of making</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">what are called alts on twitter um where</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">uh who who similarly are not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">be a part of public discussions under</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">under their actual names uh will sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">build an online persona</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:32.079" style="s2">or just their own version of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">and then have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.079" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">have an avatar that is maybe like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:39.599" style="s2">photo of a roman statue</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">or some sort of crazy psychedelic art</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.599" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">or a historical portrait or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">it will be named something other than</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">what they are like the famous one here i</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">think is uh eigenrobot</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">um who uh is i would say one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">people at the center of this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">that i&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">and uh they they they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">um able to play play the sort of game</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">without having to get personally</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">involved which comes with all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">possible consequences like</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">having your old tweets dug up you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">in the future by some ai algorithm and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">finding all the ways in which it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">politically correct or something which</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">would not be ideal</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">um that said that you know creating an</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">alt still takes a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:25.359" style="s2">ton of effort um so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not uh it&#39;s not like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.359" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">can just pop into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">um so beyond beyond the the the avenues</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">that i described of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">that anyone could just pop into peter</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">i&#39;m curious if</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">um if you have thoughts about other ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">people could get involved if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">similar to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">uh for some reason your name isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">popping up oh evan</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">if they&#39;re similar to evan where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">been because because tons of most</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">i would say most of the people who i</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">would describe as meta tribe are</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">actually in evan&#39;s position</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">they say they say exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">things like i&#39;ve been around since</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">you know the early like extropians with</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">nick bostrom</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">or you know i&#39;ve been around since the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">beginning of less wrong like not only</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">less wrong 2.0 but less wrong 1.0 when</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">they reached slate star codex</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">but they they haven&#39;t found a good entry</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">right yeah and that&#39;s what i found um</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">i had a podcast before the store and i</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">called it intellectual explorers podcast</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">and i rebranded it to the store</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">and a lot of my podcast listeners came</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">to the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s like oh i can participate</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">now because it&#39;s like an event</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">um and uh yeah two thousand come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">i just wanna</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">flag it like uh so at the hour we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">stop recording but we&#39;ll have like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">free associated conversation i just</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">wanna have the recording so we can throw</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">this as</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">maybe a beacon for meta tribalists um</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">so the two thoughts came to mind with</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">the alt strategy</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">uh there&#39;s this uh i mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">before but there&#39;s a satanic group</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">called the order of the nine angles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">a memetic tribe</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">like titanic yeah and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">just basically like they they um</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">recommend their</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">uh their people that uh the initiates to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">sacrifice people they there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">evil dark [ __ ] uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t respect actual people yes to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">get in okay and then one of their</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">um kind of initiate rights is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">uh they call it the insight roles is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">join extremist organization whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">like an islamic terrorist group</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">or um like some kind of uh white</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">nationalist group</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">and embody it completely in order to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">dismantle uh you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">civilization&#39;s western civilization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">grasp on them just that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">your subjective prison and so they just</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.040" style="s2">radically free themselves and then they</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">can pursue the the satanic goal whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">so but like maybe repurposing</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">fascinating for good though</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.079" style="s2">like that&#39;s the kind of old strategy</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">where you can kind of create an all join</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.079" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">like maybe a social justice twitter or</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">join a post right twitter or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">um that&#39;s cool and you can authentically</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">be an old like you just like hey this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">just my alt account</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.680" style="s2">um and then just really embody that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.680" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">to kind of like feel it fight with it</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">learn from it beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">and then maybe shake it off um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">that came from i think that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">cool strategy</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">uh and then the other thing to answer</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:58.839" style="s2">evan&#39;s question is um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">i think this raul has something called</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.839" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">netplay in comparison to like networking</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">uh so basically your network increases</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">by just playing and that&#39;s how i treated</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">my podcast it&#39;s like i had a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">oh my god people are so willing to come</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">on podcast i didn&#39;t like i had no show</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">notes i didn&#39;t do anything i just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">to talk to cool people</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">and then just like like i rekindled my</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">friendship with i wasn&#39;t friends with</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">john varvakey and then we became</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">like a research project together so</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">maybe using repurposing these game a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">tools like podcasting or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">as a way to net play in order to find</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">the others</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:36.320" style="s2">and actually on that note um my you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.320" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t really on twitter until maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">year ago when when all these people like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">michael kersey and samo buryar were</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">telling me you gotta get on twitter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">like where the action is happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">and i kept starting and stopping because</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">i was under</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">something like 500 followers and it just</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel like a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">and then the thing that ended up working</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">for me because there is a pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">startup cost on something like twitter</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">which is basically treating it as a as</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">an intellectual sketchpad</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">where i just worked out my ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">public and then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">like people i slowly got follows and now</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;s to the point where there are enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">followers where i can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">actual conversations with people like</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">people who regularly chime in</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">i think there are probably even a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">people here who i do that with who i</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">found through those means</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">um but i think if i uh if i just</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">started on twitter and was like huh how</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">come nobody&#39;s engaging</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">anything that i say then i probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">would have given up in like the first i</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">mean i did give up like a few times</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">and then i was just like well okay i can</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">just treat this is basically evernote</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">but live like live in public</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">and an alt would probably even help more</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">with that because you&#39;re less afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">you&#39;re less that you&#39;re less attached to</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">um if you come into a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re like smearing or slandering like</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">people in other tribes people who you</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">not a fair depiction of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">right yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">so to answer the first part um</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">i mean like like i said i think it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">becomes um as</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">as you go from like blue pill to red</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">pill to gray pill it becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">more challenging to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">um to to feel connection with people</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">more traditional orientation to begin</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">with at least</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:29.920" style="s2">and then over time i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s become easier and easier</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.920" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">and why is that um</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">i mean for me actually i don&#39;t know if</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">prescription for everyone but for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">something that&#39;s helped</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">is just going deeper into my uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">meditation practice and also in</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">associate people with their particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">ideas um</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t see that as being representative</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">of them per se</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">um the way the way i interact with</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">people when i move through the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">is that sort of everyone is both this</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.079" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">god beast and a baby at the same time um</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">and those are all things worthy of uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">to borrow from c.s lewis worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">worship um</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">and if you i find that if i just focus</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">on those those</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">core parts that are worthy of worship</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">they can say whatever they want and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:28.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter i feel i feel a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">deep connection with them</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.800" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">um but then you i think you still need</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">to interact with that second layer that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">um because they&#39;re often you know going</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">to be directly insulting your friends</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">um you know like someone who i</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">spend time with nearly every day um</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">was talking about trump supporters the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">other day and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">talking about them as if they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">deserve to live like that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.200" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">um so in those cases i actually find</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">those as</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">i forget i think it was either peter or</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:01.280" style="s2">peter quoting jason</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">talking about the opportunity for shadow</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.280" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">work in these areas</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">um i find that there&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:07.680" style="s2">opportunities to do that sort of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">work in these areas like find</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.680" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">why am i triggered by them talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">this in this way to explore one&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">value set</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">but then furthermore i think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">really important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">how ideas interact with people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">general especially in these really</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">profound ways where they start to</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">their souls almost with the ideas um so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.960" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">i usually treat these as opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">to just ask them questions about their</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">and note along the way where i get</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">triggered which is useful information</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">you know if i for instance if i meet</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">someone who&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">all trump supporters should die or like</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">all billionaires should die</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">i i my reaction now is i try to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">actually pretty interested in that i</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have to believe that to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">i can be like huh so when you mean died</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">you mean like literally like</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">they should they should be killed and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">maybe they say yes i&#39;m like okay but how</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">should we send them to like should we</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">guillotine them</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re like well no i&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">should we uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know firing squads and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">like okay no not really that and like so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">by die maybe you don&#39;t mean literally</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">kill them you just mean that they&#39;re bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">and and it kind of helps me understand</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.760" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">um how the how the dialect and the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">interact with</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">their actual behavioral stances and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">preferences which to me is just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">fascinating opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">um understanding how human nature works</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">um and how human nature interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">so i i sort of do this duel thing where</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">um in terms of where the connection is i</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">feel the connection on the level</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">of the god the baby and the beast um but</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">that&#39;s but then but then on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">you can you can do this meta game as</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">peter might describe it of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">trying to understand like how do these</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">ideas operate in a human mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">um and maybe maybe there are things</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">about them that i missed</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">um like i would be pretty surprised if</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">i should come to believe that trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">supporters and billionaires should die</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">but maybe there are aspects of trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">supporters or billionaires that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">harmful for human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">that i had that i don&#39;t know about yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">and maybe i should try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">those because</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">certainly they&#39;re going to be other</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">examples in the world of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">particular instance um does that help</p>

<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:44.079" style="s2">about basically as a communication</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">revolution increases</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.079" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">uh only 60 of the world online now as</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">more people get online that part two was</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">which parts of kind of theory and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">techniques and tools</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">for synthesizing world views would be</p>

<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">so is the question um let me see if i</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">can restate it and if i understand it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">it something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">um right now not everyone is online but</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.319" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">a ton more people in perspective thus</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">perspectives and techniques and so on</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">will be online</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">how how would um something like the meta</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">tribe go about</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">understanding um how to prioritize</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">meaning making machine so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">tips yeah i could say a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">let me think for a moment uh peter do</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">you have anything that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">not at the moment i think yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">for some reason you know they&#39;re like i</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">said there there&#39;s so many things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">one could say here</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">but two things come most immediately to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">mind and i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">they&#39;re the best ones or</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">because they&#39;re just top of mind for</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">whatever reason i think both of them i</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">was talking about today so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">probably the actual reason which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">um one is um i got this from julia</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">gayliff actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">um julia gailiff is a podcaster in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">rationality movement</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">i think i think that&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">description and she has an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">podcast what is it called uh rationally</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.000" style="s2">um which is actually one of my entry</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">points before i even knew about</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">effective altruism or the rationality</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">movement i was listening to julia</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">gailiff</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">um and then um she</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">she had this practice that i that i</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">started adopting which is just noticing</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">your own confusion</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">um which sounds so simple and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">okay but that sounds really basic how is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">that even a technique but it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">like if if you start no if you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">really rigorously going throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">day noticing your</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">your own confusion you&#39;ll start noticing</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">most of the day you&#39;re actually confused</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">at least some part of you is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">um and you&#39;ll start noticing also this</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">counter force</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">to squash the confusion or pretend it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">not there</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">um so i think this is going to be one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">uh practices for the situation you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.640" style="s2">describe where now you&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">this greater and greater collision of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.640" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">more of a more globalized world where</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">all these ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">circulating and intermeshing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">opposing one another</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:27.200" style="s2">the temptation of a human mind that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">seeks coherence</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.200" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">can often just be try to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:35.119" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s really going on which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">sort of a one-size-fits-all</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.119" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">ideology that kind of explains away</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">everything else and that eventually just</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.119" style="s2">minimizes</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">confusion but at the cost</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.119" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">of constantly suppressing thoughts to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">um so i think basically what noticing or</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">confusion helps you do</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">helping a lot like even with little</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">things like the other day i wrote about</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">i drove to the grocery store and when i</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">parked i heard like a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">soft thump on the side of my seat and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">i looked down and</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">there was nothing there and so i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s weird and i walked out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">my car</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">until i realized oh and i said anomaly i</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">said it out loud but i didn&#39;t invest</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.920" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">curiosity in my own confusion there that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">there was just a random thump sound in</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">my car</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">and then as soon as i walked down my car</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">i realized and i was about to shut the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:57.359" style="s2">door</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">and i realized i left my keys in there</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.359" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">and i was about to lock myself</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">out and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">i looked under the seat and like lo and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">behold upon a second glance there</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">went where there were my keys but pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">much every time i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">said anomaly out loud and not</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">investigated i&#39;ve regretted it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">always been something like really</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:17.200" style="s2">important like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">and all the more important for these um</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">all-pervading</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">ideologies or world views that direct</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">almost all of our actions</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t notice anomalies with</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">those and and try to collapse your</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">kuni and paradigm or your your guiding</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">theory or guiding explanation or</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">the more you&#39;re going to be sucked into</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">a matrix of your own creation</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">so um i said i was going to say two but</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">i&#39;m already monologued on one so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">go with noticing your own confusion and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">like ryan said making it sexy which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:46.319" style="s2">even better</p>

<p begin="00:52:46.319" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">close out after after this and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.839" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">have a free associative conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">as being a facilitator i always check in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">with my body um</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">and then kind of check in with the field</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s like kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">ickiness uh going on in this session for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">me it&#39;s nothing to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">uh tyler but it felt like a masturbatory</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">this thing it&#39;s so abstract and i&#39;m like</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">yucky that made me think though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s no other memetic tribe that does</p>

<p begin="00:53:19.839" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2">himself a tribe really</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">and then has this kind of like hyper</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.040" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">analysis self-analysis on themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">right um so that&#39;s the tribe that goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">oh no are we being too tribal right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">yeah yeah and then by doing this makes</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">that gives that icy feeling makes me not</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">want to be a part of like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">meta tribe or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">um and and it&#39;s like you know when</p>

<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">phase that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">we have to have to go through together</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">in order to have like you know sex but</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">an ecology that they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">uh that they&#39;re just supporting</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">themselves with jokey memes or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">and then they&#39;re just warring outside of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">it so they&#39;re just really kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:10.720" style="s2">trying to fight for a map of reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">really and then not really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.720" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">questioning it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:17.839" style="s2">uh but whatever this meta tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:19.359" style="s2">is um doing that i i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.839" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">well you know it&#39;s funny to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.359" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">masturbation because</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:24.720" style="s2">okay please don&#39;t tweet what i&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">to say but it the thought came to mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.720" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">um something like a lot of the most</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">world-changing things are founded</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">upon some initial like group</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">masturbation which is basically you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">have to set the ground</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:37.839" style="s2">of what is this thing what are we all</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">talking about what do we share in common</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:41.520" style="s2">before actually turning your attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">toward doing stuff in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.520" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">and so the pretty much the only reason i</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">give a crap about</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">um the metatrade being a thing um as as</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">a thing that exists in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">i mean well for one it&#39;s just it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.839" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">good way to make friends</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">um who i get along with but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">you know my background is in effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">altruism and i still adhere</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">not necessarily to the mainstream effect</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">of altruism philosophy but at least to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">that my entire life is in service of all</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">sentient beings</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:14.880" style="s2">and so uh my interest is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">sort of setting a ground um</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.880" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">creating fertile ground for the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">and able to take that task on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">a pretty difficult</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">um gardening task um because i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">there are lots of iterations where even</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">if they&#39;re just a little bit off like</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">oops you ended up with communist russia</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:33.119" style="s2">and now like</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">tons of people are getting sent to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.119" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">gulags in the name of um</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">in the name of something that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:40.880" style="s2">originally like a beautiful ideal</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">i would rather not replicate that but in</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.880" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">order to not replicate those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">there does need to be this initial thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">which might kind of feel like oh how</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.040" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">many angels are dancing on the head of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">the pen</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:52.319" style="s2">um which is basically this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.319" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">the sort of masturbatory feeling thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">which is just defining like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:55:59.920" style="s2">what are we about</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">um who are our people um what is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.920" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">this thing what is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">and that can feel like just playing</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">insider baseball but i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">that&#39;s in my mind that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">necessary process but ideally it would</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">be done in tandem with</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">um something in more outward staring um</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">so i agree with you there</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not just uh like here at</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">the store we have all sorts of practices</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing that are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">you know dealing with the meta system</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">thinking so i think it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">combination all that stuff is needed</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.640" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s like socrates you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">like um he knows he knows nothing</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">and then the best life is the you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">the examine life</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s kind of what we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">to do here in the liminal so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">that being said i&#39;m going to stop um the</p>
