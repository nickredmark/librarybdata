<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:16.049" style="s2">systems goes back a long way with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">like I was a long haired hippie and a VW</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">eco communities when I first read about</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:28.859" style="s2">and but I feel like right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.269" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m so glad that we had this</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">already seeing in the in the wake of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.610" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">kovat 19 and the cascading synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">failure that is now rippling across the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:47.910" style="s2">globe we&#39;re seeing supply lines fail</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that local communities like</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.910" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">how brittle that that global economy was</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">or is how supply like just-in-time</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">production on the other side of the</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening all over and at</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">the same time over the last 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:12.600" style="s2">lots of organizations have started to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">home in on the bio regional scale being</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.600" end="00:01:17.430" style="s2">the scale where we can actually rematch</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">species and whether we&#39;re lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.689" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">that this global monster of of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">degenerative economy actually has</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">another 10 years so we have a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">software preparation of what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:39.509" style="s2">there are more pandemics and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">climate change disruption on the way in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.509" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">any case we need to prepare the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">regional exchange systems that you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">been working with for what 40 years by</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">now or 30 at least or 38 and a half okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">so I would love to just just basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">quietly listen to your wisdom of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">you would suggest and people can do and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">if you want we&#39;ve just talked a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">bit privately on my project in Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">if you want to make it concrete Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">but but you can talk about in general I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">think what what you&#39;re offering is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:14.550" style="s2">something that community</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:16.340" style="s2">is everywhere could really learn from so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.550" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">and over to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.340" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">well thank you Daniel thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">much generous and accurate summary of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:27.959" style="s2">much of my long history and a hippies</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:30.600" style="s2">traveling around the world and he W by</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.959" end="00:02:34.650" style="s2">season would like but we&#39;ve all brought</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.600" end="00:02:38.130" style="s2">up a lot in the last decades</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.650" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">particularly last few years and these</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.130" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">days I&#39;m focusing particularly on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">biomimicry circularity and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.100" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">responsibility accountability yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.459" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">island thing for instance you know at</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">the beginning of my exploration of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">issues I was coming across the what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">the island economy what if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:08.519" style="s2">comparative advantage of get your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:12.300" style="s2">from out there export the other you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.519" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">import/export from the island and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.300" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">very dangerous stuff you start importing</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:21.299" style="s2">stuff from other parts of the world well</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">any slightest idea of how it was made</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.299" end="00:03:27.180" style="s2">what it was made from the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">of the process how many intermediaries</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">were involved in this then the other and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:35.579" style="s2">we also export without the slightest</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.860" style="s2">idea of what we&#39;re doing with basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.579" end="00:03:41.609" style="s2">resources our futures our histories or</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">whatever and in a way an island and an</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.609" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">archipelago should be responsible for it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">it puts out in the world and what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">takes in from the world so increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:55.380" style="s2">what is our self-reliance it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.890" end="00:03:56.940" style="s2">self isolation it&#39;s not like our Island</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.380" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">nothing else out there</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.940" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">well it&#39;s about responsible contribution</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">input output transit balance and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">sending people stuff they need are we</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.649" end="00:05:44.699" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a patterning between the money</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.500" end="00:22:31.340" style="s2">remember and so there are many colonies</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.780" end="00:23:07.130" style="s2">supply of money and what do you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.690" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">supply of money seems to be very</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.130" end="00:23:11.330" style="s2">important to everything this is the</p>

<p begin="00:23:13.430" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">like when you don&#39;t have money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.740" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">worth anything anymore then then nobody</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.149" end="00:24:02.749" style="s2">like in this current situation when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:05.539" style="s2">when you think of communities really</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.749" end="00:24:07.820" style="s2">everywhere global north and global south</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.539" end="00:24:10.129" style="s2">beginning to seriously think how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.820" end="00:24:12.529" style="s2">avoid being quite so fragile in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.129" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">future and how would we regionalize our</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.529" end="00:24:16.610" style="s2">not initially our economy through</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:18.289" style="s2">through these kind of systems but</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.610" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">eventually also our assistance of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.289" end="00:24:23.929" style="s2">production and consumption and create</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:25.639" style="s2">more diverse regional economies and one</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.929" end="00:24:28.879" style="s2">of the things that I learned from you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.639" end="00:24:34.490" style="s2">mentioned him earlier banal Yatta</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.879" end="00:24:36.019" style="s2">is that he always told me that the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.490" end="00:24:39.830" style="s2">thing would be to have an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.019" end="00:24:41.629" style="s2">money systems you just also should every</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.830" end="00:24:43.549" style="s2">business needs to also still trade in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.629" end="00:24:45.559" style="s2">the international currency and only can</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.549" end="00:24:49.119" style="s2">take percentages of the local currency</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.559" end="00:24:51.889" style="s2">so which particular models would you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.119" end="00:24:55.100" style="s2">people should look into as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.889" end="00:24:57.619" style="s2">looking into creating more diverse local</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.100" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">and regional currencies and for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.619" end="00:25:01.879" style="s2">the like in an early exchange we</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:04.220" style="s2">mentioned the Swiss year system which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.879" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">more into business currency and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.220" end="00:25:09.619" style="s2">counter cyclical so if there if if Swiss</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:12.259" style="s2">alone is really doing well in the global</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.619" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">casino game then the veer almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.259" end="00:25:16.690" style="s2">disappears and when Switzerland has a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:19.940" style="s2">problem then the via comes back up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.690" end="00:25:23.619" style="s2">yeah which systems do you think are</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.940" end="00:25:28.490" style="s2">particularly I I&#39;m a believer in variety</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.619" end="00:25:33.169" style="s2">variety in the sense of ashbey&#39;s laws of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.490" end="00:25:35.659" style="s2">variety and systems theory that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.169" end="00:25:38.929" style="s2">complexity of that which you are engaged</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.659" end="00:25:41.119" style="s2">with and your tools for engaging those</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.929" end="00:25:45.289" style="s2">through complexity should match variety</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.119" end="00:25:47.419" style="s2">matching it used to be used to sail a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.289" end="00:25:50.090" style="s2">ship by telling the guy beside you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.419" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">move the wheel but you don&#39;t fly an</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:57.379" style="s2">you to move the stake you know the rate</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.139" end="00:25:59.330" style="s2">of complexity is different we&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.379" end="00:26:04.039" style="s2">economy in the world which is totally</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.330" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">inappropriate for a singular money now</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.039" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t have to argue</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">particularly what&#39;s right or wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.700" end="00:26:11.070" style="s2">sinking money in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:13.649" style="s2">the conventional single money is a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.070" end="00:26:17.070" style="s2">successful tool does exactly does it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.649" end="00:26:18.269" style="s2">competes of fuck out of it all puts its</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.070" end="00:26:24.299" style="s2">all of us on the treadmill</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.269" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">hallelujah run or die die die so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.299" end="00:26:29.149" style="s2">very successful in its way but it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">a big gap which is is that all we got</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.149" end="00:26:33.960" style="s2">can we also have these networks of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:36.299" style="s2">neighbourhood with without fighting it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.960" end="00:26:39.450" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t get in the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.299" end="00:26:41.309" style="s2">locomotive let&#39;s start these networks of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.450" end="00:26:46.109" style="s2">interaction and exchange in society</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.309" end="00:26:47.729" style="s2">community and many of them not one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.109" end="00:26:49.259" style="s2">been the biggest problem all the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.729" end="00:26:51.509" style="s2">through the development of LED systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.259" end="00:26:55.499" style="s2">was always a plural word by the way LED</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.509" end="00:26:57.629" style="s2">systems from 1983 was plural I think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.499" end="00:26:59.729" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get anybody to go plural in</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.629" end="00:27:00.679" style="s2">their systems they wanted to do one and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.729" end="00:27:03.599" style="s2">to get it right</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.679" end="00:27:06.179" style="s2">so they&#39;d and that meant that they set</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.599" end="00:27:10.609" style="s2">up a committee and a group and rewrite</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.179" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">all and you&#39;ve got to think about can</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.609" end="00:27:16.859" style="s2">about personal money issuing in these</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:19.619" style="s2">circles so when I spend money it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.859" end="00:27:21.479" style="s2">my level was down because I&#39;m pumping</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.619" end="00:27:23.820" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s going up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.479" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">and so the whole cloud run and then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:28.679" style="s2">percolates so somebody spends money so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.539" style="s2">think of a smoke ring right so your</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.679" end="00:27:35.279" style="s2">orange smoke ring for instance is your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.539" end="00:27:38.190" style="s2">region and it&#39;s got 10,000 people in it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:40.739" style="s2">in businesses and your training in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.190" end="00:27:42.809" style="s2">is substantial and in the businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.739" end="00:27:46.440" style="s2">it&#39;s of its own nature but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.809" end="00:27:49.019" style="s2">your locality a thousand people and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.440" end="00:27:51.749" style="s2">that&#39;s another little green cloud which</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.019" end="00:27:53.190" style="s2">is in the same place it&#39;s just sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.749" end="00:27:55.379" style="s2">you&#39;re singing green and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.190" end="00:27:59.429" style="s2">you&#39;re singing or and all of them have</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.379" end="00:28:04.440" style="s2">this resurgence recirculation effect in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.429" end="00:28:06.539" style="s2">them which is not controlled so some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.440" end="00:28:09.059" style="s2">these are time banks in my neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.539" end="00:28:13.409" style="s2">a time bank you know 20 people or a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.059" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">childcare balancing act so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.409" end="00:28:18.389" style="s2">about having the currency it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:21.539" style="s2">having the opportunity to have as many</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.389" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">currencies for my expression and count</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.539" end="00:28:26.009" style="s2">you should as I&#39;m deal with and play</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:28.409" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.009" end="00:28:31.649" style="s2">this is this is a key point there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.409" end="00:28:35.009" style="s2">because I&#39;m just wondering whether it</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.649" end="00:28:38.190" style="s2">takes a special sort of person know who</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.009" end="00:28:40.409" style="s2">is kind of the of the frugal type and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.190" end="00:28:42.269" style="s2">the systemic understanding type that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.409" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">says well I really want to support my</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.269" end="00:28:47.519" style="s2">local community and it all makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:48.989" style="s2">and so they have this wallet which they</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.519" end="00:28:50.489" style="s2">have like their normal County and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.989" end="00:28:53.789" style="s2">have that one and then I have that one</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.489" end="00:28:57.139" style="s2">and because it&#39;s a bit complicated when</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.789" end="00:28:57.139" style="s2">I have to make the mentally ready</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.009" end="00:29:04.619" style="s2">how do you get around that well um I</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.559" end="00:29:09.929" style="s2">mean there&#39;s so many parts in that in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.619" end="00:29:17.399" style="s2">way first of all the the if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.929" end="00:29:20.429" style="s2">bills to $10 $20 52 identical bills and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.399" end="00:29:23.099" style="s2">for some reason you&#39;ve made a mark on</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.429" end="00:29:25.649" style="s2">one and that one when you spend it</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.099" end="00:29:28.200" style="s2">somehow rather it will come back this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.649" end="00:29:30.239" style="s2">one never will you know this one when</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.200" end="00:29:37.470" style="s2">you spend it it&#39;s a goner right this one</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.239" end="00:29:40.049" style="s2">might which we spend first along they</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:44.800" style="s2">struck and so the banks couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.610" end="00:32:46.550" style="s2">reconcile there were local accounts you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.800" end="00:32:49.310" style="s2">know what paper was and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.550" end="00:32:54.920" style="s2">so that to close their doors so nobody</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.120" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">so France froze the Irish on the other</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.890" end="00:33:19.970" style="s2">sorts of things that you were using them</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:22.370" style="s2">to pay off other people well that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.970" end="00:33:25.340" style="s2">the first phase and it worked that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.370" end="00:33:28.910" style="s2">was stiff the second phase of the strike</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.340" end="00:33:31.520" style="s2">because it lasted two months broke and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.910" end="00:33:34.610" style="s2">then restarted the second phase one for</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.520" end="00:33:36.980" style="s2">about nine months I believe and what was</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.610" end="00:33:40.730" style="s2">happening was that certain employers</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.980" end="00:33:42.170" style="s2">were paying their their paychecks non</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.730" end="00:33:43.910" style="s2">cash because he didn&#39;t have it nobody</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.910" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">paycheck but rather make it 147 pound</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:55.280" style="s2">they do five checks of 20 hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:34:02.180" style="s2">vortex of ten and the leaders in this</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.230" end="00:37:12.170" style="s2">had before and that that&#39;s a probably a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.240" end="00:37:16.310" style="s2">good thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.170" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2">but if I now think of the future here in</p>

<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">talking about creating a basic income</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.150" end="00:37:31.220" style="s2">like universal basic income and rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:33.500" style="s2">than having these people wait until the</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.260" end="00:38:07.550" style="s2">period of time and there takes them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.940" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">a beautiful thing to do it&#39;s hard work</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.550" end="00:38:14.510" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s rewarding and how would</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:19.340" style="s2">you see a system okay if that then</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.510" end="00:38:21.740" style="s2">bought them local food well the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.340" end="00:38:24.710" style="s2">matter that I&#39;m recommending at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.740" end="00:38:26.510" style="s2">point or drafting round and recommending</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.710" end="00:38:29.660" style="s2">because I mean tell me much about it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.510" end="00:38:32.630" style="s2">that governments are offering quick</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.660" end="00:38:34.610" style="s2">fixes and loans lot of small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.630" end="00:38:37.990" style="s2">are invited to take up loans in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.610" end="00:38:41.030" style="s2">you&#39;re inviting 30 $40,000 with long</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.990" end="00:38:42.890" style="s2">with the expectation that a component</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.030" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">will be forgivable or will get the rest</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.890" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">later hmm do I want to take on a $30,000</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">loan in my business at this point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:56.930" style="s2">gonna is you know I can&#39;t paint now</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:39:00.140" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to pay a fee or so so my</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.930" end="00:39:02.630" style="s2">suggestion is take the loan and then put</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.140" end="00:39:05.000" style="s2">the money in a bank account in common</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.630" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">with 20 other businesses and use that as</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.000" end="00:39:12.250" style="s2">the backing for a standard cash back</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:16.310" style="s2">currency nice one that is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.250" end="00:39:18.170" style="s2">it&#39;s just yeah notes are available all</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.310" end="00:39:20.570" style="s2">over Europe already it&#39;s a community</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.170" end="00:39:23.270" style="s2">that&#39;s a really nice idea because we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.570" end="00:39:25.130" style="s2">know that the businesses are keen on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.270" end="00:39:25.800" style="s2">cash back currency I mean even in</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.130" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">Bristol</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.800" end="00:39:32.700" style="s2">yeah versus they say it&#39;s no use but we</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:33.780" style="s2">take it finally take it because if they</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.700" end="00:39:36.390" style="s2">don&#39;t take it the customer goes</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.780" end="00:39:37.710" style="s2">somewhere else do they take it and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:39.620" style="s2">just take it straight to the bank and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.710" end="00:39:42.030" style="s2">get their ninety five pence in the pound</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.620" end="00:39:44.820" style="s2">you know so you don&#39;t think it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.030" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">they just have to use it yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.820" end="00:39:48.210" style="s2">willing to use it because they know</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:51.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a cash backing on the full</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.210" end="00:39:52.860" style="s2">invoice the full acceptance now if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.030" end="00:39:54.450" style="s2">want people to just go for this and take</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.860" end="00:39:56.580" style="s2">it for granted and see it as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.450" end="00:40:00.150" style="s2">thing then full acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.580" end="00:40:02.550" style="s2">bing-bong and the means of doing it like</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.150" end="00:40:06.510" style="s2">we can do with our software prints the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.550" end="00:40:09.900" style="s2">money basically these days but so does</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:11.850" style="s2">any ticketing system and you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.900" end="00:40:14.610" style="s2">all on accounts you know you can set up</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.850" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">a swipe or a switch or a tap or and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.610" end="00:40:18.750" style="s2">was no trouble these days I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">a lot of the things I&#39;m really focusing</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.750" end="00:40:26.850" style="s2">on it more there&#39;s two aspects to my</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:28.620" style="s2">strategy one is essentially we&#39;re all we</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.850" end="00:40:30.210" style="s2">could all use a money that helped us out</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.620" end="00:40:32.370" style="s2">in addition to the shit that goes</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.210" end="00:40:35.370" style="s2">through you know we know this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.370" end="00:40:39.600" style="s2">we&#39;re surviving it if we can or not why</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.370" end="00:40:41.400" style="s2">not have this as well you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.600" end="00:40:42.900" style="s2">an acceptable I&#39;m going to everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.400" end="00:40:48.540" style="s2">acceptable - enough that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.900" end="00:40:52.620" style="s2">generate the concept and whatever lot&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.540" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">of luck my friend but the pervasiveness</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.620" end="00:40:59.850" style="s2">of this oh yeah there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">unthought it&#39;s like when you get people</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.850" end="00:41:05.450" style="s2">on a bicycle first if they thought about</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.490" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">getting on the bicycle they wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.450" end="00:41:12.510" style="s2">mean it&#39;s difficult obviously gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:15.450" style="s2">over of fries hard maybe it&#39;ll stay in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.510" end="00:41:17.130" style="s2">line or something you when they get on</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.450" end="00:41:18.810" style="s2">the bicycle and move to get it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.130" end="00:41:21.780" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to be given a currency that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.810" end="00:41:23.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t think about but we just fits</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.780" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">in usefully and creates circularity</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.460" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">sorry I know I just I just had another</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:29.610" style="s2">fault but then I already had the father</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:31.110" style="s2">of white my book works well anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.610" end="00:41:33.270" style="s2">it would have worked brilliantly before</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.110" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">on the basis of what you just said well</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.270" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">okay we have this special thing actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.540" style="s2">lots of people have these tourist tax in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">local tourist</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.540" end="00:41:43.740" style="s2">and and and so basically people arrived</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:45.150" style="s2">they&#39;ve paid for their hotels but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.740" end="00:41:47.900" style="s2">when they arrive at the hotel they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.150" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">all asked to pay another dollar fifty or</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.900" end="00:41:54.300" style="s2">euro fifty and that then becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:57.360" style="s2">what&#39;s called the Eco tax which</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.300" end="00:41:59.580" style="s2">supposedly is invested in sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.360" end="00:42:01.560" style="s2">things around the island but if if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.580" end="00:42:03.240" style="s2">had or if they in the future even in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.560" end="00:42:05.910" style="s2">reduced tourism that we might get in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.240" end="00:42:09.030" style="s2">future and would take that money and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.910" end="00:42:11.940" style="s2">directly put it into such a cash back</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.030" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2">fund for been a much more agile local</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.940" end="00:42:18.900" style="s2">currency you&#39;d multiply the money coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:22.500" style="s2">in massively it&#39;s not just multiply its</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.900" end="00:42:23.940" style="s2">capture it&#39;s like the swales you know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.500" end="00:42:26.850" style="s2">you&#39;re in a permaculture you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.940" end="00:42:29.400" style="s2">watershed wash off and so you build</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.850" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">banks and you try and catch the water</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.400" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">they know it so well when people talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:39.300" style="s2">about capturing or multipliers with</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:41.010" style="s2">conventional money i I just disregard</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.300" end="00:42:43.170" style="s2">that because frankly it&#39;s like a spin</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.010" end="00:42:43.860" style="s2">dryer the money goes around every time</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.170" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">it&#39;s spent</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.860" end="00:42:49.770" style="s2">it&#39;s sheds food cost of goods tax</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:50.790" style="s2">whatever and so money is not containable</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.770" end="00:42:53.400" style="s2">conventional money you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.790" end="00:42:55.230" style="s2">containable but when you have a local</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.400" end="00:42:59.430" style="s2">currency it doesn&#39;t have a multiplier</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.230" end="00:43:03.780" style="s2">effect it is a persistence effect it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.430" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t multiply it just is slow it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.780" end="00:43:08.760" style="s2">spread it synced proponents what water</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">mantra actually works for money - yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.760" end="00:43:16.830" style="s2">yes in place you looted and it still can</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:20.090" style="s2">have it and having it is is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.830" end="00:43:22.470" style="s2">Commons of money this is free speech</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.090" end="00:43:25.400" style="s2">these are our ability to declare our</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.470" end="00:43:28.350" style="s2">money by our promise and our fulfillment</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.400" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">one thing past you that it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.350" end="00:43:33.840" style="s2">idea that I had just after I published</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:36.360" style="s2">my book and then for a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.840" end="00:43:38.310" style="s2">because I&#39;m not that geeky and I hate</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.360" end="00:43:41.340" style="s2">accounting and I had bureaucracy I I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.310" end="00:43:43.800" style="s2">never really pushed that I pursued it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.340" end="00:43:45.930" style="s2">but I I talked to a lot of people that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.800" end="00:43:47.790" style="s2">believe some of them kind of ran with</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.930" end="00:43:51.299" style="s2">power of the idea which is great that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.790" end="00:43:53.880" style="s2">was the the intention and basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.299" end="00:43:56.219" style="s2">and and it might be flawed but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.880" end="00:43:59.369" style="s2">the idea I was sort of thinking how</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.219" end="00:44:04.649" style="s2">would we if the current monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.369" end="00:44:07.709" style="s2">is built on a zero-sum game that needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.649" end="00:44:09.419" style="s2">winners and losers that that needs us to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.709" end="00:44:11.009" style="s2">exploit each other and exploit the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.419" end="00:44:13.199" style="s2">planet for the whole thing to keep going</p>

<p begin="00:52:18.460" end="00:52:22.869" style="s2">to experiment with this in my community</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.049" end="00:52:27.549" style="s2">in where would you send them as a sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.869" end="00:52:33.489" style="s2">of resource website or book to read or</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.549" end="00:52:35.890" style="s2">person&#39;s work to follow the the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.489" end="00:52:37.650" style="s2">place to go is check out our software</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.890" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">and try it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.650" end="00:52:48.430" style="s2">the place I&#39;d send for that yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">got to identify an entry point that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.430" end="00:52:54.640" style="s2">would be effective at this point I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:58.360" style="s2">put a cover page and open money door CC</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">open money god CC will give an entry</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.360" end="00:53:03.130" style="s2">point to whatever is comments with this</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:05.710" style="s2">process we are in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.130" end="00:53:08.950" style="s2">revising our stuff in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.710" end="00:53:11.950" style="s2">because there&#39;s 20 years and websites</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.950" end="00:53:14.260" style="s2">and that us finds 25 years of websites</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.950" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s fine plus much more before</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.260" end="00:53:21.370" style="s2">that I&#39;m just trying to there&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:23.260" style="s2">think a uk-based website something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.370" end="00:53:26.770" style="s2">complimentary alternative currencies not</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.260" end="00:53:29.230" style="s2">called UK it has a huge range of did you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.770" end="00:53:31.810" style="s2">know which one I mean can you see I a I</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.230" end="00:53:35.100" style="s2">think it&#39;s CCI a community currencies in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.810" end="00:53:44.460" style="s2">action it was a European funded report</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.100" end="00:53:44.460" style="s2">Leonardo belt and it&#39;s it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.990" end="00:53:55.320" style="s2">see so much money was poured into bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.790" end="00:53:59.560" style="s2">ideas so much expert complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.320" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">confusion you know the Snowden work on</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.560" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">connivin the framework of change and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.110" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">people brought complicated experts to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.410" end="00:54:15.370" style="s2">satisfy government grant and you ended</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:18.760" style="s2">up with bad ideas that persisted because</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.370" end="00:54:19.800" style="s2">they were funded and had no no</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.760" end="00:54:24.790" style="s2">functional output</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.800" end="00:54:28.020" style="s2">no no product of any valuable but yet</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.790" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">were supported for various reasons of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.020" end="00:54:34.030" style="s2">conventional wisdom now we need an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.900" end="00:54:37.990" style="s2">unconventional wisdom here I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.030" end="00:54:40.600" style="s2">I did you know I was just I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.990" end="00:54:42.670" style="s2">was just going to Korea to speak at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.600" end="00:54:45.550" style="s2">conference on basic income did I mention</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.670" end="00:54:48.850" style="s2">that before I think alive email yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.550" end="00:54:50.710" style="s2">yeah okay well explicitly it was out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.850" end="00:54:53.380" style="s2">my field but suddenly was come</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.710" end="00:54:56.530" style="s2">career addresses conference on I said</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.380" end="00:54:59.020" style="s2">I&#39;ll come but no use for two days I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.530" end="00:55:00.609" style="s2">be jet-lagged and stupid so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.020" end="00:55:02.349" style="s2">bring me a week early and stay a week</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.609" end="00:55:05.260" style="s2">then I can probably do a few things and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.349" end="00:55:07.300" style="s2">we&#39;ll share ideas and whatever and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.260" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">they really gave me the red carpet they</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.300" end="00:55:12.099" style="s2">set up a workshop with a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:14.349" style="s2">government officials currency activists</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.099" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">and academics that was what they said</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.349" end="00:55:18.520" style="s2">they were going to do on the fly I gives</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:21.190" style="s2">a three-hour workshop for you two to run</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.520" end="00:55:23.830" style="s2">so I was very excited about that until</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.190" end="00:55:26.830" style="s2">the day before I flew they said don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.830" end="00:55:28.930" style="s2">and that was very disappointing until I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.830" end="00:55:31.240" style="s2">thought damn that&#39;s such an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.930" end="00:55:34.119" style="s2">because if they&#39;ve gone I would have</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.240" end="00:55:35.830" style="s2">made a mess of the presentation my slide</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.119" end="00:55:38.830" style="s2">through the works I don&#39;t speak Korean</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.830" end="00:55:40.540" style="s2">and it means you know who knows you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.830" end="00:55:42.190" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t go you can put all</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.540" end="00:55:44.820" style="s2">that time and energy into telling what</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.190" end="00:55:48.010" style="s2">you would have done if you had gone yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.820" end="00:55:53.140" style="s2">so what I&#39;m doing now is basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.010" end="00:55:55.270" style="s2">preparing a set of documents and I will</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.140" end="00:56:00.099" style="s2">put the link to this on Monday not see</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.270" end="00:56:02.800" style="s2">see today&#39;s it&#39;s a framework that places</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.099" end="00:56:06.339" style="s2">the ideas of community currency in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.800" end="00:56:09.460" style="s2">logos level the logic the theory the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.339" end="00:56:12.040" style="s2">Greek level if you like and then moves</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.460" end="00:56:16.839" style="s2">into the Latin of functionality and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.040" end="00:56:19.960" style="s2">activity what you can do as a template</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.839" end="00:56:21.700" style="s2">said here&#39;s a procedure which with</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.960" end="00:56:24.820" style="s2">modification can be applied at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.700" end="00:56:27.130" style="s2">village the town the city whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.820" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">know lots of variants in there five</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.130" end="00:56:32.920" style="s2">flexibility but it&#39;s based upon business</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.490" end="00:56:34.930" style="s2">issuing money through covalent to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.920" end="00:56:38.619" style="s2">support community and that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.930" end="00:56:40.810" style="s2">turbine now that&#39;s the basic model now</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.619" end="00:56:44.800" style="s2">what are we doing with that basic model</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.810" end="00:56:46.930" style="s2">ah well what we want to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.800" end="00:56:51.330" style="s2">basic model is it&#39;s sort of expression</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.930" end="00:56:55.570" style="s2">over the third level is a multimedia</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.330" end="00:57:00.520" style="s2">international project of information</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.570" end="00:57:02.920" style="s2">education and mutual benefit with</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.520" end="00:57:03.500" style="s2">funding available from all over the</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.500" end="00:57:10.910" style="s2">and focus points for the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.970" end="00:57:13.700" style="s2">basically narratives of change this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.910" end="00:57:17.630" style="s2">sounds so much like it would actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.700" end="00:57:20.150" style="s2">mean something that would be of value to</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.630" end="00:57:23.480" style="s2">that network that is still relatively</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.150" end="00:57:25.430" style="s2">fledgling at the moment that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.480" end="00:57:27.050" style="s2">incubated out of the capital Institute</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.430" end="00:57:29.690" style="s2">and with the world under done</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.050" end="00:57:31.450" style="s2">regenerative economics it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.690" end="00:57:35.780" style="s2">regenerative communities Network and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.450" end="00:57:38.750" style="s2">it&#39;s basically a number of pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.780" end="00:57:41.900" style="s2">capable or very capable and committed</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.750" end="00:57:44.120" style="s2">players at a regional scale saying we</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.900" end="00:57:46.700" style="s2">want to sign up to you at this point</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.120" end="00:57:49.880" style="s2">kind of intentional network of creating</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.700" end="00:57:53.140" style="s2">an example of a bio regional economic</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.880" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">system and and there they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.140" end="00:57:57.590" style="s2">finding their feet with it but some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:58:01.450" style="s2">them are strong partners like as the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.590" end="00:58:04.460" style="s2">Hudson Valley region which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.450" end="00:58:07.430" style="s2">preaching that is playing with it but in</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.460" end="00:58:11.150" style="s2">this part of Costa Rica and and the mom</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.430" end="00:58:13.100" style="s2">the users they&#39;ve generally left</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.150" end="00:58:15.020" style="s2">themselves with the difficulty of still</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.100" end="00:58:18.020" style="s2">operating in the same model as a</p>

<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:26.750" style="s2">even there yet but what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.170" end="00:58:29.570" style="s2">describing this this mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.750" end="00:58:31.970" style="s2">they could then engage local businesses</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.570" end="00:58:34.130" style="s2">and local charities into a wider</p>

<p begin="00:58:34.130" end="00:58:40.070" style="s2">that we&#39;ve just we&#39;ve got a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.050" end="00:58:43.880" style="s2">here where people can as they buy commit</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.070" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">to their local region and to social and</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.750" end="00:58:55.010" style="s2">really powerful and I&#39;ll put you in</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.100" end="00:58:57.290" style="s2">touch with Stuart Cohen too because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.010" end="00:59:00.470" style="s2">think you love to chat with these people</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.290" end="00:59:03.320" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got the gist of it very</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.470" end="00:59:06.080" style="s2">accurately you write on it right on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.320" end="00:59:08.420" style="s2">money one might save it and return your</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.080" end="00:59:12.080" style="s2">attention to the specifics that in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.420" end="00:59:14.080" style="s2">portfolio of local resources hmm it</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.080" end="00:59:17.170" style="s2">could be a whole host of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.080" end="00:59:19.030" style="s2">academic artistic individuals you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.170" end="00:59:20.500" style="s2">this person needs a year off to write a</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.500" end="00:59:26.830" style="s2">person needs to go and study that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.090" end="00:59:29.650" style="s2">they could be equally funded what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.830" end="00:59:34.330" style="s2">calling a cooperative patreon a cult</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.650" end="00:59:36.130" style="s2">patronage that&#39;s needed yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.330" end="00:59:37.780" style="s2">no different from patreon accepted</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.130" end="00:59:40.840" style="s2">instead of being offered a t-shirt or</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.780" end="00:59:42.940" style="s2">the five or six options you you know all</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.840" end="00:59:46.150" style="s2">of which tend to drag down the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.940" end="00:59:50.200" style="s2">beneficiary a bit of a cost on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.150" end="00:59:52.900" style="s2">benefit yeah if it was just you put you</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.200" end="00:59:56.470" style="s2">know 500 bucks behind this guy and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.900" end="01:00:00.580" style="s2">get $500 that work in these businesses</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.470" end="01:00:03.130" style="s2">when I finally caved just less than two</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.580" end="01:00:05.230" style="s2">weeks ago and set up my friend because</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.130" end="01:00:08.220" style="s2">of this situation just making it</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.220" end="01:00:12.310" style="s2">really resisted be like I watched all</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.050" end="01:00:14.530" style="s2">these videos how do you create your</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.310" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">patreon account it was soon it was all</p>

<p begin="01:04:00.430" end="01:04:07.710" style="s2">need an awful lot of additional work to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.740" end="01:04:10.600" style="s2">look as good as the usual contenders so</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.710" end="01:04:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a consciousness experience for</p>

<p begin="01:04:23.590" end="01:04:27.310" style="s2">explaining it to them they feel somebody</p>

<p begin="01:04:27.310" end="01:04:37.380" style="s2">should I end the process of the ego-mind</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:44.230" style="s2">so so I think we we probably better</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:47.410" style="s2">bring that to a close otherwise nobody</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.230" end="01:04:51.280" style="s2">watch any of it it&#39;s true I really</p>

<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:18.790" style="s2">a couple of months or so have another</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.230" end="01:05:20.440" style="s2">conversation because there&#39;s one burning</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.790" end="01:05:22.770" style="s2">question that I agree we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.440" end="01:05:25.180" style="s2">necessarily dive into now but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.770" end="01:05:28.260" style="s2">because it will open up another hour and</p>
