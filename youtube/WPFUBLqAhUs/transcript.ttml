<p begin="00:00:05.339" end="00:00:09.269" style="s2">again and we&#39;ve been having these</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.960" end="00:00:12.509" style="s2">wonderful conversations with Bill Reid</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.269" end="00:00:15.560" style="s2">and Ben Haggard and Bill sharp yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.509" end="00:00:18.690" style="s2">been really stimulating and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.560" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">so the alchemy of ideas coming together</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.690" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">for me it&#39;s been it been greatest the h3</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:27.330" style="s2">uni tribe in the IFF tribe join with</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">with the Regenesis tribe because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.330" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">always felt that and they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">somewhat drinking from similar fountains</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.410" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of overlap as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">discovering in the conversations but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.410" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">focus of this call and and also this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">this recording is that I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:48.239" style="s2">learn more and also share with people</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">listening the structure and the content</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.239" end="00:00:51.719" style="s2">of the course on facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">transformational journeys that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.719" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">been putting together within h3 Union</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">and it just looks wonderful and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">starts on May 20th and could you just</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">tell me talk me through that the seven</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">sessions of this course a little bit yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy to but before I do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">I&#39;d just like to set the scene a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">bit um as you know and hopefully at</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">least some of your readers will know</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:30.049" style="s2">that h3 uni is set up an online resource</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">library in which a number of methods of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.049" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">facilitation and co-creative cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">are codified so that they become tools</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">that people can use for new kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">meeting that are acknowledging it at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">very start that this is a voyage into</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">the unknown and we have to create our</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">future as much as monitor what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">on and respond to it so the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:10.880" style="s2">with such a resource library is of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:15.070" style="s2">course it&#39;s uni-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.880" end="00:02:17.780" style="s2">and particularly with the legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.070" end="00:02:21.170" style="s2">analytical thinking that&#39;s throughout</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.780" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">society there&#39;s always a danger of there</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.170" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">being a tool trap that we think if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.110" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">got the tool we&#39;ve got the skill to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">it so what I&#39;m setting out to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:40.010" style="s2">course is to share some of them all</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">subtle unless easy aspects of getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.010" end="00:02:45.500" style="s2">the best out of the methods and to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:51.160" style="s2">keep that simple if you can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.500" end="00:02:51.160" style="s2">as excuse me three overlapping circles</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.450" end="00:02:58.820" style="s2">one circle is the existential by which I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">mean the challenges that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.820" end="00:03:05.230" style="s2">goggle problem Artie whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:09.140" style="s2">focused on climate change or bio</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.230" end="00:03:13.550" style="s2">recovery or urban development whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.140" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">it is it&#39;s all part of the big system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.550" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">planet Earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.660" end="00:03:20.210" style="s2">and so even very local initiatives have</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">to take account of the whole and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.210" end="00:03:25.910" style="s2">certainly had that robbed in more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:29.810" style="s2">our faces through the kovat 19 of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.910" end="00:03:32.200" style="s2">pandemic the second circle is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:34.730" style="s2">methodology itself and here the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.200" end="00:03:41.230" style="s2">important thing is that the methods that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.730" end="00:03:46.070" style="s2">have got us to here through in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.230" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">non-systemic conceptual and practical</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.070" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">tools are unsuitable for getting us into</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">this new world of synergy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.410" style="s2">interconnectedness so the toolkit we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:03:59.959" style="s2">assembled and it&#39;s going to be growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.410" end="00:04:03.500" style="s2">over the years as well is it all</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.959" end="00:04:07.640" style="s2">directed towards connected patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.500" end="00:04:14.660" style="s2">REE patterning things to just excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.640" end="00:04:17.630" style="s2">a moment the the third circle is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.660" end="00:04:20.630" style="s2">personal which is basically the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.630" end="00:04:24.650" style="s2">that if we&#39;re going to help transform</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.630" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">the world we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.650" end="00:04:29.740" style="s2">to also and immediately transform</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">ourselves and that gets us into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.740" end="00:04:36.949" style="s2">interesting area of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">development whichever form we&#39;re taken</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.949" end="00:04:42.889" style="s2">up within I think that if we ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:47.240" style="s2">can&#39;t observe ourselves change our way</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.889" end="00:04:49.130" style="s2">of even belief systems then we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.240" end="00:04:51.470" style="s2">to kid ourselves about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.130" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">transformation effect so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.470" end="00:04:57.160" style="s2">transformation effect in our view comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:05:00.380" style="s2">together when these three circles</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.160" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">coincide and then an interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.380" end="00:05:06.260" style="s2">chemistry or alchemy takes place so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">hope to give a flavor of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.260" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">course so the next step in into the into</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2">the course itself is just simply looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">at this way that on the one hand we live</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:23.090" style="s2">on planet earth with a biosphere and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:25.820" style="s2">the other living and material</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.090" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">complications and on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.820" end="00:05:33.910" style="s2">live in a human world and historically</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:36.260" style="s2">these two are separate disjunct and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.910" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">particularly the one exploiting the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.260" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">other the humans as parasites rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:49.070" style="s2">than as members of the living system and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:53.900" style="s2">to bring these together we need some</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.070" end="00:05:57.590" style="s2">kind of a bridge so the idea of the of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.900" end="00:06:03.139" style="s2">the course is that it&#39;s built around</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.590" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">five arches or steps in this bridge the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.139" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">first one is understanding the world the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:11.660" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:15.470" style="s2">where we are and this is based on a tool</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.660" end="00:06:17.720" style="s2">that I now call the world mandala it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.470" end="00:06:20.210" style="s2">used to be called the world system model</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.720" end="00:06:22.310" style="s2">and it still is in a sense but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.210" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">bring out with the word mandala that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.310" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">it&#39;s much more about directing our inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:34.690" style="s2">attention to things rather than doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">systems thinking in the more linear</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.690" end="00:06:39.890" style="s2">deterministic way it&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.940" end="00:06:42.260" style="s2">patterns of connection that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.890" end="00:06:45.380" style="s2">important and we&#39;ve seen a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.260" end="00:06:50.210" style="s2">come out inadvertently for us in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.380" end="00:06:52.040" style="s2">pandemic so if you&#39;ve got a project you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.210" end="00:06:53.810" style="s2">need to look at it in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.040" end="00:06:56.300" style="s2">world this helps you to do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:06:59.000" style="s2">having done that you&#39;re then faced with</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.300" end="00:07:01.700" style="s2">a considerable complexity more than we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.000" end="00:07:04.640" style="s2">used to normally handling so you need a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.700" end="00:07:08.120" style="s2">tool for that and this is where the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.640" end="00:07:10.850" style="s2">of what we call hexagon clustering comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.120" end="00:07:13.970" style="s2">in the idea of the hexagon is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.850" end="00:07:16.190" style="s2">six-sided object and normally when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.970" end="00:07:18.710" style="s2">work with ideas we list them and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.190" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">have no connections or we draw a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.710" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">balloons in a few lines and call it a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:27.560" style="s2">system the beauty of the hexagon is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:30.500" style="s2">multivalent you can have up to six</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.560" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">connections of any idea or piece of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.500" end="00:07:38.600" style="s2">information with any other of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:41.180" style="s2">some people will say well why only six</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.600" end="00:07:46.820" style="s2">and the answer is if somebody can show</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.180" end="00:07:49.460" style="s2">me a a tile that will tessellate with</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:51.770" style="s2">more than six connections I&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.460" end="00:07:55.220" style="s2">interested but that&#39;s the geometry of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.770" end="00:07:57.140" style="s2">the universe that we have also since we</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.220" end="00:08:00.020" style="s2">normally work in checklists which have</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.140" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">no valency at all and this is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.020" end="00:08:05.620" style="s2">step forward now when we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:09.530" style="s2">clustered information it&#39;s qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.620" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not arrived at by big data type</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.530" end="00:08:16.130" style="s2">methodology it&#39;s arrived up by conscious</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:20.030" style="s2">perception we can then say okay how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.130" end="00:08:22.790" style="s2">we want to get through to a decent</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.030" end="00:08:25.310" style="s2">future through this complexity and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.790" end="00:08:27.470" style="s2">leads us into the next tool which is the</p>

<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:38.580" style="s2">here I just wanted to share with you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">something that happened to me personally</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.580" end="00:09:46.980" style="s2">with regard to to three horizons lately</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:49.560" style="s2">is that I&#39;ve certainly seen that the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.980" end="00:09:53.100" style="s2">framing of the first and the third</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.560" end="00:09:56.790" style="s2">horizon is very similar to Janna Macy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.100" end="00:09:59.460" style="s2">wonderful framing of having to hospice</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.790" end="00:10:02.550" style="s2">the old system out of existence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.460" end="00:10:03.780" style="s2">Midwife the new system into existing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.550" end="00:10:05.790" style="s2">that&#39;s the great transition in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.780" end="00:10:08.100" style="s2">in-between which is there that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.790" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">second horizon and for me it was just</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.100" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">powerful to put those like the D</p>

<p begin="00:10:12.600" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">because what you were just starting with</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.190" end="00:10:18.900" style="s2">is to say those two systems the human</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:22.400" style="s2">system and the buyers system have never</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.900" end="00:10:25.740" style="s2">been separate but the big journey is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.400" end="00:10:27.900" style="s2">heal the unbroken whole and and I and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.740" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s how it actually Maps</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.900" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">perfectly on the work that reconnects</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:35.660" style="s2">and even if if most people look at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.840" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">three horizon model as something may be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.660" end="00:10:41.820" style="s2">much more mental and less emotional but</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:46.500" style="s2">it is actually no it&#39;s it&#39;s hugely</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.820" end="00:10:48.180" style="s2">emotional in practice if applied you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.500" end="00:10:50.940" style="s2">know it really challenges our belief</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:03.570" style="s2">I&#39;d put on your observation is that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.660" end="00:11:04.620" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s as well as the</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.990" end="00:11:32.940" style="s2">role I find that that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">very often when I work with the three</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:48.420" style="s2">about the third horizon and to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.040" end="00:11:50.730" style="s2">look at the red line at the bottom right</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.730" end="00:11:54.900" style="s2">line is still here the old system</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.900" end="00:11:58.680" style="s2">we value and we want to keep it keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.760" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">having people people really kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.680" end="00:12:03.330" style="s2">oh wow okay that&#39;s a question of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:04.620" style="s2">ask myself and it&#39;s a vital question</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.330" end="00:12:06.570" style="s2">because otherwise we throw out the baby</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.240" end="00:16:29.770" style="s2">sorry yeah well know that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.970" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">good point because that experience is</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.770" end="00:16:35.529" style="s2">why what I call the third circle of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.190" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">personal development is so critical that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.529" end="00:16:44.200" style="s2">if you know our education is very much</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:46.150" style="s2">based on I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong or if</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.200" end="00:16:48.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a question there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.150" end="00:16:53.170" style="s2">answer and there&#39;s an expert who knows</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.730" end="00:16:56.500" style="s2">it and so kind of what our educational</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.170" end="00:17:00.010" style="s2">mission is is to open up that as you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.500" end="00:17:03.870" style="s2">the the whole world that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.010" end="00:17:09.459" style="s2">intelligent questioning that we need and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.870" end="00:17:12.189" style="s2">to play down the right answer I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.459" end="00:17:15.220" style="s2">one of my teachers put it as a journey</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.189" end="00:17:17.790" style="s2">of progressive approximation using a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.220" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">kind of mathematical metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.790" end="00:17:26.350" style="s2">anyhow having perhaps found some</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">guidelines of a pathway out of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.350" end="00:17:35.290" style="s2">stage the fifth stage is convening wise</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.440" end="00:17:36.850" style="s2">action and here we group of people</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.290" end="00:17:37.870" style="s2">together in some way I have to bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.850" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.870" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">transformational change and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:51.250" style="s2">required wisdom and balance and so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">the use of some form of indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.250" end="00:18:00.430" style="s2">wisdom circle is very helpful here that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:03.820" style="s2">one of my colleagues has translated into</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.430" end="00:18:06.550" style="s2">a form that will sit more comfortably in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.820" end="00:18:10.570" style="s2">our culture but the essence of it is if</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.550" end="00:18:13.360" style="s2">we&#39;re not a as a group to share a</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.570" end="00:18:16.890" style="s2">consciousness of looking from multiple</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.360" end="00:18:20.770" style="s2">perspectives simultaneously and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.890" end="00:18:28.360" style="s2">meditating on that and arriving at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.770" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">decision the decision is four then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.360" end="00:18:33.100" style="s2">have to do something because doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:36.970" style="s2">nothing is a decision as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.100" end="00:18:40.059" style="s2">probably ill-informed but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.970" end="00:18:44.110" style="s2">hand it&#39;s got a half life it&#39;s only you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.059" end="00:18:47.800" style="s2">know until you situations evolve the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.110" end="00:18:50.500" style="s2">next cycle of learning and decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.800" end="00:18:54.550" style="s2">making now having said those five things</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.500" end="00:18:57.670" style="s2">of course is seven because the first one</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:19:00.700" style="s2">is about taking the necessary synergy so</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.670" end="00:19:02.679" style="s2">it brings in the idea of synergy which i</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.700" end="00:19:07.030" style="s2">think is a bigger idea than systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.679" end="00:19:11.350" style="s2">thinking but includes it and and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.030" end="00:19:15.300" style="s2">final session is more only so will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.350" end="00:19:18.460" style="s2">about facilitating how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.300" end="00:19:21.820" style="s2">particularly link these three circles</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.460" end="00:19:24.850" style="s2">together now all that&#39;s online in each</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.820" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">session is two hours so the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.850" end="00:19:30.370" style="s2">been exercising is how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.610" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">kind of to use a metaphor a homeopathy</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.370" end="00:19:35.800" style="s2">of our methods now we&#39;re a diluted very</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:40.660" style="s2">small dose of something will actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.800" end="00:19:43.780" style="s2">have the requisite effect it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.660" end="00:19:46.420" style="s2">more potent level than the usual webinar</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.780" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">ish talking you know like this on on a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.420" end="00:19:51.380" style="s2">web</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:53.120" style="s2">and so we have so evidence that we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.380" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">get a little bit better than that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.120" end="00:19:58.760" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna carry on that route and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:00.680" style="s2">hope that that&#39;s great I never I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.760" end="00:20:02.870" style="s2">never described it that briefly before I</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.680" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">hope it&#39;s not too unintelligible no I</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.870" end="00:20:07.430" style="s2">thought it was really useful and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:09.680" style="s2">I&#39;ll share the link to the course</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.430" end="00:20:11.420" style="s2">description along with this so people</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.680" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">can kind of listen to you while they</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.420" end="00:20:18.740" style="s2">look at the the website the the the one</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:21.380" style="s2">question - both seven two hour sessions</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.740" end="00:20:24.830" style="s2">what kind of format did do you envision</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.380" end="00:20:29.450" style="s2">for them roughly well I&#39;m trying to mix</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.830" end="00:20:32.450" style="s2">a number of ingredients because I&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.450" end="00:20:35.750" style="s2">learned that we go nuts after even an</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.450" end="00:20:40.610" style="s2">hour of zooming unless it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.750" end="00:20:42.650" style="s2">intense reason being together and so two</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.610" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">hours is actually quite a long attention</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.650" end="00:20:50.330" style="s2">stretch but if this was a face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">workshop we clearly have as well as some</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:58.780" style="s2">talking we&#39;d have some discussion we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:21:05.180" style="s2">have some exercises we&#39;d have some</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.780" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">reflective feedback and so on so the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.180" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">format will be flexible but basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:17.150" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an introduction of the key</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:19.490" style="s2">notion of the method and since this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.150" end="00:21:23.150" style="s2">visual facilitation approach there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.490" end="00:21:26.860" style="s2">big emphasis on diagrams but how to use</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.150" end="00:21:31.000" style="s2">diagrams facilitative ly rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.860" end="00:21:34.040" style="s2">analytically and conceptually they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.000" end="00:21:38.450" style="s2">everyone has to bring a project or more</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.040" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">than one project to the course that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.450" end="00:21:43.430" style="s2">are us to work on as their laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:46.100" style="s2">for applying the methods to to see what</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.430" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">they get hmm and they&#39;ll be feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.100" end="00:21:53.620" style="s2">that and I&#39;ll be more in a coaching role</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.200" end="00:21:57.170" style="s2">to say well stuck on that Brian little</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.620" end="00:22:02.150" style="s2">interesting your observation of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.170" end="00:22:05.660" style="s2">of getting this book here is just what</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.150" end="00:22:07.640" style="s2">you know Charlie and Mary need in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.660" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">group who said they got stuck you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.640" end="00:22:14.060" style="s2">you can so that there&#39;s a kind of begin</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:16.100" style="s2">to be immutable and then there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.060" end="00:22:19.700" style="s2">little bit about you know where is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.100" end="00:22:24.020" style="s2">being used use cases to give people</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.700" end="00:22:26.540" style="s2">confidence that it can be done there may</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.020" end="00:22:29.210" style="s2">be people in the group of tried some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.540" end="00:22:33.410" style="s2">this and can also share their experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.210" end="00:22:35.690" style="s2">and then there&#39;ll be some quick guidance</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.410" end="00:22:38.660" style="s2">into the resource library so the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.690" end="00:22:41.810" style="s2">for any approach realized they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.660" end="00:22:46.490" style="s2">toolkit and her tool bag on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.810" end="00:22:51.550" style="s2">web and um and hopefully even enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.490" end="00:22:56.330" style="s2">time for some open Q&amp;A and reflection</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.550" end="00:22:59.810" style="s2">just to share you know being together as</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">a learning circle I&#39;m really excited</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.810" end="00:23:03.550" style="s2">that finally I mean this has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">cooking for a long time in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.550" end="00:23:08.780" style="s2">conversations when was the meeting that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.230" end="00:23:12.980" style="s2">we had where Robert Fripp was then</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.780" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">Alfonso month we read IFF meeting where</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.980" end="00:23:17.960" style="s2">we know it&#39;s about right twenty Twenty</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:20.270" style="s2">twenty sixteen nothing yeah and that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.960" end="00:23:24.290" style="s2">really early trying to state so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.270" end="00:23:26.330" style="s2">exactly what four years ago yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.290" end="00:23:29.560" style="s2">I I thought well this is something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.330" end="00:23:29.560" style="s2">going to do in the next six months</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.560" end="00:23:39.980" style="s2">what I find really exciting is they did</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:43.310" style="s2">the synergy of an earlier version of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.980" end="00:23:46.040" style="s2">five five core components conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.310" end="00:23:50.720" style="s2">we had sometime last September and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.040" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">reason element of somebody from a UK</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.720" end="00:23:56.660" style="s2">Council saying I would like to go on</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">this this journey with my consulate and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.660" end="00:24:03.070" style="s2">explore it is just a wonderful example</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:06.410" style="s2">of how this transformational journey</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.070" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">could also be offered more enhanced this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.410" end="00:24:12.169" style="s2">vision of h3 uni inside where</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:13.789" style="s2">a group of people in a in a public</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.169" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">authority or an organization come</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.789" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">together and say we could learn all</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:20.809" style="s2">these methodologies as we go on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:22.460" style="s2">journey with this course together and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.809" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">then rather than each one bringing their</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.460" end="00:24:29.240" style="s2">own projects the the whole cohort can</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:30.620" style="s2">actually between the session and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.240" end="00:24:32.179" style="s2">get the feedback I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.620" end="00:24:33.799" style="s2">powerful format not just as an</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.179" end="00:24:35.539" style="s2">educational program but actually as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.799" end="00:24:38.570" style="s2">capacity building program within</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.539" end="00:24:41.720" style="s2">organizations well as you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.570" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">previous stage in my life I worked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.720" end="00:24:49.789" style="s2">on the idea of learning organizations</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:52.130" style="s2">and worked with people I carried a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.789" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">hearse and you know the work Peter sang</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.130" end="00:24:59.900" style="s2">he was doing and it was very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:01.669" style="s2">to get a learning organization and just</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.900" end="00:25:06.409" style="s2">listening to you now it struck me oh</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.740" end="00:26:09.289" style="s2">hoc groups of people have to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.289" end="00:26:12.289" style="s2">together and I think that with these</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.289" end="00:26:14.409" style="s2">kinds of tools and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.289" end="00:26:17.330" style="s2">confidence of making the journey</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.380" end="00:26:25.050" style="s2">situation well who knows we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.200" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">I might be working on an opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:31.260" style="s2">some people in Portugal as well well I</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.260" end="00:26:38.490" style="s2">no I hope I hope that I hope that we may</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.910" end="00:26:42.170" style="s2">have reached a point with this work that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.490" end="00:26:45.330" style="s2">is it&#39;s got sufficient sort of self</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.170" end="00:26:48.270" style="s2">generating integrity that we can truly</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.330" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">share it and share it in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.270" end="00:26:57.380" style="s2">whoever sort of partners into it is also</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:27:00.230" style="s2">bringing their own learning their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.380" end="00:27:04.470" style="s2">contribution and the whole thing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.230" end="00:27:07.110" style="s2">begins to spread let&#39;s call it the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.470" end="00:27:12.900" style="s2">regenerative effect shall we Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.110" end="00:27:16.410" style="s2">yogurt culture exactly just supposing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.900" end="00:27:18.090" style="s2">takes exactly wonderful and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.410" end="00:27:19.710" style="s2">should keep this recording relatively</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.090" end="00:27:22.620" style="s2">short the Suites of Europe but yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.710" end="00:27:24.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a I&#39;ll stop now but thanks so</p>

<p begin="00:27:31.770" end="00:27:36.210" style="s2">they can see the seven steps and tap</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.260" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">into some more you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.210" end="00:27:40.710" style="s2">background that I&#39;m being laying out</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:42.630" style="s2">there anyhow thank you Dan Li I feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.710" end="00:27:45.540" style="s2">much clearer about my own course now</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.630" end="00:27:47.670" style="s2">it&#39;s very good exercise to also it on</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.540" end="00:27:50.460" style="s2">the spot one thing that that should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.670" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">highlighted is that because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.460" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">is of course as you started off with</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">that is taking you through a set of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:59.730" style="s2">tools that is that are already freely</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:02.250" style="s2">shared on the h3 on the resource library</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:04.350" style="s2">it actually is a blended learning course</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.250" end="00:28:07.560" style="s2">in the sense it&#39;s you you don&#39;t only get</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.350" end="00:28:09.900" style="s2">the seven sessions you also get a huge</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.560" end="00:28:12.150" style="s2">amount of rich material that will make a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.900" end="00:28:14.970" style="s2">lot more sense to you with the seven</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.150" end="00:28:18.410" style="s2">sessions so um yeah I&#39;m looking forward</p>
