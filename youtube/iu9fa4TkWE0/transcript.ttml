<p begin="00:00:14.389" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">welcome back to awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:24.509" style="s2">meeting crisis so last time we looked in</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:28.259" style="s2">depth at Corbin and Yonge and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.509" end="00:00:31.340" style="s2">draw very deeply the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.259" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">relationship to the sacred second self I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.340" end="00:00:36.420" style="s2">launched into sort of a critical sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.739" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">mutual criticism between Corbin and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">Yonge and brought in some Buber along</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:43.430" style="s2">the way and then I pointed to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">whose work also deriving from Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.430" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">integrates aspects of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">together and kind of a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:51.540" style="s2">Tillich is deeply influenced and aware</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">of what he calls depth psychology the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.540" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">kind of psychology and Jung of course is</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:59.880" style="s2">deeply aware of Heidegger I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:03.059" style="s2">don&#39;t think that Tillich was aware of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.880" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">Corbin but he is deeply aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.059" end="00:01:09.320" style="s2">symbol of the symbol in an imaginal Wow</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">there than in a merely imaginary way</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.320" end="00:01:14.340" style="s2">Tillich takes the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">seriously he writes perhaps his most</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">well known and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">masterpiece book the courage to be as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">response to the meaning crisis like Jung</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">and Corbin and for very related reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">he&#39;s deeply critical of literalism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:32.219" style="s2">fundamentalism throughout but he takes</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">it deeper as I mentioned he really</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.219" end="00:01:36.899" style="s2">deepens it in terms of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:39.569" style="s2">critique of Anto theology and he becomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.899" end="00:01:42.149" style="s2">critical of live literalism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.569" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">fundamentalisms as forms of idolatry in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.149" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">which we are attempting to have right</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.409" end="00:01:53.819" style="s2">rather than become so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.969" style="s2">excellent books on the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.819" end="00:02:00.209" style="s2">between Jung and Tillich this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.969" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">series of ongoing work by John doar Lee</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.209" end="00:02:05.459" style="s2">I recommend two books to you the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">is sacrament which I tweeted about in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.459" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">book recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">I was also represent his later book Paul</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:16.920" style="s2">Tillich Carl Jung and the recovery of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.410" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">religion but make no mistake Dooley is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.920" end="00:02:22.320" style="s2">not talking about a recovery in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:24.270" style="s2">nostalgic sense he writes another book</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.320" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">called strategy for a loss of faith</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.270" end="00:02:30.840" style="s2">where he is trying to get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:34.320" style="s2">classical theism and so I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.840" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">Early&#39;s work as a comprehensive way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:38.960" style="s2">bringing about a deep dialog and a kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">of integration between Jung and Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.960" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">okay so Tillich say is the main response</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:47.240" style="s2">to the meeting crisis and here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">Tillich is not just theorizing he is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.240" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">trying to give us guidance on how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">live and let&#39;s remember that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">written really matters because of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">know the way Tillich resisted the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:06.630" style="s2">because what Tillich talks about in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">courage to be is courage now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.630" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">careful to note that this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:12.950" style="s2">existential courage that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">allows us to confront and overcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:17.870" style="s2">meaninglessness in its depth but also of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:22.740" style="s2">course to more practically responds</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.870" end="00:03:25.740" style="s2">respond to you know perverted responses</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.740" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">to the meaning crisis itself like Nazism</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.740" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s Gnostic nightmare this process</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:35.130" style="s2">of encouragement now he is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">Aristotle he&#39;s talking about he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.130" end="00:03:41.220" style="s2">talking about something as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">just bravery facing danger or fortitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:46.170" style="s2">the ability to endure no for Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:49.350" style="s2">courage is a virtue there&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.170" end="00:03:52.770" style="s2">wisdom in Courage Courage&#39;s involves</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.350" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">with it within it what that central</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.770" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">feature of wisdom which is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.500" style="s2">through allusion into reality the brave</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">person faces danger but that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.500" end="00:04:02.040" style="s2">can say about them the person with</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">fortitude endures difficulty but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.040" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">all we can say of them the courageous</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:11.190" style="s2">person sees through the illusion and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:17.150" style="s2">distortion of fear or distress to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.190" end="00:04:17.150" style="s2">is truly good and acts accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:24.710" style="s2">so that what is this seeing through and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.419" end="00:04:26.569" style="s2">how does it help us confront the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.710" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">crisis so this notion of seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.569" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">seeing to the depths as telic often says</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:39.379" style="s2">right his Tillich&#39;s is related to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:41.389" style="s2">Tillich&#39;s notion of faith and he notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.379" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">how we&#39;re circling back around and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.389" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t really a circle because Tillich&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">notion of faith is not the assertion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">propositions to believe believed he is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:57.289" style="s2">circling back right to the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">Israelite Hebrew notion of the auth and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.289" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">now we can add that that participatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">knowing in a course of being is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">aspirational process Tillich understands</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:16.039" style="s2">faith as ultimate concern that which</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:19.430" style="s2">concerns us ultimately his notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.039" end="00:05:22.789" style="s2">idolatry is to treat something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.430" end="00:05:26.900" style="s2">could be a symbolic icon through which</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.789" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">you expect you articulate and develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.900" end="00:05:32.599" style="s2">your ultimate concern you transform that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:35.620" style="s2">into a Idol an object to have and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.599" end="00:05:40.460" style="s2">possess to control and manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.620" end="00:05:42.020" style="s2">you thereby are using the machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.460" end="00:05:45.580" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate for ultimate concern</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.020" end="00:05:48.199" style="s2">for something that it is not ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.580" end="00:05:49.340" style="s2">what is ultimate concern what is concern</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.199" end="00:05:51.139" style="s2">well when you&#39;re concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.340" end="00:05:53.900" style="s2">something you care about it but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.139" end="00:05:56.360" style="s2">also coping with it you&#39;re committed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.900" end="00:05:59.029" style="s2">it you&#39;re involved in it it encompasses</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:06:01.969" style="s2">you even though you are being in right</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.029" end="00:06:04.340" style="s2">being involved in and through it it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.969" end="00:06:07.159" style="s2">deeply perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.340" end="00:06:10.909" style="s2">that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to get at and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.159" end="00:06:16.389" style="s2">is aspirational and it is open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.909" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">it points towards the inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.389" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">nassif being</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:28.060" style="s2">so of course this Tillich&#39;s notion is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.860" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">directed at hydrators notion of design</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.060" end="00:06:32.780" style="s2">right this concern this right that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:37.210" style="s2">design is the being whose being is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.780" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">question and therefore right by a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.210" end="00:06:41.030" style="s2">participatory our perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.169" end="00:06:43.130" style="s2">participatory knowing of our being we</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.030" end="00:06:44.449" style="s2">come into deeper contact but remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.130" end="00:06:46.850" style="s2">for Heidegger that requires a deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:49.100" style="s2">remembering an overcoming of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.850" end="00:06:51.650" style="s2">forgetfulness and Alafaya we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.100" end="00:06:56.289" style="s2">have the ontological wonder towards the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.650" end="00:06:56.289" style="s2">ground of meaning the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:04.699" style="s2">this leads right into Tillich&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.410" end="00:07:10.010" style="s2">of God which right I&#39;m going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.699" end="00:07:12.740" style="s2">propose to you is transgressive of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.010" end="00:07:15.830" style="s2">classical theism in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.740" end="00:07:19.780" style="s2">without it being identifiable with</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.830" end="00:07:19.780" style="s2">atheism in important ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:34.250" style="s2">so Tillich understands God as an icon as</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.450" end="00:07:39.530" style="s2">opposed to an idol as an imaginal symbol</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.250" end="00:07:41.300" style="s2">for the ground of being God symbolizes</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.530" end="00:07:45.710" style="s2">the ground of being and therefore God is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.300" end="00:07:52.039" style="s2">no kind of being there is a no thingness</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:55.370" style="s2">to God God is no kind of thing in any</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.039" end="00:08:02.530" style="s2">attempt to reify to think of God as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.370" end="00:08:05.539" style="s2">thing is for Tillich a form of idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.530" end="00:08:06.830" style="s2">so here&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get you to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.539" end="00:08:13.849" style="s2">see what Tillich means</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.830" end="00:08:16.599" style="s2">here&#39;s meaning right and here&#39;s reality</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.599" end="00:08:24.020" style="s2">God is the simultaneous grounding of all</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.340" end="00:08:25.699" style="s2">of these you can see the influence of</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.310" end="00:39:16.870" style="s2">so a couple of things Barfield is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.770" end="00:39:19.810" style="s2">definitely influenced by Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.870" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">narcissus and he&#39;s influenced by Rudolf</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.810" end="00:39:24.490" style="s2">Steiner and I won&#39;t go into it you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:30.730" style="s2">read the book in depth Steiner has like</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.490" end="00:39:34.780" style="s2">I either say too little or too much</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.730" end="00:39:36.760" style="s2">about Steiner it&#39;s it&#39;s a mystery to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.780" end="00:39:38.440" style="s2">many people myself included why Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.760" end="00:39:40.810" style="s2">was so taken with Steiner and saw</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.440" end="00:39:42.820" style="s2">thought so highly of him but if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.810" end="00:39:45.340" style="s2">reinterpret Steiner as basically a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.820" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">modern Gnostic who&#39;s generating a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.340" end="00:39:50.110" style="s2">gnostic mythology the two worlds and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:54.070" style="s2">divine spark and all this kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.110" end="00:39:56.200" style="s2">then you understand perhaps why Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.070" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">was so enamored with Steiner I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.200" end="00:40:00.540" style="s2">Steiner was the vehicle whereby</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:05.710" style="s2">Gnosticism comes into Barr fields</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.540" end="00:40:07.590" style="s2">thinking so Barfield is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.710" end="00:40:10.150" style="s2">influenced by gnosis he&#39;s influenced by</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.290" end="00:46:16.839" style="s2">write it right so for the Greeks or for</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.839" end="00:46:23.050" style="s2">can mean both wind or what we now think</p>

<p begin="00:46:39.630" end="00:46:43.770" style="s2">we really don&#39;t can&#39;t see it that way</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.770" end="00:46:48.810" style="s2">Barfield this division replicates the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.770" end="00:46:51.300" style="s2">sort of cartesian division between the</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.190" end="00:47:04.770" style="s2">when you go back there isn&#39;t this right</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.430" end="00:47:08.100" style="s2">these terms are used and they&#39;re treated</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.770" end="00:47:10.590" style="s2">as if they have a kind of identity what</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.100" end="00:47:15.770" style="s2">I would argue is a non logical identity</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.620" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">about it&#39;s about attentional scaling</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.470" end="00:59:15.400" style="s2">breaking the inappropriate frame moving</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:17.770" style="s2">through and making the new frame dirt</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.400" end="00:59:20.650" style="s2">Brooke is just as important as glaze in</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.770" end="00:59:24.600" style="s2">height and this is something Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.650" end="00:59:27.350" style="s2">picks up on that right the his notion of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.600" end="00:59:32.710" style="s2">creativity as participatory</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.350" end="00:59:34.970" style="s2">is not to be just passively receptive oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.710" end="00:59:37.100" style="s2">of course it&#39;s not what Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.970" end="00:59:39.470" style="s2">criticizes either the Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.100" end="00:59:42.590" style="s2">technological imposition of our will on</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.470" end="00:59:48.940" style="s2">the world that&#39;s not what&#39;s meant by</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.590" end="00:59:52.310" style="s2">poesis are either poesis is synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.940" end="00:59:54.290" style="s2">God because I think Barfield is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.310" end="00:59:57.290" style="s2">ultimately non-theistic and in some very</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.290" end="01:00:03.260" style="s2">important ways God plays the leading</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.290" end="01:00:06.140" style="s2">role but we contribute and this was the</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.260" end="01:00:08.180" style="s2">original Hebrew insight of the off we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.140" end="01:00:10.850" style="s2">not just passive recipients of history</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.180" end="01:00:13.370" style="s2">nor are we it&#39;s complete authors we</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.850" end="01:00:15.530" style="s2">participate history we participate in</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.370" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">history and we are synergistically</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.530" end="01:00:24.140" style="s2">working with God in its making is</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:26.570" style="s2">Barfield a non-theist I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.140" end="01:00:30.080" style="s2">can&#39;t make that argument as clearly as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.570" end="01:00:34.840" style="s2">can make it for Heidegger for Jung for</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.080" end="01:00:37.250" style="s2">Corbin for Tillich I suspect though if</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.840" end="01:00:40.790" style="s2">Barfield were to talk to these other</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.250" end="01:00:43.400" style="s2">prophets of the meaning crisis he would</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.790" end="01:00:46.450" style="s2">also be led into a kind of non theism</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.400" end="01:00:50.480" style="s2">that is clearly the case for people like</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.450" end="01:00:52.790" style="s2">Slagel who so deeply influenced him what</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:56.870" style="s2">have I tried to show you I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.790" end="01:00:58.730" style="s2">show you that the language the right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.870" end="01:01:00.410" style="s2">not the language that the greater the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.730" end="01:01:02.330" style="s2">the vocabulary the grammar of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.410" end="01:01:03.800" style="s2">framework of relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.330" end="01:01:07.130" style="s2">how it can be developed to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.800" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">spirituality and sacredness can be put</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.130" end="01:01:13.670" style="s2">into deep dialogue with Heidegger deep</p>
