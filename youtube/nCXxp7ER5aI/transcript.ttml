<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">him the spirit out of which all that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:45.240" style="s2">arises from right I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:47.849" style="s2">usually when I at least for me when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.240" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">think of theology or theologians I get</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.849" end="00:05:52.319" style="s2">this kind of picture of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:55.949" style="s2">old dudes you know in libraries or</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.319" end="00:05:58.949" style="s2">something you know were you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.949" end="00:06:03.180" style="s2">talk much and I don&#39;t know this is some</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.949" end="00:06:07.139" style="s2">kind of stodgy heavy you know medieval</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.180" end="00:06:09.330" style="s2">pictures come into my mind here though</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.139" end="00:06:11.969" style="s2">is like he&#39;s he&#39;s got a spark an</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.330" end="00:06:15.529" style="s2">aliveness to him and a curiosity and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.969" end="00:06:18.389" style="s2">playfulness that really I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.529" end="00:06:22.650" style="s2">speaks to what he refers to himself is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.389" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">primarily um a an artist</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.650" end="00:06:26.759" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:29.009" style="s2">in fact he characterizes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.759" end="00:06:32.370" style="s2">people that he studies as artists and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.009" end="00:06:34.169" style="s2">and a big part is is what will reveal</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:35.819" style="s2">especially in this first half of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.169" end="00:06:39.479" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m breaking you up in two</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.819" end="00:06:42.569" style="s2">parts the first half is is mostly about</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.479" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">him and where he&#39;s coming from and his</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.569" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">writing and who he&#39;s interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:50.939" style="s2">why and so he sees himself it and kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:55.560" style="s2">of found himself just following his</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.939" end="00:06:57.780" style="s2">interest having carving out a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.560" end="00:07:01.949" style="s2">unique perspective on Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.780" end="00:07:05.819" style="s2">theology I would say that he you could</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.949" end="00:07:08.370" style="s2">say he writes he&#39;s written in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.819" end="00:07:11.490" style="s2">is kind of like you could say from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.370" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">theological theologians perspective what</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.490" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">can they get out of Heidegger and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:19.919" style="s2">would say also that you know implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:23.250" style="s2">and probably explicitly what what if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.919" end="00:07:27.479" style="s2">look at theology from a Haida garyun</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.250" end="00:07:28.620" style="s2">perspective how do those two things when</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.479" end="00:07:32.849" style="s2">they talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.620" end="00:07:37.219" style="s2">what what&#39;s possible and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.849" end="00:07:40.319" style="s2">you could imagine how that would that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.219" end="00:07:43.830" style="s2">possibility those two things talking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.319" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">each other deeply reveal and shed light</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.830" end="00:07:52.440" style="s2">on our current time so my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">is that on one level you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.440" end="00:08:00.539" style="s2">talking about philosophy and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:08:06.900" style="s2">talking about theology yet what those</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.539" end="00:08:10.789" style="s2">categories articulate is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.900" end="00:08:13.729" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not abstract but</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.789" end="00:08:19.349" style="s2">fundamental in our concrete experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.729" end="00:08:24.539" style="s2">in other words how is it that everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.349" end="00:08:27.270" style="s2">on every level in our concrete life by</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.539" end="00:08:32.310" style="s2">virtue of what does it show presents</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.270" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">itself as intelligible at all right when</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.310" end="00:08:35.110" style="s2">you start to ask that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:40.660" style="s2">question then you start to get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.110" end="00:08:45.430" style="s2">fundamental understandings of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.660" end="00:08:48.410" style="s2">innermost sense of something and the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.430" end="00:08:50.960" style="s2">uppermost sense of something the Theo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.410" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">the gods I view the on toast the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.960" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">innermost if you bring those two things</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:09:03.460" style="s2">together those intimately sit under and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:06.710" style="s2">above as horizons of what makes anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.460" end="00:09:09.290" style="s2">intelligible as it is at all right how</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.710" end="00:09:11.930" style="s2">we can even perceive the difference</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.290" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">between where a town ends and a force</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.930" end="00:09:19.160" style="s2">begins that that it just closes itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:22.220" style="s2">as in that way at all that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.160" end="00:09:24.680" style="s2">discern those things right and build</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.220" end="00:09:27.650" style="s2">towns based on that discernment is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.680" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">movement of intelligibility which are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.650" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">given by these deep deep pre thematic</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.840" end="00:09:41.420" style="s2">understanding of being so as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.560" end="00:09:43.070" style="s2">listening as you&#39;re listening to this I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.420" end="00:09:46.790" style="s2">what I want to encourage you to do is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.070" end="00:09:48.140" style="s2">is is to tune into that that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.790" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">authors and the people that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.140" end="00:09:53.870" style="s2">talking about in Heidegger are really</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:57.160" style="s2">addressing that level of things not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.870" end="00:10:00.740" style="s2">abstract ideas right but that which</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.160" end="00:10:05.780" style="s2">animates our perceptions our pre</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.740" end="00:10:11.260" style="s2">cognitions right as for Miki would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.780" end="00:10:18.650" style="s2">our relevance realization alright enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.260" end="00:10:22.460" style="s2">this first half is mostly us getting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.650" end="00:10:26.050" style="s2">know him and what he&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.460" end="00:10:28.610" style="s2">and and what it&#39;s like being him and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.050" end="00:10:31.430" style="s2">then unfortunately he had some technical</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.610" end="00:10:33.290" style="s2">difficulties so it cuts off and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:36.020" style="s2">where I cut off that&#39;s where I end this</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.290" end="00:10:40.760" style="s2">the first section and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.020" end="00:10:42.200" style="s2">part will be in in video in this next</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.790" end="00:10:53.630" style="s2">when he came back on I forgot to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.810" end="00:10:55.880" style="s2">record button for like 10 minutes so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.630" end="00:10:58.460" style="s2">will I will fill I&#39;ll try to backtrack</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.290" end="00:11:14.840" style="s2">going in dialectics and understanding in</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.960" end="00:11:16.700" style="s2">orienting but we&#39;re actually the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.840" end="00:11:21.230" style="s2">conversation becomes almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.700" end="00:11:27.950" style="s2">entity in itself and me we begin to be</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.820" end="00:12:16.040" style="s2">the one I&#39;m reading currently I read the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.190" end="00:12:21.860" style="s2">first one okay that was hot</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.860" end="00:12:27.470" style="s2">a bunch of different levels like one is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.410" end="00:12:30.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that I personally and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.470" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">scoured everything on Heidegger&#39;s as far</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.380" end="00:12:37.010" style="s2">as I can tell and I&#39;ve never seen</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:41.330" style="s2">somebody really zero in on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.010" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">perspective of theology and Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.330" end="00:12:46.250" style="s2">like the like though there was one book</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:49.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like well what as a theology if I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.250" end="00:12:53.240" style="s2">read Heidegger like I&#39;m like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.130" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">very different way of looking and in it</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.240" end="00:12:57.560" style="s2">how it speaks to me and how it links to</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:12:59.240" style="s2">kind of like what I&#39;m doing and like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.560" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">lot of the conversations and dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.240" end="00:13:02.769" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:05.529" style="s2">having as it seems to be what&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.769" end="00:13:08.259" style="s2">is really dealing with I think what</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.529" end="00:13:10.360" style="s2">Heidegger called nihilism all of its</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.259" end="00:13:13.300" style="s2">forms in all of its nothingness and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.360" end="00:13:18.059" style="s2">of its concealment right and I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.300" end="00:13:21.699" style="s2">in I live in the Bay Area which is where</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.059" end="00:13:24.009" style="s2">tech like technology I I&#39;m I&#39;m right at</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.699" end="00:13:27.339" style="s2">the point where I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.009" end="00:13:30.040" style="s2">future for the whole world happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.339" end="00:13:31.809" style="s2">quicker and quicker and quicker and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.040" end="00:13:33.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.809" end="00:13:35.980" style="s2">talking to you that are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.430" end="00:13:39.129" style="s2">sense of this right feel a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.980" end="00:13:42.069" style="s2">urgency about it but it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.129" end="00:13:45.879" style="s2">how to respond and in a big conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.069" end="00:13:49.329" style="s2">in that has been well what is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.879" end="00:13:52.449" style="s2">possible for people to find meaning mmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.329" end="00:13:54.189" style="s2">through Christianity right then one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.449" end="00:13:57.759" style="s2">the conversations and it&#39;s been a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.189" end="00:13:59.379" style="s2">productive dialogue oh I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.759" end="00:14:02.199" style="s2">conversation that we had hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.379" end="00:14:04.269" style="s2">about like it&#39;s it&#39;s not been about</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.199" end="00:14:06.699" style="s2">gotten bogged down into the like is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.269" end="00:14:09.370" style="s2">there a god and I do you believe in God</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.699" end="00:14:13.660" style="s2">and in any of those kind of new feet</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.370" end="00:14:16.689" style="s2">like atheist debates it&#39;s more like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.660" end="00:14:20.980" style="s2">a pop is it even it is it even possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.689" end="00:14:23.290" style="s2">to have a religion in that sense right</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.980" end="00:14:27.370" style="s2">if you are religious and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.290" end="00:14:29.529" style="s2">church is does that actually is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.370" end="00:14:33.759" style="s2">possible to not be in the age of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.529" end="00:14:36.550" style="s2">nihilism and so even if you do that all</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.759" end="00:14:38.230" style="s2">the time like you know I think you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.550" end="00:14:40.059" style="s2">all you can still say it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.230" end="00:14:44.769" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on that our time</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.059" end="00:14:46.809" style="s2">seems to be um this kind of loss of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.769" end="00:14:49.990" style="s2">being as hider who would talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.809" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">so a lot of conversations have been been</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.990" end="00:14:55.449" style="s2">circling around that so when I I read</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:58.199" style="s2">your your your books I&#39;m like would this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.449" end="00:15:00.730" style="s2">is this is you have a perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.199" end="00:15:05.019" style="s2">this and an angle in a place that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.730" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">looking from that has me wonder what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.019" end="00:15:11.139" style="s2">it that&#39;s caught what&#39;s what&#39;s speaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:12.430" style="s2">to you such that then you&#39;re drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.139" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">write about</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.430" end="00:15:16.540" style="s2">like are you I have all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:20.230" style="s2">curiosities is like are you hello Jen</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.230" end="00:15:28.649" style="s2">Christian are you like how did woody but</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.790" end="00:15:31.779" style="s2">what are you listening to says have you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.649" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">feel of attackers right so we can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.779" end="00:15:46.149" style="s2">can&#39;t let that one slide like being kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:51.520" style="s2">of uniquely kind of calibrated in those</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.149" end="00:15:54.790" style="s2">lives so so uniquely calibrated in those</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.520" end="00:15:58.060" style="s2">lines because I think um I mean I study</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.790" end="00:16:00.250" style="s2">theology so I went to seminary still</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.060" end="00:16:02.170" style="s2">have two degrees in theology and then i</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.250" end="00:16:07.149" style="s2">studied english and literature</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.170" end="00:16:08.740" style="s2">shakespeare a UNT and then i was a high</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.149" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">school teacher for some time for i</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.740" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">became a professor at TCC Tarrant County</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:19.029" style="s2">College Fort Worth so a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">mentors I had initially when I studied</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.029" end="00:16:24.839" style="s2">theology were church historian that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:27.400" style="s2">one of my mentors right his talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.839" end="00:16:29.020" style="s2">and the other one was a person who</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.400" end="00:16:31.630" style="s2">specialized in crippled guard but that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.020" end="00:16:32.740" style="s2">one seems made bigger and so both of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.630" end="00:16:36.730" style="s2">them knew how to go really well</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.740" end="00:16:39.610" style="s2">typically and so I came to Heidegger by</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.730" end="00:16:42.910" style="s2">way of Sartre learning um who&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.610" end="00:16:45.580" style="s2">Archer person who is he doing right oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.910" end="00:16:48.370" style="s2">but I&#39;ve always kind of kept myself kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.580" end="00:16:51.430" style="s2">of between these two roads Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.370" end="00:16:54.550" style="s2">philosophy and then what for their role</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.430" end="00:16:56.680" style="s2">goes but also hydras contributions to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.550" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">theology and theologians in particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.680" end="00:17:02.860" style="s2">and how they take their road so I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:04.870" style="s2">kind of a philosopher theologian or</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.860" end="00:17:07.179" style="s2">theologian philosopher sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.870" end="00:17:11.020" style="s2">kind of bridging both of these roads the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.179" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">same time you currently you have you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.020" end="00:17:14.160" style="s2">married do you have kids</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.209" end="00:17:23.800" style="s2">okay yes they give me more time also</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.220" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">also just one of the things Isis what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.800" end="00:17:26.199" style="s2">actually clicked on your authored page</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:28.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.199" end="00:17:30.190" style="s2">look I wanted it I knew that you&#39;d you</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.919" end="00:18:20.289" style="s2">woods but I just got a break working and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.570" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">working then I put aside for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.289" end="00:18:31.570" style="s2">then I start writing again and I started</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">writing novels and writing poetry short</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.570" end="00:18:35.889" style="s2">stories all those things and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.169" style="s2">got me I&#39;m always I will always be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.889" end="00:18:41.350" style="s2">novelist it&#39;s now part of who I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.169" end="00:18:42.940" style="s2">created wise you know yeah I used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:45.130" style="s2">paint I was a painter at one point when</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.940" end="00:18:49.830" style="s2">I was younger younger younger person I</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.130" end="00:18:53.139" style="s2">used to study the grete sonic impression</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.830" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">so I have those artistic streak in me I</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.139" end="00:18:57.610" style="s2">think and I think that I&#39;m always kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:19:01.000" style="s2">of thought that that&#39;s probably how I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.610" end="00:19:02.529" style="s2">see Heidegger as a sort of an artist in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.000" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">a lot of ways I mean he&#39;s presenting</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.529" end="00:19:07.830" style="s2">things and artistic approach even this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:10.179" style="s2">idea of being is a very aesthetic so</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.830" end="00:19:13.149" style="s2">theologians typically are artists I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.179" end="00:19:16.840" style="s2">think as well yeah and they calibrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.149" end="00:19:19.860" style="s2">things in certain ways based on how they</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.840" end="00:19:22.899" style="s2">see the systematic theology working</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.860" end="00:19:24.399" style="s2">because because the first book are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.899" end="00:19:27.460" style="s2">four theologians that are influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.399" end="00:19:29.919" style="s2">a group particularly and each of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.460" end="00:19:32.830" style="s2">use Heidegger different ways and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2">take these four paths as times that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.830" end="00:19:36.669" style="s2">begin with Heidegger but then they</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.360" end="00:19:37.899" style="s2">become themselves what I call Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.669" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">in theology which of course is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.899" end="00:19:41.740" style="s2">blasphemous thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:43.150" style="s2">with that let&#39;s see what I will go with</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.740" end="00:19:43.660" style="s2">that that&#39;s what I feel you know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.150" end="00:19:48.340" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.660" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">yeah I thought that that became kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.340" end="00:19:53.860" style="s2">I think a good inroads to this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">conversation about what is higher degree</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.860" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">have to say to theology and what places</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:20:01.960" style="s2">how to grab which i think is are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:03.670" style="s2">kind of come to the fold one more now I</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.960" end="00:20:06.370" style="s2">think but as you mentioned I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.670" end="00:20:07.900" style="s2">there&#39;s not a whole lot know about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.370" end="00:20:11.620" style="s2">I mean I know there&#39;s Judith wolf who I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.900" end="00:20:13.890" style="s2">know is right and but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.620" end="00:20:17.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot the French the French</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.890" end="00:20:20.200" style="s2">theologians great now monologist but</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.320" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">they&#39;re they seem to be a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.200" end="00:20:27.490" style="s2">defining themselves and how they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:29.190" style="s2">yes there they are but they&#39;re pushing</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.490" end="00:20:33.430" style="s2">against Heidegger at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.190" end="00:20:35.650" style="s2">exactly saying exactly truly I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.430" end="00:20:38.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension there I think and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.650" end="00:20:39.970" style="s2">think a lot of it is I think a lot of us</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.260" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">like that ignorant or maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.970" end="00:20:44.680" style="s2">forgetfulness about what Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:48.490" style="s2">early career was like he was a previous</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.680" end="00:20:49.870" style="s2">study to be a a priest in school that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.490" end="00:20:52.210" style="s2">was kind of get it you know and then he</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.870" end="00:20:53.800" style="s2">moved away from that but yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.210" end="00:20:55.150" style="s2">processor roots are always there you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.800" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">know you do the wolf is talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.150" end="00:21:01.320" style="s2">you know cross roots are still there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:04.120" style="s2">his first his first teaching position</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.320" end="00:21:05.890" style="s2">was out of school he worked hand in hand</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.120" end="00:21:08.410" style="s2">with a lot of the allusions to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.890" end="00:21:10.120" style="s2">working with he worked with boatman</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.410" end="00:21:11.590" style="s2">boatman was gets their started he worked</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.120" end="00:21:14.560" style="s2">for Tillich when you&#39;re testing started</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.590" end="00:21:15.850" style="s2">so these shared ideas he and both my did</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.560" end="00:21:19.150" style="s2">a lot of work together you know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.850" end="00:21:20.470" style="s2">Mitch and seminars they would conduct</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.150" end="00:21:23.620" style="s2">together they were gonna write a book</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.470" end="00:21:25.620" style="s2">the other so they always are walking</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.620" end="00:21:29.080" style="s2">hand-in-hand I think they realize that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.620" end="00:21:32.350" style="s2">the ology of philosophy can inform each</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.080" end="00:21:34.510" style="s2">other about being in such just changed</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.350" end="00:21:36.190" style="s2">that&#39;s something there you go back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.510" end="00:21:39.430" style="s2">Aquinas or Agustin they they recognize</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.190" end="00:21:40.930" style="s2">that lastly you contributed to what</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.430" end="00:21:43.540" style="s2">we&#39;re doing I mean you&#39;re Plato&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.930" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">Dustin and yeah you know finest</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.540" end="00:21:49.210" style="s2">Aristotle and it&#39;s always there but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:51.040" style="s2">over time it&#39;s become kind of he because</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.210" end="00:21:53.770" style="s2">of his not because there&#39;s not see you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.040" end="00:21:56.410" style="s2">know that&#39;s the affiliation in the third</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.770" end="00:21:57.370" style="s2">it&#39;s become really tricky to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.410" end="00:22:02.110" style="s2">what can he say</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.370" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">so theology having been involved yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.110" end="00:22:06.370" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">you know not that the more I read about</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">that the more the sense that actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.820" end="00:22:18.700" style="s2">strange assay but I just get this sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:23.020" style="s2">it he was more irritated with with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.700" end="00:22:24.850" style="s2">Nazis because it was it wasn&#39;t the Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.020" end="00:22:29.170" style="s2">Party that he thought was gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.850" end="00:22:31.059" style="s2">right he was actually in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.170" end="00:22:35.170" style="s2">and actually we just read something</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.059" end="00:22:38.790" style="s2">about about that somebody who wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.170" end="00:22:42.309" style="s2">book about played Plato and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.790" end="00:22:43.480" style="s2">Heidegger and where he was weaving it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.309" end="00:22:47.130" style="s2">together he&#39;s like I think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.480" end="00:22:47.130" style="s2">Heidegger actually miss read Plato</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.530" end="00:22:55.330" style="s2">thank you Miss he&#39;s an artist yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.320" end="00:22:58.059" style="s2">not concerned with staying true to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.330" end="00:22:59.530" style="s2">Greek as he translated the Greek so he</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.059" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">plays with that a little bit I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.530" end="00:23:04.780" style="s2">can take me there are dogs of course you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:06.309" style="s2">know he&#39;s only that right we take like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.780" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">citizen and we say this sentence</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.309" end="00:23:14.860" style="s2">represents the whole the same thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">certain aspects of Plato certain aspects</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.860" end="00:23:22.330" style="s2">yeah its amici for sure advance his own</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:24.429" style="s2">philosophy right so so often what was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.330" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">been said a lot about he does with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.429" end="00:23:29.140" style="s2">of those speakers is that he what they</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">call Heidegger eyes as those thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.140" end="00:23:33.580" style="s2">which is the term that God may use he he</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:35.380" style="s2">uses them for his own purposes without</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.580" end="00:23:36.730" style="s2">really being true to what they&#39;re dogs</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.380" end="00:23:38.050" style="s2">you can easily look at his readings of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.730" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">Plato and say well there&#39;s good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.050" end="00:23:43.750" style="s2">there but also this translation of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:45.400" style="s2">Greek word is not actually there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.750" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">playful playful approach to what are you</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.400" end="00:23:53.050" style="s2">doing that and that and that playfulness</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:54.550" style="s2">and that that that link that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.050" end="00:23:57.070" style="s2">actually made yourself of like what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.550" end="00:23:59.140" style="s2">heard you say is like yeah these are the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.070" end="00:24:01.330" style="s2">past that I&#39;ve taken like the middle the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.140" end="00:24:04.419" style="s2">middle way between it like theology and</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.330" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">the philosophy then he said this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.419" end="00:24:12.200" style="s2">but really like I&#39;ll always be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll always and then there&#39;s a way where</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.200" end="00:24:17.720" style="s2">you you you kind of like you said that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:22.040" style="s2">about Heidegger and and other</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.720" end="00:24:23.750" style="s2">theologians so when you like I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.040" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">at all is kind of asking with the high</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.750" end="00:24:29.900" style="s2">daguerreian kind of question which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:32.390" style="s2">when you say artists now I&#39;m not asking</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.900" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">you necessarily what an artist is but</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.390" end="00:24:37.700" style="s2">what do you mean right when you say</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.690" end="00:26:12.920" style="s2">famous early works the spirit in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.520" end="00:26:15.260" style="s2">world which used Heidegger very</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.920" end="00:26:16.850" style="s2">explicitly as well as a another Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.260" end="00:26:20.630" style="s2">Baker that he&#39;s kind of leaving together</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.850" end="00:26:21.500" style="s2">but he he he would not have been what he</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.580" style="s2">and how he was involved in hashing out</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.540" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">these issues with the Pope during that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.580" end="00:26:39.230" style="s2">period in 60s and 70s he became probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:40.510" style="s2">is try to make that piston forest far as</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.230" end="00:26:45.170" style="s2">say I think probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.510" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">influential and most theological of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.170" end="00:26:49.040" style="s2">theologians not just Catholic but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:51.800" style="s2">would say in German his body of work is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.040" end="00:26:54.230" style="s2">master yes wrote all the time</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.800" end="00:26:57.230" style="s2">everything&#39;s huge he&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.230" end="00:26:58.670" style="s2">systematically but he&#39;s also influenced</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.230" end="00:27:02.060" style="s2">I think about phenomenology which I</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.670" end="00:27:06.260" style="s2">think it&#39;s party yeah the whole side of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.060" end="00:27:10.250" style="s2">it of the 30s now meet you the other was</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.260" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">like Chilean Tillich is a he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.250" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">falls a lab with an existential theology</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">which I which I&#39;ve written yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">concerned with being in a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.100" style="s2">specialized way how if you read any he</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:28.610" style="s2">released yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.100" end="00:27:30.380" style="s2">really yeah when I was in I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.610" end="00:27:33.250" style="s2">like right out of high school I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.380" end="00:27:33.250" style="s2">reading Tillich and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.400" end="00:27:40.460" style="s2">but the thing you know because because</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">John considers Killick one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.460" end="00:27:47.240" style="s2">prophets of the of the addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.100" end="00:27:49.700" style="s2">meaning crisis right and he in like he</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.240" end="00:27:51.290" style="s2">makes his distinction because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.700" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">things where John&#39;s kind of coming from</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.290" end="00:27:59.300" style="s2">me saying that you know I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:28:03.860" style="s2">it&#39;s actually possible right for for us</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.300" end="00:28:07.160" style="s2">to have for it to be viable today given</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.860" end="00:28:10.010" style="s2">the age that we&#39;re in and given like how</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.160" end="00:28:12.140" style="s2">deeply embedded in science in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.010" end="00:28:12.860" style="s2">fashioned us that we don&#39;t even have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.140" end="00:28:18.830" style="s2">know about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.860" end="00:28:20.810" style="s2">right can we can we can we have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.830" end="00:28:24.410" style="s2">religion that&#39;s theist</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.810" end="00:28:29.510" style="s2">mmm he&#39;s not saying like he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.410" end="00:28:33.200" style="s2">arguing whether or not we&#39;re it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.510" end="00:28:36.950" style="s2">like is it viable will it will it turn</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.200" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">in relief being in a cent in a sensible</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.950" end="00:28:43.460" style="s2">way and that&#39;s what a big question that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:46.520" style="s2">he has an in his work and he Tillich is</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.460" end="00:28:48.520" style="s2">is one of the few people that he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.520" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">that Tillich is actually not a theist</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.520" end="00:28:55.730" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a good critique it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:57.860" style="s2">a bit tricky because he is he is so</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.730" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">influenced by philosophy that he is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.860" end="00:29:06.530" style="s2">bit hesitant to think of God in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:08.180" style="s2">theistic metaphysical you know way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.530" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">goes traditional in terms of how a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.180" end="00:29:12.620" style="s2">tradition we just same Heidegger same 42</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:16.400" style="s2">that well you should look at things in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.620" end="00:29:18.500" style="s2">traditional way metaphysics becomes</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.400" end="00:29:20.060" style="s2">something that gets in the way right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.500" end="00:29:22.280" style="s2">what you do right so you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.060" end="00:29:23.540" style="s2">beyond that so that&#39;s why I think and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.280" end="00:29:25.550" style="s2">often this is a boutique of Hagar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.540" end="00:29:28.490" style="s2">being a time it looks like he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.550" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">about God certainly capital B being but</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.490" end="00:29:32.840" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to stay away from the term</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.140" end="00:29:34.520" style="s2">altogether like the traps you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.840" end="00:29:37.250" style="s2">to be sort of metaphysical sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.520" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">things that you can&#39;t get out right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.250" end="00:29:42.530" style="s2">you know that best of excellent or</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:44.210" style="s2">tedium that babies makes him someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.530" end="00:29:47.179" style="s2">that gets champion that they&#39;ve a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.210" end="00:29:49.849" style="s2">hmm or I think more Postma</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.179" end="00:29:55.249" style="s2">theologians but then he gets looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.849" end="00:29:57.229" style="s2">kind of kind of a standoffish sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.249" end="00:29:59.599" style="s2">way by those that like you know wood</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.229" end="00:30:02.210" style="s2">bark are martyrs like you know thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.599" end="00:30:03.589" style="s2">that are uplifting the games God the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.210" end="00:30:07.009" style="s2">that&#39;s the centerpiece of everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.589" end="00:30:08.450" style="s2">right right so there&#39;s some camps here</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.009" end="00:30:11.690" style="s2">you know they quit boat motors County</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.450" end="00:30:13.969" style="s2">between what he&#39;s talking about t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.690" end="00:30:15.469" style="s2">mythologizing baby which is given to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.969" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">same thing taken out of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.469" end="00:30:21.229" style="s2">metaphysical assumptions we have right</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:23.479" style="s2">give it something more pure right trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.229" end="00:30:25.009" style="s2">to as well yeah but they&#39;re but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.479" end="00:30:28.070" style="s2">think that these this thing this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.009" end="00:30:30.519" style="s2">thing is very tricky because to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.070" end="00:30:33.469" style="s2">theology you have to take up the deals</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.519" end="00:30:37.669" style="s2">but to think of the deals requires you</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.469" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">to go back to the root word of POS and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.669" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">be able to think of it in a in a non</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:48.379" style="s2">humanistic way hmm right so all those</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:50.059" style="s2">pieces are all up and dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.379" end="00:30:54.139" style="s2">things that way it becomes treatment</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.059" end="00:30:56.809" style="s2">right feels what if you can&#39;t take me</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.139" end="00:31:00.889" style="s2">into take me into what what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.809" end="00:31:04.219" style="s2">makes Theo&#39;s feels right what what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.889" end="00:31:09.379" style="s2">that what is the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.219" end="00:31:13.539" style="s2">gathers you know and as theology and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.379" end="00:31:13.539" style="s2">everything around that like shine forth</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.169" end="00:31:21.109" style="s2">it&#39;s it depends on it depends on how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.499" end="00:31:23.389" style="s2">sit or heõs within a systematic theology</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.109" end="00:31:25.129" style="s2">structure so like I mentioned I</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.389" end="00:31:28.249" style="s2">mentioned bar bars concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.129" end="00:31:29.269" style="s2">word logos yeah everything that makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.249" end="00:31:34.179" style="s2">the O&#39;s manifest</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.269" end="00:31:34.179" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s Energon in a way that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.219" end="00:31:40.309" style="s2">bolsters the deals yeah do you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.869" end="00:31:42.200" style="s2">other thinkers that might look at in</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.309" end="00:31:44.989" style="s2">terms of history so the trajectory are</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.200" end="00:31:46.759" style="s2">tired with the deals so when does</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.989" end="00:31:48.529" style="s2">history or time began the deals is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.759" end="00:31:55.369" style="s2">something is there first everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.529" end="00:31:57.799" style="s2">spins off of that thinkers like Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.369" end="00:32:00.349" style="s2">Tillich is more concerned with the beam</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.799" end="00:32:01.130" style="s2">of bees like what what is it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.349" end="00:32:03.980" style="s2">underpin</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.130" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">Theo&#39;s yeah yeah we can relate to at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:08.360" style="s2">level of both not yeah it&#39;s gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:11.299" style="s2">their personal thing you know comes kind</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.730" end="00:32:40.630" style="s2">play those things right says like see us</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:43.820" style="s2">and Greek sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.630" end="00:32:47.720" style="s2">extreme sense is more of like that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:49.340" style="s2">God&#39;s eye view right like they create</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.720" end="00:32:50.390" style="s2">something that creates but there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.340" end="00:32:52.700" style="s2">this is something that means something</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.700" end="00:32:55.549" style="s2">know it&#39;s like the the unmoved mover</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.020" end="00:32:57.320" style="s2">it&#39;s something that moves but it does</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.330" end="00:33:08.659" style="s2">so in something so that Theo&#39;s internal</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.419" end="00:33:13.340" style="s2">theology is concerned with the logic the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.659" end="00:33:14.929" style="s2">logos are a bit more so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.340" end="00:33:16.850" style="s2">Heidegger thing kind of gets to later in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.929" end="00:33:22.030" style="s2">his career trying to figure out right</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.850" end="00:33:25.520" style="s2">play more of the logos theological yeah</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.140" end="00:33:38.659" style="s2">with theologians and mystical writings</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.590" end="00:33:42.620" style="s2">is the sense of just the word logos it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.659" end="00:33:47.539" style="s2">so that sense of like a hand that&#39;s GAD</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.620" end="00:33:49.870" style="s2">or it together like I know that like I</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.150" end="00:34:03.980" style="s2">of logos to terrible you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.470" end="00:34:06.919" style="s2">five there&#39;s five you taste and logos</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.980" end="00:34:09.260" style="s2">nominally is a term then used to be a</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:14.350" style="s2">could be low gaan which is of of logos</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:17.510" style="s2">yeah you know or you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.350" end="00:34:19.399" style="s2">logu which is generating of local see</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.510" end="00:34:22.010" style="s2">different versions he&#39;s looking at in</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.450" end="00:36:22.119" style="s2">the divine right something that&#39;s divine</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.830" end="00:36:24.650" style="s2">in the Fiat theistic right and sacred</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.119" end="00:36:26.150" style="s2">and he makes that distinction I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.650" end="00:36:27.860" style="s2">think he gets actually I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.150" end="00:36:31.070" style="s2">think till it gets at that too</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.210" end="00:36:49.100" style="s2">and then the sacred they don&#39;t conceal</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.860" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">and then those two virgins they allow</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.740" end="00:42:42.630" style="s2">those crafts you know the theology and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:43.950" style="s2">Heidegger often looked at me strange</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.630" end="00:42:47.010" style="s2">bedfellows they don&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.950" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">together I think but it takes a person</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.010" end="00:42:53.280" style="s2">to their study theology I study I study</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:56.910" style="s2">Luther history Christian that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:59.220" style="s2">specialize in Paul and studied Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.910" end="00:43:04.049" style="s2">was something that was kind of naturally</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.220" end="00:43:05.170" style="s2">went well all the theology I studied</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.049" end="00:43:08.529" style="s2">initially</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.170" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">the thing and how did you did you come</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.269" end="00:43:39.970" style="s2">realize over time that there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:42.309" style="s2">ways just like it was in the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.970" end="00:43:44.680" style="s2">hundred years of Christian I and I think</p>

<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:44.500" style="s2">really fascinated ranked and informed me</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.339" end="00:44:46.089" style="s2">becoming a theologian along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.500" end="00:44:49.289" style="s2">and then of course the philosophy does</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.089" end="00:44:50.500" style="s2">help me understand theology olive oil</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.289" end="00:44:53.529" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:55.779" style="s2">right so they mutually I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.529" end="00:44:58.769" style="s2">like my understanding of theology when I</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.779" end="00:45:03.519" style="s2">when I read theologians like their</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.769" end="00:45:05.859" style="s2">philosophers it&#39;s really difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.519" end="00:45:08.289" style="s2">draw the clear lines between the two</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.859" end="00:45:10.869" style="s2">that&#39;s very true yeah you look at a look</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.289" end="00:45:13.539" style="s2">at was awesome and acquired us yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.869" end="00:45:15.700" style="s2">know the medieval Baker&#39;s during their</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.539" end="00:45:17.289" style="s2">time all of them were looked at during</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.700" end="00:45:18.490" style="s2">their time as philosophers but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.289" end="00:45:21.160" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.490" end="00:45:23.650" style="s2">this ya know and of course I mean tilaka</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.160" end="00:45:26.920" style="s2">course is that way I mention a rider</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.650" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">Beaumont even McQuarrie who you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.920" end="00:45:32.500" style="s2">who&#39;s one of the the the two they Trent</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:35.470" style="s2">isolated hikers being at time in 62 he</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.500" end="00:45:37.150" style="s2">was a Anglican terms of his background</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.470" end="00:45:39.180" style="s2">but he was very much a philosopher in</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.150" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">terms of his dissertation is on</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.180" end="00:45:46.030" style="s2">Heidegger in Beaumont really good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:48.609" style="s2">so I think you can&#39;t get away from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:50.500" style="s2">I mean I think it&#39;s a good deal Logan</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.609" end="00:45:52.810" style="s2">has to be somewhat of a philosopher you</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.500" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">know I think probably I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.810" end="00:45:56.050" style="s2">Carl Bart was probably ruled over his</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:45:59.950" style="s2">grave and saying that&#39;s very true you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.050" end="00:46:02.200" style="s2">have to yeah look at it from a phyllo</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.950" end="00:46:04.810" style="s2">sort of way in terms of what is what am</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.200" end="00:46:06.490" style="s2">I doing here piece wise yeah it did but</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.810" end="00:46:08.050" style="s2">I think but the reverses course is not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.490" end="00:46:09.849" style="s2">as true I mean philosophers typically</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.050" end="00:46:15.250" style="s2">it&#39;s really true there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.849" end="00:46:17.950" style="s2">for sure for example but I think it has</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.250" end="00:46:21.220" style="s2">to go the theologians become lost</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.950" end="00:46:23.410" style="s2">because I think that ease into howland</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.220" end="00:46:25.000" style="s2">the systematic theology from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.410" end="00:46:28.180" style="s2">philosophical point of view I think it</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.000" end="00:46:29.950" style="s2">makes it more rich thanks first if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.180" end="00:46:31.630" style="s2">can look at these I mean I mentioned</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.069" end="00:47:36.939" style="s2">the sense from you as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.630" end="00:47:39.689" style="s2">about it where didn&#39;t seem like it like</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.380" end="00:47:45.069" style="s2">and it sounds like it it like it just</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.269" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">to like or what was harkening to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.719" end="00:48:02.140" style="s2">right about the theologians it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:04.599" style="s2">because I think when I&#39;m getting about</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.140" end="00:48:07.779" style="s2">being an artist so far just in the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.599" end="00:48:10.529" style="s2">that kind of Herrmann ethically the felt</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.779" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">sense I have of when you speak it is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.529" end="00:48:17.679" style="s2">is that there&#39;s something that Glatt</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:19.900" style="s2">shines forth that that that it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:48:19.900" end="00:48:28.150" style="s2">right we&#39;re it&#39;s more like a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.049" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">you just find your interest in it right</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.150" end="00:48:32.140" style="s2">you kind of go through follow you follow</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:33.579" style="s2">this horizon that keeps moving and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.140" end="00:48:36.179" style="s2">look behind you near like you have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.579" end="00:48:39.099" style="s2">whole body of work and eight books</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.179" end="00:48:41.289" style="s2">you&#39;re still like you&#39;re if anything you</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.099" end="00:48:44.829" style="s2">just articulate like you&#39;re more close</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.289" end="00:48:47.109" style="s2">to the mystery you get that sense with</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.829" end="00:48:47.890" style="s2">you it&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to solve</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.890" end="00:48:51.489" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get close to something</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.479" end="00:48:54.659" style="s2">is that I think I mean there&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.489" end="00:48:56.349" style="s2">that&#39;s my continental philosophy sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.659" end="00:48:59.890" style="s2">sensibilities there I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.349" end="00:49:01.989" style="s2">always trying to figure out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.890" end="00:49:03.759" style="s2">one step further toward to something</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.989" end="00:49:04.839" style="s2">where that something is I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.759" end="00:49:06.759" style="s2">what Heidegger doing the Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.839" end="00:49:08.619" style="s2">constantly concerned with you know on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.759" end="00:49:11.799" style="s2">concealment later in life he goes to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.619" end="00:49:15.339" style="s2">porridge really so he&#39;s getting to these</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.799" end="00:49:17.169" style="s2">things that feed everybody&#39;s experiences</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.339" end="00:49:19.719" style="s2">in the world in ways that speak to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.169" end="00:49:21.339" style="s2">humans in general going further what he</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.719" end="00:49:23.739" style="s2">did in his early career you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.339" end="00:49:26.019" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what I think I try to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.739" end="00:49:28.749" style="s2">is I try to figure out how how I make</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.019" end="00:49:30.579" style="s2">these things you know relevant now and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.749" end="00:49:32.380" style="s2">then be able to speak to them now</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.579" end="00:49:35.109" style="s2">I mean post humanism is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.380" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">work a lot that&#39;s what a big things with</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.109" end="00:49:38.679" style="s2">it right you know you&#39;re not gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:41.439" style="s2">the humor they&#39;re going beyond those</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.679" end="00:49:44.699" style="s2">issues and and lets us know how we</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.439" end="00:49:44.699" style="s2">understand technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.859" end="00:49:50.739" style="s2">right right materiality and those issues</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.279" end="00:49:53.829" style="s2">like that those are all to exit our</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.739" end="00:49:56.109" style="s2">cutting edge that constantly allow</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.829" end="00:49:58.359" style="s2">philosophy to be dragged along I guess</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.109" end="00:49:59.440" style="s2">you can say yeah way because he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.359" end="00:50:00.989" style="s2">to now because it because think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.440" end="00:50:02.890" style="s2">this something we think about philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.989" end="00:50:06.489" style="s2">there&#39;s certain things that have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.890" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">discussed and written about that if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.489" end="00:50:11.529" style="s2">write about those things now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of good about that wiki add</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.529" end="00:50:16.599" style="s2">to it only thing I can do is I can say</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:18.940" style="s2">the world I&#39;m in 2020 there&#39;s only that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.599" end="00:50:22.749" style="s2">gonna have new but what what nuances are</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.940" end="00:50:24.819" style="s2">there to that speaking ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.749" end="00:50:29.319" style="s2">know Sarkar&#39;s not speaking to or</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.819" end="00:50:30.969" style="s2">Schopenhauer you know 18th century or</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.319" end="00:50:32.829" style="s2">19th century and so that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.969" end="00:50:36.279" style="s2">something that motivates me I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.829" end="00:50:38.349" style="s2">trying to figure out how to keep high</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.279" end="00:50:40.029" style="s2">degree at the table yeah and some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.349" end="00:50:41.319" style="s2">these things where he influences</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.029" end="00:50:43.749" style="s2">everybody he&#39;s considered you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.319" end="00:50:45.999" style="s2">obviously one of the most important if</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.749" end="00:50:49.059" style="s2">not we&#39;ll learn a few most important</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.999" end="00:50:50.440" style="s2">philosophers yeah weird era Dom because</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.059" end="00:50:53.289" style="s2">people they focus on their dot anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.440" end="00:50:56.049" style="s2">saying thank you go that way yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.289" end="00:50:59.799" style="s2">thinkers constantly are sighted</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.049" end="00:51:03.069" style="s2">constantly were read translated you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.799" end="00:51:04.809" style="s2">they constantly have new generations</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.069" end="00:51:06.729" style="s2">that are exposing them and finding</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.809" end="00:51:08.229" style="s2">things for them so but with the problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.729" end="00:51:10.029" style="s2">in Heidegger is that there&#39;s often this</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.229" end="00:51:11.579" style="s2">time we want to prevent him from having</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.029" end="00:51:15.279" style="s2">the voice the table because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.579" end="00:51:17.709" style="s2">yeah the fact he wasn&#39;t a good person</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.279" end="00:51:22.959" style="s2">right I think about it but most</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.709" end="00:51:28.029" style="s2">philosophers aren&#39;t known for their</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.959" end="00:51:30.190" style="s2">emotional you would never want to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.029" end="00:51:34.390" style="s2">never want to like them have a talk with</p>
