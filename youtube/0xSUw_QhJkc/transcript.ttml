<p begin="00:00:05.029" end="00:00:11.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had conversations where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:15.450" style="s2">come into the conversation one way and</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.960" end="00:00:16.970" style="s2">something about the dialogue right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.450" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">was super personal maybe was</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.970" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">philosophical but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:26.810" style="s2">about the meeting such that you walked</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:26.810" style="s2">away and you are different somehow</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.650" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">circling you could say is a yoga of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">those kinds of conversations it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.340" style="s2">whatever those asanas those postures and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">communication it&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.340" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">stretching strengthening that muscle</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">that is both available and generative of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:48.829" style="s2">those kinds of unexpected life-changing</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:48.829" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.710" end="00:00:56.260" style="s2">so basically we&#39;ve been on an inquiry in</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:58.870" style="s2">rebel wisdom since starting the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.260" end="00:01:01.540" style="s2">about a a year and a half ago trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.870" end="00:01:04.930" style="s2">sort of see where the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.540" end="00:01:07.090" style="s2">conversation is and found some really</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.930" end="00:01:08.050" style="s2">really fascinating thinkers in that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.090" end="00:01:10.510" style="s2">and had some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.050" end="00:01:12.940" style="s2">conversations why I&#39;m really excited</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.510" end="00:01:14.890" style="s2">about this is that so circling as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.940" end="00:01:17.350" style="s2">practice that&#39;s becoming more popular</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.890" end="00:01:21.460" style="s2">and a lot more people seem to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.350" end="00:01:23.080" style="s2">of it and I guess it&#39;s possibly hard to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.460" end="00:01:25.869" style="s2">describe exactly what it is without it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.080" end="00:01:28.840" style="s2">without doing it but I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.869" end="00:01:32.020" style="s2">my best now and I&#39;d say it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.840" end="00:01:36.220" style="s2">making a conversation self-aware and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.020" end="00:01:38.259" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a form of trying to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.220" end="00:01:40.840" style="s2">to what wants to emerge in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.259" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">and often naming the dynamics that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.840" end="00:01:47.020" style="s2">present in the relationship that allows</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:48.580" style="s2">a deeper level of presence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.020" end="00:01:51.250" style="s2">communication to be there in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.580" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">relationship and there are other as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.250" end="00:01:55.420" style="s2">sure will talk about there are other</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">different modalities for doing that but</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.420" end="00:01:58.780" style="s2">why I think it&#39;s so crucial right now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:01.240" style="s2">that a lot of people and our channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.780" end="00:02:04.270" style="s2">have talked about the need for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.240" end="00:02:08.830" style="s2">collective intelligence as this almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.270" end="00:02:11.739" style="s2">next evolutionary step and I think these</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.830" end="00:02:13.269" style="s2">kind of they&#39;re often called we space</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.739" end="00:02:14.830" style="s2">technologies I&#39;m not sure I like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.269" end="00:02:18.040" style="s2">that term very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.830" end="00:02:20.590" style="s2">no you&#39;re shaking your head as well but</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.040" end="00:02:22.390" style="s2">but there certainly I mean there are no</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.590" end="00:02:24.430" style="s2">in a way there&#39;s no really good language</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.390" end="00:02:27.010" style="s2">for this kind of inter subjective sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.430" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">making is another mouthful it&#39;s like but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.010" end="00:02:33.989" style="s2">I think these are hugely crucial</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">practices that I think our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.989" end="00:02:37.870" style="s2">evolutionarily important so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:40.750" style="s2">interested in this conversation and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.870" end="00:02:44.140" style="s2">what comes out of the dialogue so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.750" end="00:02:47.019" style="s2">love if you could just briefly say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:48.910" style="s2">circling came from and and and how would</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.019" end="00:02:51.850" style="s2">you summarize it so I want to say I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.910" end="00:02:56.049" style="s2">really appreciated your channel and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.850" end="00:02:59.109" style="s2">you&#39;re doing on multiple levels one is</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.049" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">just just the fact that you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.109" end="00:03:03.290" style="s2">for the emergent conversation just just</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:06.909" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.290" end="00:03:10.609" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing is in itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.909" end="00:03:13.189" style="s2">impressive to me and also watching how</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.609" end="00:03:16.609" style="s2">the people that you&#39;re dialoguing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.189" end="00:03:19.010" style="s2">are in some way cause shaping your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.609" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">channel and watching the channel evolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.010" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">and in such a way where it almost feels</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:29.120" style="s2">that the very thing that you have your</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">eye on is is making is making what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.120" end="00:03:33.379" style="s2">emerging a kind of a self-awareness so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:36.109" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like rebel wisdom in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.379" end="00:03:38.920" style="s2">certain sense is this way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.109" end="00:03:41.930" style="s2">which is emerging in the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.920" end="00:03:43.189" style="s2">saying I to itself and asking itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.930" end="00:03:47.389" style="s2">questions and stuff so I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.189" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">appreciated the multi dimensions of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.389" end="00:03:50.750" style="s2">kind of comes through and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:55.329" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing and really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.750" end="00:03:57.530" style="s2">it a lot thank you and I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.329" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">circling for me has been very much the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.530" end="00:04:03.829" style="s2">same thing it&#39;s more like it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:06.439" style="s2">wasn&#39;t anything that that anyone had any</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.829" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">idea of trying to create something right</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.439" end="00:04:12.079" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it was it happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:13.970" style="s2">spontaneously in a moment it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.079" end="00:04:15.379" style="s2">moment of of what you could call his</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.970" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">deep connection and with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.379" end="00:04:21.169" style="s2">friends of ours however stood out from</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:24.729" style="s2">all other moments of deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:28.580" style="s2">with groups of friends of mine in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.729" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">the it&#39;s the depth of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.580" end="00:04:35.000" style="s2">and the connection was a kind of end in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:37.340" style="s2">itself like the value of the connection</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.000" end="00:04:40.210" style="s2">was its own end in a way it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.340" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">shined forth and so in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.210" end="00:04:46.190" style="s2">it was a you know probably a month later</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">when it finally actually somebody called</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.190" end="00:04:50.060" style="s2">like named it circling which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">trying to understand even why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.060" end="00:04:57.340" style="s2">called that right ever since what stood</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:05:00.199" style="s2">out was this what I would imagine you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.340" end="00:05:03.349" style="s2">referred to before is like a we space or</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.199" end="00:05:07.130" style="s2">an inner subjective space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.349" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">distinct and so circling has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.130" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">telling me what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:12.529" style="s2">ever since the beginning and it&#39;s I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:16.700" style="s2">like my job has been to listen deeply to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.529" end="00:05:17.949" style="s2">it and distinguish it from also what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.700" end="00:05:21.259" style="s2">is at</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.949" end="00:05:27.169" style="s2">so it&#39;s I would say that circling one</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.259" end="00:05:30.410" style="s2">way of saying it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.169" end="00:05:34.150" style="s2">inner subjective relational yoga or</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.410" end="00:05:38.630" style="s2">meditation right just like with yoga</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.150" end="00:05:43.340" style="s2">there are all these asanas that develop</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.630" end="00:05:47.630" style="s2">capacities of mind and body that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.340" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">are basically extremes of or archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.630" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">of positions that you have psychically</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:55.400" style="s2">and physically in the world circling is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:57.500" style="s2">you could say is a set of asanas in</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.400" end="00:05:59.990" style="s2">which people get together and they do</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.500" end="00:06:01.669" style="s2">these deep stretches of all the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.990" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">that it takes to be intimate with</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.669" end="00:06:06.050" style="s2">somebody to deeply listen to someone to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:09.289" style="s2">like share the truth of your own</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.050" end="00:06:12.289" style="s2">experience to move into conflict without</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.289" end="00:06:16.190" style="s2">going to war right all of those all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.289" end="00:06:18.410" style="s2">those capacities we do these deep asanas</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.190" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">so that when you&#39;re walking around in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.410" end="00:06:21.169" style="s2">the world and you&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:23.240" style="s2">thinking about whether or not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.169" end="00:06:25.479" style="s2">doing circling when you talk to your mom</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.240" end="00:06:28.460" style="s2">you can enter into that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.479" end="00:06:31.220" style="s2">even on her own terms in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.460" end="00:06:34.630" style="s2">more brings more aliveness and more</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.220" end="00:06:39.500" style="s2">truth and more closeness in authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.630" end="00:06:43.400" style="s2">you know I want to pick up on so we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.500" end="00:06:47.330" style="s2">you familiar with inquiry the as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.400" end="00:06:50.810" style="s2">modality as I am familiar with it as</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.330" end="00:06:53.780" style="s2">parts of modalities like like diamond</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.810" end="00:06:56.300" style="s2">heart exactly it&#39;s the OL mass work so</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.780" end="00:07:00.500" style="s2">the red one school or the Alma&#39;s essence</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.300" end="00:07:02.990" style="s2">work yes which was the main influence on</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.500" end="00:07:06.889" style="s2">the counseling training that that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.990" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve been learning an inquiry so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.889" end="00:07:12.620" style="s2">actually on our retreats get the guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:14.539" style="s2">into a space of inquiry and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.620" end="00:07:18.259" style="s2">we frame it is as a kind of talking</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.259" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s happening at the moment as</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.750" end="00:07:25.580" style="s2">we&#39;re talking and there&#39;s a word that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:29.029" style="s2">that I think is very powerful in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.580" end="00:07:31.040" style="s2">space and that&#39;s curiosity this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.029" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">being curious because in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.040" end="00:07:35.990" style="s2">place it in that word is one there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a not knowing there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:44.570" style="s2">and that sort of opening up to curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.990" end="00:07:47.480" style="s2">and then in a recent film we just put</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.570" end="00:07:50.420" style="s2">out called the science and psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.480" end="00:07:53.300" style="s2">polarization we we spoke with Stephen</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.300" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">and with Peter Levine who came at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.130" end="00:08:01.760" style="s2">somatic experiencing and Stephen Porges</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:04.730" style="s2">why I think he&#39;s a very interesting</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.730" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">Theory came up with the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.890" end="00:08:13.190" style="s2">scientific background of why curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:15.530" style="s2">is so important because curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.190" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">defensiveness cannot exist at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.530" end="00:08:21.590" style="s2">time that our physiology is wired</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:23.480" style="s2">towards either expansion curiosity the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.590" end="00:08:25.460" style="s2">possibility of something new or</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">that I&#39;m reminded of what Maximus the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.550" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">Confessor seventh I think he was lived</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:43.340" style="s2">in like 1700s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:45.890" style="s2">he said he described like you could say</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.340" end="00:08:47.780" style="s2">the ground of consciousness the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.890" end="00:08:51.640" style="s2">ontological ground of consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.780" end="00:08:55.160" style="s2">as he would put it as an existential</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.160" end="00:09:01.400" style="s2">givenness being right that kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.760" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">fundamental sense of where a where I it</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.400" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">seems to me that what we tap into in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">these modalities like inquiry or</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:13.730" style="s2">circling is it&#39;s not just something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">we do like an act like I&#39;m someone that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.730" end="00:09:18.050" style="s2">then acts and is then curious there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:21.610" style="s2">way in which curiosity could be a way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.050" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">distancing but when one finds oneself</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.610" end="00:09:28.760" style="s2">interested in something right like</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:31.550" style="s2">deeply struck by something to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.760" end="00:09:34.030" style="s2">something so primordial to that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.550" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">like so primordial to the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.030" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">awareness itself is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:42.060" style="s2">awareness this is always aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:45.660" style="s2">world it&#39;s coupled with the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.060" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a way in which like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.660" end="00:09:50.630" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about when one is feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:53.550" style="s2">safe when one feels deeply considered</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.630" end="00:09:56.910" style="s2">one can relax into the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.550" end="00:09:59.900" style="s2">in what is just there in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.910" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">is something like curiosity or interest</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.900" end="00:10:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s those those two things between I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:10.400" style="s2">noticed safety right safety and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.200" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">curiosity seem to be go hand-in-hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.400" end="00:10:15.270" style="s2">when there&#39;s danger when the well like</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.770" style="s2">the relationship breaks down and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.270" end="00:10:18.870" style="s2">other part of your nervous system gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.770" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">spread up I noticed curiosity is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.870" end="00:10:23.730" style="s2">last thing that goes on I&#39;m curious as</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.230" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">hell about you until you don&#39;t give me</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.730" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2">what I want or you pissed me off right</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:31.010" style="s2">then I know exactly who you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">so those two things between openness</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.010" end="00:10:37.080" style="s2">safety and interest and curiosity seem</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:39.390" style="s2">to go hand-in-hand to me in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.080" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">are I think are really quite mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.390" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">and deep hmm yeah you are you familiar</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:48.090" style="s2">with polyvagal theory and the Steven</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:51.810" style="s2">Porges work yes yeah I&#39;m familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.090" end="00:10:55.260" style="s2">it you&#39;re sure yeah yeah I loved how he</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.810" end="00:10:57.960" style="s2">talked about the the neurophysiology of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.260" end="00:10:59.610" style="s2">spirituality or religion that if there</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.960" end="00:11:02.610" style="s2">was a sit there&#39;s a synthesis even in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.610" end="00:11:04.740" style="s2">that perspective that that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.610" end="00:11:07.320" style="s2">underpins a sort of philosophical view</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.740" end="00:11:10.140" style="s2">and and in some ways a religious view of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.320" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">the world yes yeah we&#39;re these these</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.140" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">places in which this is what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:15.900" style="s2">interesting what I&#39;m watching on your</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.140" end="00:11:18.600" style="s2">channel are lots of people making these</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.900" end="00:11:21.690" style="s2">biological connections to all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:23.310" style="s2">other dimensions of human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.690" end="00:11:27.570" style="s2">there&#39;s something about when all those</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.310" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">line up that kind of shines forth in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.570" end="00:11:35.070" style="s2">way that seems super necessary for in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:37.470" style="s2">today&#39;s society in culture for it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.070" end="00:11:41.010" style="s2">actually grab hold and for people to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.470" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">trust it yeah so those those those deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.010" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">biological links are and especially the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:53.550" style="s2">connectedness to embodiment right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:55.590" style="s2">that there&#39;s a some kind of there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.550" end="00:11:59.070" style="s2">kind of logos even</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.590" end="00:12:01.260" style="s2">my nervous system yeah I mean the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.070" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">that is coming up when you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.260" end="00:12:07.860" style="s2">is and you said connectedness and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:11.100" style="s2">is synthesis there&#39;s this sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:14.370" style="s2">need for synthesis mmm it&#39;s being called</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:16.110" style="s2">out right now and there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.370" end="00:12:18.420" style="s2">intellectual synthesis there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.110" end="00:12:22.920" style="s2">of the sort of having lost the deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.420" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">mythos that something is something</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.920" end="00:12:26.850" style="s2">desperately needs to be born in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:30.110" style="s2">space well we&#39;re really feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.850" end="00:12:33.860" style="s2">absence of that but then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.110" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s a risk of that being</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:41.310" style="s2">disconnected from the body of that not</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">being embodied and the of that only bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.310" end="00:12:45.390" style="s2">yeah only being an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.860" style="s2">synthesis is sort of is lacking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.390" end="00:12:48.450" style="s2">not going to touch the sides I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:51.000" style="s2">what we&#39;re needing right now is a much</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.450" end="00:12:54.840" style="s2">deeper synthesis than that yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.000" end="00:12:57.990" style="s2">think a lot of the but in some sense it</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.840" end="00:12:59.730" style="s2">also can&#39;t really be named that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.990" end="00:13:03.830" style="s2">a sense of a lot of people on our</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:06.480" style="s2">channel talking about something or</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.830" end="00:13:08.580" style="s2">almost in code but in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.480" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">can&#39;t really name it precisely you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.580" end="00:13:14.070" style="s2">kind of name the outlines of it you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">name what it isn&#39;t but you can&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.070" end="00:13:19.830" style="s2">the emergent thing that is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">we&#39;re all in some sense aware of and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.830" end="00:13:27.330" style="s2">trying to stay alive too and I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:28.890" style="s2">liked just to I was just listening to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.330" end="00:13:31.580" style="s2">your conversation with John Vevey key</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.890" end="00:13:37.320" style="s2">you you mentioned something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.580" end="00:13:39.810" style="s2">circling is about what is most alive and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.320" end="00:13:41.310" style="s2">he let he then linked that to evolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.810" end="00:13:45.140" style="s2">but that was almost an eeveelution airy</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.310" end="00:13:45.140" style="s2">process there&#39;s almost like a natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.230" end="00:13:49.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a natural imperative to be on</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:52.500" style="s2">that edge where everything is most alive</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.590" end="00:13:54.510" style="s2">yes and at the end is it like at the end</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.500" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">of that conversation was really in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.510" end="00:14:00.810" style="s2">I would say that interview is a very in</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:03.510" style="s2">a certain way is an example of what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.810" end="00:14:05.370" style="s2">would call circling right that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.510" end="00:14:09.200" style="s2">there is his way where his ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.370" end="00:14:11.810" style="s2">what was so true for him personally</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.200" end="00:14:13.670" style="s2">really kind of cake they synthesized and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.810" end="00:14:15.290" style="s2">came together especially at the end and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.670" end="00:14:17.329" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about those</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.290" end="00:14:19.579" style="s2">things coming together that look you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.329" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">watch both of our hearts just open with</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.579" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2">each other where it wasn&#39;t just some</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">personal growth epiphany right or</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:35.540" style="s2">insights about oneself it was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:38.570" style="s2">a recognition of that of two things</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.540" end="00:14:41.389" style="s2">coming together but recognizing it as</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.570" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">they come together that&#39;s what was so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.389" end="00:14:45.589" style="s2">beautiful for me and what I see often</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.440" style="s2">over and over and over and over again</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.440" end="00:14:55.339" style="s2">why what you&#39;re the exact reason what</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.110" end="00:14:56.810" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that sense or even</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.339" end="00:14:58.459" style="s2">when you were going to talk when he</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.810" end="00:15:00.709" style="s2">started talking about synthesis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.459" end="00:15:03.620" style="s2">this way where you went he stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.709" end="00:15:05.870" style="s2">he went and almost like you were both</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.620" end="00:15:08.089" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking but I also got this</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.870" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">sense at least my response to you as I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.089" end="00:15:15.649" style="s2">thought I was also feeling with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:19.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense and sense is such a key</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.649" end="00:15:22.339" style="s2">word right because sense in both</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.579" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">connotates sensation the givenness of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.339" end="00:15:26.420" style="s2">sensations right in feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">sensations but it also has it makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.420" end="00:15:33.649" style="s2">sense right so it&#39;s this link between</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:36.230" style="s2">the you know the cognitive and the end</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.649" end="00:15:37.940" style="s2">the physical so when I have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.230" end="00:15:40.130" style="s2">something so in a certain way you could</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.940" end="00:15:43.990" style="s2">say that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.130" end="00:15:49.070" style="s2">authentic relationship or the space of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.990" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">we is a place of sense right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.070" end="00:15:55.959" style="s2">place where were not just pontificating</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:59.480" style="s2">and trying to talk over each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.959" end="00:16:02.510" style="s2">you know a victory over idea but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.480" end="00:16:06.199" style="s2">actual this awareness that were both I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.329" end="00:16:32.809" style="s2">um that is demonstrates of courage and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.149" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">and so when I when when the other person</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.809" end="00:16:37.209" style="s2">registers the impact like that they say</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:41.209" style="s2">something that actually they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.209" end="00:16:43.639" style="s2">viscerally feel me adjusting my</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.209" end="00:16:46.429" style="s2">worldview or adjusting how I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.639" end="00:16:48.589" style="s2">myself or you or my life making more</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.429" end="00:16:51.410" style="s2">sense to me through hearing what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.589" end="00:16:53.269" style="s2">just shared with me what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.410" end="00:16:55.879" style="s2">is that the other person has this</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.269" end="00:16:58.699" style="s2">incredible feeling of feeling heard of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.879" end="00:17:01.879" style="s2">feeling seen a feeling understood so</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.699" end="00:17:06.380" style="s2">there&#39;s this link between me feeling</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.879" end="00:17:08.659" style="s2">seen heard and understood through you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.380" end="00:17:11.179" style="s2">being willing to be altered and affected</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.659" end="00:17:14.539" style="s2">by what I just said or the way I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.179" end="00:17:17.899" style="s2">was for you and then was circling we</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.539" end="00:17:20.600" style="s2">highlight that change live as that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.899" end="00:17:22.459" style="s2">happening as an actual experience and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.600" end="00:17:23.569" style="s2">one of the things that that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.459" end="00:17:26.149" style="s2">of that interview that I just thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.569" end="00:17:29.750" style="s2">was so gorgeous is so it was so gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.149" end="00:17:31.519" style="s2">where John was talking about where he</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.750" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2">grew up in it like a religious</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.519" end="00:17:37.940" style="s2">fundamentalism and and he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:40.820" style="s2">about always being feeling like this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.940" end="00:17:43.010" style="s2">this power could reject him at any</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.820" end="00:17:46.029" style="s2">moment and he was saying there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.010" end="00:17:49.029" style="s2">danger in that though for me because</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.029" end="00:17:49.029" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.400" end="00:17:54.470" style="s2">that intense ideology that he lived</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:56.390" style="s2">inside of was also a kind of holding in</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.470" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">which that gave him a personal narrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.390" end="00:18:02.780" style="s2">to live inside of and that what that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.650" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">he&#39;s he was he was identifying the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">danger of falling into that with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:13.160" style="s2">sense of I that comes with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:15.560" style="s2">dogma and what we ended up talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">was and I really got a stronger sense in</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.560" end="00:18:20.600" style="s2">the conversation it really impacted me</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">as I&#39;m trying to articulate right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">through having heard him right is and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:28.280" style="s2">here&#39;s the inner subjectivity right here</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:32.240" style="s2">is what I&#39;m talking about is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.280" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">holding actually could be the process of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.240" end="00:18:39.950" style="s2">mutual fitted discs the process of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:41.660" style="s2">activity of constantly finding each</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.950" end="00:18:43.670" style="s2">other and adjusting each other and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.660" end="00:18:47.090" style="s2">contributing to each other in proactive</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.670" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">vulnerable ways that lead to more</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.090" end="00:18:52.250" style="s2">stability so it&#39;s so a promise of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:54.650" style="s2">antifragile</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.250" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s almost an anti fragile conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.650" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">yes absolutely it is and I wonder just</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:03.380" style="s2">to just to kind of ground it a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:05.060" style="s2">bit for people maybe who are watching</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.380" end="00:19:06.530" style="s2">who are who are not familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.060" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.530" end="00:19:13.460" style="s2">I I would say I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:18.770" style="s2">making the conversation self-aware in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.460" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">terms of I mean what I&#39;m I mean I I know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.770" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">means call myself an expert but I&#39;m but</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:26.680" style="s2">I&#39;m very aware of how it feels to name</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">the dynamics in a conversation or to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.680" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">once-once any net anything in in any</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">relationship even once we&#39;ve named the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.270" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">dynamics and the relationship something</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:39.670" style="s2">lands and something becomes much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:42.860" style="s2">clear and as soon as when that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.670" end="00:19:45.080" style="s2">identified there&#39;s an odd nurse there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.860" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">a there&#39;s a sense of some things here</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.080" end="00:19:48.740" style="s2">but I&#39;m not entirely sure what it is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:51.110" style="s2">as soon as that is named it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.740" end="00:19:52.280" style="s2">actually this is how I&#39;m feeling or this</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.110" end="00:19:55.960" style="s2">is what&#39;s present for me right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.280" end="00:19:59.450" style="s2">suddenly there is a landing yeah and my</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.960" end="00:20:01.820" style="s2">my mentor is a guy called raffia Morgan</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.450" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">who has been doing a lot of this work</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.820" end="00:20:06.470" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">probably the 70s or the 80s and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.470" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">about everything registering in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:14.870" style="s2">field that that is is a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:17.510" style="s2">way of looking at it and it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.870" end="00:20:19.490" style="s2">true whatever is being thought that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.510" end="00:20:21.260" style="s2">not expressed is still present in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.490" end="00:20:23.000" style="s2">field it&#39;s still present in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.260" end="00:20:26.600" style="s2">relationships between people it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.000" end="00:20:29.960" style="s2">present if some things are expressed say</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.600" end="00:20:31.790" style="s2">if we&#39;re in a even a working environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.960" end="00:20:34.730" style="s2">cuz we make this very much part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.790" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">process between myself and Ally and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.730" end="00:20:40.550" style="s2">rebel wisdom we&#39;re constantly in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.830" style="s2">process with each other of surfacing</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.550" end="00:20:46.370" style="s2">whatever dynamics are there whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.830" end="00:20:48.110" style="s2">going on in sort of internally because</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.370" end="00:20:51.020" style="s2">we know that if we don&#39;t do that then</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.110" end="00:20:52.970" style="s2">then things start to the organization</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.020" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">itself starts to develop a sort of lack</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.970" end="00:20:57.680" style="s2">of congruence or it develops an</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:20:59.420" style="s2">underbelly or like we&#39;ve become very</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.680" end="00:21:01.100" style="s2">aware of that and it&#39;s so when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.420" end="00:21:02.540" style="s2">aware of something we surface it and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.100" end="00:21:05.810" style="s2">go through this process with each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.540" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">and I think right and that&#39;s the same I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.810" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">guess in any relationship like in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:13.420" style="s2">intimate relationship I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:18.440" style="s2">such an important practice to to learn</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.420" end="00:21:21.130" style="s2">I&#39;m curious for you when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.440" end="00:21:25.720" style="s2">about so what I heard you say is is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.130" end="00:21:27.590" style="s2">everything in the field registers hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.720" end="00:21:30.530" style="s2">there is something that you said that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.590" end="00:21:34.280" style="s2">just caught my interest is like so when</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.530" end="00:21:37.730" style="s2">I named it hmm what&#39;s what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.280" end="00:21:40.190" style="s2">naming it that seems so crucial so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.730" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">crucial such that you make sure it have</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.190" end="00:21:44.300" style="s2">it be a practice and what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:49.490" style="s2">with your team hmm what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.300" end="00:21:52.040" style="s2">naming it in like Whitney what happens</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.490" end="00:21:53.720" style="s2">to the field or what what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.040" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">you name it versus say if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.720" end="00:21:58.610" style="s2">name it</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:22:02.660" style="s2">what is it naming it do this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.610" end="00:22:06.560" style="s2">a very interesting inquiry I I connect</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.660" end="00:22:09.290" style="s2">it to something like this maybe as an</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.560" end="00:22:12.350" style="s2">analysis I mean how it feels is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.290" end="00:22:15.860" style="s2">relaxation how it feels is a relaxation</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.350" end="00:22:16.850" style="s2">because part of me I guess was already</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:22.610" style="s2">was present naming it is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.930" end="00:22:24.950" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what I was feeling well</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.610" end="00:22:27.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what was there because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.950" end="00:22:31.040" style="s2">on the fringes of awareness but but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.470" end="00:22:33.380" style="s2">in the process of naming it somehow it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.040" end="00:22:36.950" style="s2">becomes concretize dit becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.380" end="00:22:38.780" style="s2">it becomes a it&#39;s sort of there&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.950" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">something quite deep there about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.780" end="00:22:46.760" style="s2">shift between awareness and conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:49.900" style="s2">thought but there is there is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.760" end="00:22:52.790" style="s2">of dynamic with us as meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.900" end="00:22:55.490" style="s2">animals who have this tool of language</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.790" end="00:22:58.850" style="s2">that is somehow about concretizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.490" end="00:23:02.150" style="s2">thoughts that means when we concretize</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.850" end="00:23:04.250" style="s2">it it makes a shift now and there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.150" end="00:23:06.380" style="s2">some deep sort of theological thing as</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.250" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">well I think I mean Christianity should</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.380" end="00:23:11.930" style="s2">have been the beginning was the word</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">there is something I mean I I&#39;m reaching</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.930" end="00:23:16.850" style="s2">here these are thoughts that I have but</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:20.540" style="s2">maybe never expressed there is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.850" end="00:23:23.780" style="s2">about like in some way I think we are in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.540" end="00:23:27.080" style="s2">tension life is in tension in carne it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.780" end="00:23:32.120" style="s2">is in tension and words are in tension</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.080" end="00:23:34.730" style="s2">and so by identic reiated principle is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.120" end="00:23:39.710" style="s2">identified with the word in some way so</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.730" end="00:23:42.110" style="s2">when we when we name things we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.710" end="00:23:45.050" style="s2">them more real or this there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.110" end="00:23:47.420" style="s2">of shift that happens like an only I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.050" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">only really explain in from a felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.420" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">perspective of something relaxes in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">field yes just everyone knows their</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:57.920" style="s2">place everything is suddenly it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:23:59.990" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what&#39;s going on and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.920" end="00:24:02.600" style="s2">an immense act of bravery often in doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.990" end="00:24:04.070" style="s2">that because usually the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.600" end="00:24:06.950" style="s2">in the field that are not being named</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.070" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">are things that are difficult to name or</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.950" end="00:24:11.710" style="s2">things that are difficult to accept</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:14.690" style="s2">about oneself or difficult to name about</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:20.210" style="s2">some someone else does that that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.690" end="00:24:23.330" style="s2">of I mean I feel yeah and I feel as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.210" end="00:24:25.940" style="s2">that sense of slipping into an out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.330" end="00:24:27.620" style="s2">this sense of inquiry as well like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.940" end="00:24:29.540" style="s2">feel it in myself when I could when I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:30.710" style="s2">feel that that I&#39;m I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.540" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">listening to myself too</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.710" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">or can it and I&#39;m I&#39;m having I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:37.580" style="s2">actually interested in what comes out</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:40.789" style="s2">there&#39;s a very definite difference there</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.580" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">between telling a story that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.789" end="00:24:45.110" style="s2">know quite well there&#39;s quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:48.649" style="s2">digression but I think I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.110" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">your thoughts well I just well one when</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.649" end="00:24:53.539" style="s2">you said when you said these are just</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:57.770" style="s2">been thoughts that I&#39;ve never put the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.539" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">language before it I felt very present</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.770" end="00:25:05.000" style="s2">to a distinctive spaced leg of of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">whatever that space is of where yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something on some level that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:13.690" style="s2">somehow in relationship to I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:16.100" style="s2">know that there&#39;s thoughts I&#39;ve had but</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.690" end="00:25:18.740" style="s2">when I come to terms with it but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.100" end="00:25:21.260" style="s2">never come to terms with them that like</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.740" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">to come to terms with something right is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.260" end="00:25:25.820" style="s2">a really interesting way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:30.169" style="s2">about it so I just known as I was on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.820" end="00:25:33.559" style="s2">edge of my seat but it also felt a sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.169" end="00:25:37.010" style="s2">of space a spaciousness in some way in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.559" end="00:25:44.299" style="s2">relaxation yeah I think that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.010" end="00:25:47.450" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of well I think a one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.299" end="00:25:49.429" style="s2">one of the things that I want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.450" end="00:25:51.799" style="s2">well what is it what is it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.429" end="00:25:53.330" style="s2">not doing when you name the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.799" end="00:25:59.179" style="s2">in the space that doesn&#39;t have a word</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.330" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">for it right I think a lot of times the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.179" end="00:26:06.529" style="s2">the reason I don&#39;t say what&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:09.980" style="s2">that&#39;s whatever&#39;s in the feel there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.529" end="00:26:12.140" style="s2">feeling or a thought or a hunch or I see</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.980" end="00:26:13.940" style="s2">something in somebody else that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.140" end="00:26:18.020" style="s2">quite line up with me or something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.940" end="00:26:21.020" style="s2">that when I don&#39;t say it it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.020" end="00:26:25.580" style="s2">that what I&#39;m actually doing on some</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.020" end="00:26:30.289" style="s2">level is I&#39;m managing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.580" end="00:26:33.110" style="s2">my own perception of myself in your head</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.289" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">so one of the things about circling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.110" end="00:26:39.590" style="s2">just kind of listening to it and doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:42.919" style="s2">it was really realizing how complex it</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.590" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">is to be with another being there are so</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.919" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">much going on and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:52.749" style="s2">going on is is being another for others</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:57.259" style="s2">the sense of that on some level I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.749" end="00:27:00.409" style="s2">tracking who I think you think that I am</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.259" end="00:27:02.749" style="s2">and that if I&#39;m really if I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.409" end="00:27:06.019" style="s2">identified with that you think of me a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.749" end="00:27:08.029" style="s2">particular way right then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.019" end="00:27:11.239" style="s2">sudden whatever I say or don&#39;t say is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.029" end="00:27:13.789" style="s2">gonna be about managing that hmm a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.239" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">of times what I risk or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.789" end="00:27:19.940" style="s2">vulnerability that happens right is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:21.889" style="s2">it is as I&#39;m actually getting ready to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.940" end="00:27:24.649" style="s2">say something that like actually to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.889" end="00:27:26.239" style="s2">degree that it&#39;s authentic it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.649" end="00:27:29.989" style="s2">degree that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.239" end="00:27:31.489" style="s2">happen next and I&#39;ve noticed that it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.989" end="00:27:33.619" style="s2">like when somebody says all right you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.489" end="00:27:34.940" style="s2">know every people listening it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.619" end="00:27:36.259" style="s2">all those moments where you&#39;re like all</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.940" end="00:27:39.109" style="s2">right I&#39;m gonna be really honest here</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.259" end="00:27:41.539" style="s2">and there&#39;s at a liveness that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.109" end="00:27:43.609" style="s2">in that fear and that anxiety basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.539" end="00:27:45.889" style="s2">what that means is I&#39;m about ready I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.609" end="00:27:49.369" style="s2">now officially using speech not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.889" end="00:27:51.769" style="s2">control but actually to relate meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.369" end="00:27:54.049" style="s2">when I get done talking I&#39;m officially</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.769" end="00:27:56.059" style="s2">gonna meet the unknown because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.049" end="00:27:57.859" style="s2">know what&#39;s gonna happen next and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.059" end="00:28:03.289" style="s2">especially don&#39;t know what you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.859" end="00:28:04.999" style="s2">think of me yeah that there&#39;s a link</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.289" end="00:28:09.980" style="s2">that just came up when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.999" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">about the stronger ones identity is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.980" end="00:28:15.289" style="s2">harder it is to enter into this space</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:19.489" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a there&#39;s a link</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.289" end="00:28:23.629" style="s2">here with so we&#39;ve covered the the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.489" end="00:28:25.129" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.629" end="00:28:27.139" style="s2">excitement at the beginning was this</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.129" end="00:28:28.970" style="s2">sense of kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.139" end="00:28:34.850" style="s2">exploration and maybe people changing</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.970" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">their minds and my my sense is if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.850" end="00:28:39.950" style="s2">really established yourself as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">name like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.950" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">this intellectual exploration where</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:45.530" style="s2">you&#39;re really sort of allowing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:48.500" style="s2">to be changed by what other people are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.530" end="00:28:52.190" style="s2">saying is much harder to do because if</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.500" end="00:28:54.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve established yourself as with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.190" end="00:28:56.750" style="s2">certain position if you&#39;ve got any kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.890" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">of public profile I think in particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.750" end="00:29:03.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very very hard to enter in this to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.400" style="s2">this kind of dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.800" end="00:29:08.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard anyway just to enter</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.690" end="00:29:13.040" style="s2">into this kind of dialogue in in public</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.630" end="00:29:15.920" style="s2">. and also i know one of the people we</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.040" end="00:29:19.370" style="s2">have on the channel jordan Greenhalgh</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.920" end="00:29:23.240" style="s2">talks about this quite a lot how in a</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.240" end="00:29:28.850" style="s2">AMEX if you show up with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.840" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">openness and this kind of attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.850" end="00:29:34.010" style="s2">someone else shows up with a I want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:36.920" style="s2">beat you in a debate I want to prove</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.010" end="00:29:41.000" style="s2">that I&#39;m right then you&#39;re the sucker in</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.620" end="00:29:49.250" style="s2">because this is inherently a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:54.650" style="s2">intimacy in a level of trust and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.790" end="00:29:58.910" style="s2">very hard to have that level of intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.650" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">and Trust in the public sphere because</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.910" end="00:30:02.540" style="s2">there isn&#39;t that kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:03.770" style="s2">safety a lot of the time especially if</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.540" end="00:30:07.940" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually gonna be talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.770" end="00:30:10.250" style="s2">about is a is a any kind of a charged</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:12.800" style="s2">topic where people are really identified</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.250" end="00:30:16.780" style="s2">with certain perspectives I really</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.800" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">appreciate what you&#39;re saying I a lot um</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.780" end="00:30:21.350" style="s2">yeah because to be part to be a public</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">figure especially at this particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.350" end="00:30:26.120" style="s2">time but I don&#39;t even think we have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.309" style="s2">in a time like this I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.120" end="00:30:30.800" style="s2">have a time where there&#39;s such that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.309" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">have a history for so it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.800" end="00:30:36.200" style="s2">to even understand at all what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:40.160" style="s2">on right but to be a public finger today</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.200" end="00:30:43.790" style="s2">I you know I have to say that I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.160" end="00:30:46.130" style="s2">say I&#39;ve been very impressed with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.790" end="00:30:50.360" style="s2">Peterson in the way he&#39;s encountered it</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.130" end="00:30:52.250" style="s2">right and what I basically heard him the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.360" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">way I think I&#39;ve seen him encounter is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.250" end="00:30:59.090" style="s2">he&#39;s not responding to the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:01.520" style="s2">downstream Indian you endows or</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.090" end="00:31:03.500" style="s2">intentions of the interviewer he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.520" end="00:31:05.240" style="s2">when somebody when he kind of gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.500" end="00:31:06.500" style="s2">somebody&#39;s trying to corner him he just</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.240" end="00:31:09.380" style="s2">will just stay right where he is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.500" end="00:31:11.809" style="s2">and it&#39;ll just bring it back into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.380" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">unarguable right no that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.809" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">saying and he&#39;s been done a great job at</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:19.040" style="s2">like being like sovereign in that way in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:22.250" style="s2">pressive Lee so I mean I&#39;m like god I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.040" end="00:31:24.050" style="s2">don&#39;t what it takes to do that at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.250" end="00:31:27.130" style="s2">level he&#39;s doing that especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.050" end="00:31:29.510" style="s2">understanding his temperament right is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.130" end="00:31:33.050" style="s2">compassionate and more it can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.510" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2">agreeable like I just kudos for him the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.050" end="00:31:39.920" style="s2">opportunity I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve often thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:43.100" style="s2">in interviews another possibility in</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.920" end="00:31:45.680" style="s2">minute would be to actually shift the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.100" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">level of the logical level of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.680" end="00:31:49.670" style="s2">conversation right which what would</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:51.920" style="s2">happen if we just actually named the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.670" end="00:31:54.200" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s going on hmm</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.920" end="00:31:56.570" style="s2">you know and we just went to a different</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.200" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">level of an arguable missus like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.570" end="00:32:02.030" style="s2">like whoa hang on a second I showed up</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:03.830" style="s2">thinking that you&#39;re genuinely wanting</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.030" end="00:32:07.130" style="s2">to know what I was saying however it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.830" end="00:32:08.900" style="s2">seems to me that I&#39;m being paid into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.130" end="00:32:11.480" style="s2">corner at least how I&#39;m perceiving that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.900" end="00:32:12.410" style="s2">is that like is that what&#39;s happening am</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.480" end="00:32:16.280" style="s2">I wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.410" end="00:32:19.160" style="s2">like what like yeah so where do you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.280" end="00:32:21.230" style="s2">me to go in just moving the level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.160" end="00:32:24.260" style="s2">conversation down and staying to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.230" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">level of unarguable ness in the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.260" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">naming the game that has been played</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:31.370" style="s2">being played as it&#39;s being played yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:33.020" style="s2">totally yeah it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.370" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">that that&#39;s something that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.020" end="00:32:37.310" style="s2">Peterson you know the famous interview</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.760" end="00:32:39.620" style="s2">you have with Kathy Newman yes yes he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.310" end="00:32:41.750" style="s2">actually after that so there was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.620" end="00:32:44.210" style="s2">famous moment where he said where she</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.750" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">asked him about freedom of speech and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.210" end="00:32:47.660" style="s2">said well you have to have the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:49.370" style="s2">to offend otherwise you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.660" end="00:32:51.350" style="s2">freedom to think and as a journalist you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.370" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">should know this and she was lost for</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.350" end="00:32:58.400" style="s2">words and he said gotcha afterwards to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:33:00.710" style="s2">his credit he he he said I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.400" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">have said gotcha I should have used that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:07.340" style="s2">moment you say okay can we have a real</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:09.020" style="s2">conversation you&#39;ve been playing this</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.340" end="00:33:10.580" style="s2">role I&#39;ve been playing this role can we</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.020" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">actually now have a conversation which I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.580" end="00:33:14.300" style="s2">think what you&#39;re what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.040" style="s2">yeah in that little moment that little</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.300" end="00:33:18.890" style="s2">moment you&#39;re right was a window where</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.040" end="00:33:20.690" style="s2">she was actually won&#39;t it actually I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.890" end="00:33:22.370" style="s2">make a distinction there I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.690" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">she was vulnerable I think she was</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.370" end="00:33:25.670" style="s2">exposed</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:28.100" style="s2">there was an opport there was an</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.670" end="00:33:30.020" style="s2">opportunity to invite vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.100" end="00:33:30.710" style="s2">for me there&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.020" end="00:33:34.070" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.710" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">posed and being vulnerable exposure has</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.070" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">that element of like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.260" end="00:33:39.230" style="s2">usually why people are so scared of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:41.630" style="s2">being vulnerable because it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.230" end="00:33:43.159" style="s2">they associated with you know your pants</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.630" end="00:33:45.620" style="s2">being like pulled down at you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.159" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">recess and everyone laughing at you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.620" end="00:33:50.679" style="s2">got this element of this happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:53.059" style="s2">and I&#39;m suddenly exposed to the elements</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.679" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">vulnerability seems to be a volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.059" end="00:33:57.049" style="s2">Ness it&#39;s like it takes a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:33:59.059" style="s2">of courage where I&#39;m really aware of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.049" end="00:34:01.669" style="s2">risk that I&#39;m taking and I&#39;m choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.059" end="00:34:05.539" style="s2">take it there&#39;s a surrender yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.669" end="00:34:08.300" style="s2">absolutely absolutely and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.539" end="00:34:10.580" style="s2">surrender and this is why this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.300" end="00:34:13.399" style="s2">important part it&#39;s a surrender that</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.580" end="00:34:16.790" style="s2">although I&#39;m vulnerable because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.399" end="00:34:20.179" style="s2">doing it voluntarily whatever happens</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.790" end="00:34:22.849" style="s2">after that right will have be much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.179" end="00:34:25.159" style="s2">likely to be strengthening instability</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.849" end="00:34:28.750" style="s2">like being bringing one more into</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.159" end="00:34:32.500" style="s2">stability and so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.750" end="00:34:35.030" style="s2">following what&#39;s most alive fray is</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.500" end="00:34:38.659" style="s2">identifying those moments where you feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.030" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">a felt sense of like Oh whatever&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.659" end="00:34:44.599" style="s2">here right now if I stepped into it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">now stepping beyond my my own frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.599" end="00:34:48.440" style="s2">right in a way that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:52.669" style="s2">gonna happen next</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.440" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">however to do so really takes a choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.669" end="00:34:57.740" style="s2">in a sense of sovereignty and so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:35:00.650" style="s2">sense of sovereignty goes to communion</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.740" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">in communion right then deepens your</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.650" end="00:35:06.410" style="s2">sovereignty that which goes to communion</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:08.810" style="s2">and you have those that cycle happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.410" end="00:35:14.619" style="s2">and you could say that circling or inner</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.810" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">subjective practices are all about</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.619" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">enacting that and becoming better and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:24.940" style="s2">better and better and better and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:28.130" style="s2">practiced at big my way yeah I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.940" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">to pick up you mentioned Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.130" end="00:35:31.849" style="s2">and also you mentioned something similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:34.369" style="s2">in the conversation with John Beauvais</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.849" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">key and I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.369" end="00:35:40.099" style="s2">similarity in the way that they both</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:42.349" style="s2">show up as lecturers there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.099" end="00:35:44.270" style="s2">aliveness to the way that they are I</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.349" end="00:35:44.570" style="s2">felt that with Jordan Peterson before</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.270" end="00:35:45.770" style="s2">and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.570" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">reflected that to John in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.770" end="00:35:52.040" style="s2">conversation with him that even when</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:56.300" style="s2">they&#39;re lecturing which is effectively a</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.040" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">monologue there&#39;s a sense of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.300" end="00:36:00.380" style="s2">something very alive about the way they</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:02.420" style="s2">they do that it&#39;s not telling a story</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.380" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">there is almost a kind of inquiry there</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.420" end="00:36:06.590" style="s2">they know where the pieces are they know</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:09.050" style="s2">what the landscape is but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.590" end="00:36:11.900" style="s2">exploring it in real time yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.050" end="00:36:15.590" style="s2">that almost more than anything else is</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.900" end="00:36:19.550" style="s2">what has attracted a lot of people to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.590" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">their thought is that sense of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.550" end="00:36:26.050" style="s2">such a different quality to a to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s being genuinely</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:34.820" style="s2">aliveness to it to compare to la</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.120" end="00:36:37.790" style="s2">academia is largely dead it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.820" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">people recycling dead ideas or dead</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.790" end="00:36:41.720" style="s2">concepts and there&#39;s there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">emergent about it but there is something</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">very emergent about John and and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">Jordan I wonder if if it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:53.180" style="s2">same with Jordan because he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:55.010" style="s2">touring the same material for so long</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.180" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">sort of over a year doing 12 rules for</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.010" end="00:36:59.660" style="s2">life but with John there&#39;s this real</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.320" end="00:37:04.610" style="s2">sense of and he&#39;s such an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.660" end="00:37:06.500" style="s2">thinker as well you watch him he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.610" end="00:37:10.310" style="s2">constantly just sticky lating there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.500" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">this sort of neat what comes to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.310" end="00:37:16.220" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s phrase I think with a hammer</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:21.830" style="s2">yes like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.220" end="00:37:23.810" style="s2">embodied knowledge and that the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.830" end="00:37:29.570" style="s2">that I think really but comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.810" end="00:37:31.490" style="s2">this same sense of inter subjective yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.570" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">into subjective dialogue of just being</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.490" end="00:37:35.060" style="s2">being trying to be on that sort of edge</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">of what wants to emerge and being</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.060" end="00:37:41.000" style="s2">surprised by it yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">that&#39;s I think I think I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.000" end="00:37:45.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:47.880" style="s2">I think when people talk about what they</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.540" end="00:37:52.349" style="s2">like about Jordan Peterson right for</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.880" end="00:37:54.150" style="s2">example I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that what</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.349" end="00:37:56.760" style="s2">they saved the content that they say I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.150" end="00:38:00.900" style="s2">think one of the things that they like</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.760" end="00:38:06.390" style="s2">the experience of here of listening to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.900" end="00:38:09.270" style="s2">him because both John and and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.390" end="00:38:11.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right they have this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.270" end="00:38:14.309" style="s2">that to understand what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.720" end="00:38:16.920" style="s2">you must actually think the thought that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.309" end="00:38:19.349" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking and and because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.920" end="00:38:22.829" style="s2">right at the at onna just at the her</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.349" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">they&#39;re just always like trying to speak</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.829" end="00:38:27.299" style="s2">what&#39;s just beyond the horizon right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">you almost have to allow yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.299" end="00:38:34.559" style="s2">changed by it yes yes yes yes you open</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">up and you have to there&#39;s it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.559" end="00:38:39.180" style="s2">your ear and and what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">about listening is what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.180" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">I can&#39;t think and listen at the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:46.710" style="s2">time right I can feel and listen at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:49.260" style="s2">same time right I can kind of look and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.710" end="00:38:51.000" style="s2">listen at the same time but I but if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.260" end="00:38:55.140" style="s2">think while I&#39;m trying to listen</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.000" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">I can&#39;t there is a very wedded leg</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.140" end="00:39:00.420" style="s2">relationship between listening and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:03.569" style="s2">thinking so to really to listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.420" end="00:39:05.069" style="s2">is to actually think the thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.569" end="00:39:07.980" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking in the moment right</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.069" end="00:39:11.339" style="s2">which are are still being worked out</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.980" end="00:39:12.990" style="s2">right so people when they listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.339" end="00:39:14.339" style="s2">they don&#39;t it&#39;s not like they just got a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.990" end="00:39:17.430" style="s2">bunch of information if they went</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.339" end="00:39:19.500" style="s2">through an experience and I really love</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.430" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">this about what you guys are doing and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.500" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">one of the things I like about one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.930" style="s2">the rare places where technology just</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:31.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lead to more optimization it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">actually creates a place such that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.020" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">can have a very untechnical experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:42.180" style="s2">called deep meandering difficult</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:44.819" style="s2">conversations to grapple with them and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.180" end="00:39:46.319" style="s2">I like they were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.819" end="00:39:48.109" style="s2">because this is a real I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.319" end="00:39:50.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of language that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.109" end="00:39:53.309" style="s2">articulates this particular thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.190" end="00:39:55.319" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about but it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.309" end="00:39:57.300" style="s2">very very transformative in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.319" end="00:39:59.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s like a few different</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.300" end="00:40:00.840" style="s2">levels like on one level they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.160" end="00:40:02.130" style="s2">they&#39;re teaching you the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.840" end="00:40:06.390" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.130" end="00:40:09.030" style="s2">teaching you how to think how by</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.390" end="00:40:11.460" style="s2">understanding what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.030" end="00:40:13.080" style="s2">you start to actually have to step on</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.460" end="00:40:15.390" style="s2">the presuppositions that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.080" end="00:40:17.400" style="s2">stepping on to then think the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.390" end="00:40:20.130" style="s2">that they&#39;re thinking and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.400" end="00:40:21.510" style="s2">that&#39;s why we want to go there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.130" end="00:40:23.340" style="s2">videos you want to go back and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.510" end="00:40:26.120" style="s2">over and over and over again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.340" end="00:40:29.010" style="s2">because you you have this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.120" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a thought here that I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.010" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">the correct presuppositions to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:36.630" style="s2">to think all the way right so like I I</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:40.850" style="s2">rehearse it I rehearse it I rehearse it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.630" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">at some point I get the background right</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.850" end="00:40:47.400" style="s2">that is required so like give the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:49.110" style="s2">foreground thought I&#39;m feeling as well a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.400" end="00:40:51.030" style="s2">link back to what we were discussing</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.110" end="00:40:54.650" style="s2">before which is naming what&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.030" end="00:40:57.360" style="s2">field because I mean Jordan says this</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.650" end="00:40:59.400" style="s2">that a lot of people come up to him and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.360" end="00:41:03.720" style="s2">say you&#39;re saying what I already knew</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.400" end="00:41:07.980" style="s2">right right I think John is doing a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.720" end="00:41:11.430" style="s2">similar grand narrative and if a grand</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.980" end="00:41:14.610" style="s2">narrative is true and Jordan also really</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.430" end="00:41:16.410" style="s2">links this to evolutionary history and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.610" end="00:41:18.140" style="s2">the fact that these stories are so old</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.410" end="00:41:21.690" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually encoded into us</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.140" end="00:41:23.370" style="s2">there is a sense of their doing what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.690" end="00:41:25.710" style="s2">process I described before that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.370" end="00:41:27.750" style="s2">actually sort of speaking making</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:30.360" style="s2">conscious what was implicit and making</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.750" end="00:41:32.730" style="s2">conscious what was there in the field is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.360" end="00:41:34.950" style="s2">basically what they&#39;re doing in a much</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.730" end="00:41:39.450" style="s2">more in almost this sort of vast</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.950" end="00:41:42.360" style="s2">cultural level yeah yeah it&#39;s genuine</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.450" end="00:41:43.590" style="s2">philosophy I would say so giving a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.360" end="00:41:47.700" style="s2">Nietzsche talked about he&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.590" end="00:41:49.490" style="s2">philosopher the philosopher doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.700" end="00:41:52.230" style="s2">an original thought out of nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.490" end="00:41:55.470" style="s2">they&#39;re just the first ones to bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.230" end="00:41:58.320" style="s2">into articulated thoughts what has been</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.470" end="00:42:00.900" style="s2">emerging in the culture as they bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.320" end="00:42:04.760" style="s2">into language right and indeed should</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.900" end="00:42:07.140" style="s2">did this profoundly right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.760" end="00:42:09.030" style="s2">which makes it an art in some ways I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.140" end="00:42:10.870" style="s2">mean that is that&#39;s the essence of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.030" end="00:42:12.540" style="s2">artist isn&#39;t it to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.870" end="00:42:13.840" style="s2">since what is coming before it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.540" end="00:42:17.230" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.840" end="00:42:19.090" style="s2">right like it&#39;s really is that I just</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.230" end="00:42:20.710" style="s2">something about I really like the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.090" end="00:42:23.050" style="s2">that you guys are talking about sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.710" end="00:42:25.480" style="s2">making as a thing that I&#39;m hearing other</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.050" end="00:42:27.400" style="s2">people use because something about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.480" end="00:42:31.150" style="s2">word that gathers the appropriate term</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.400" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">for the the transformational activity</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.150" end="00:42:37.390" style="s2">where knowing we&#39;re knowing one knows</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:40.210" style="s2">through being transformed by what one</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.390" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">knows right that activity and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.210" end="00:42:44.530" style="s2">one way could happen is like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">talking about with John and Jordan other</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.530" end="00:42:50.110" style="s2">people man when they&#39;re grap when</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.140" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">they&#39;re being existentially confronted</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.110" end="00:42:57.550" style="s2">right you end up being confronted with</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:59.080" style="s2">them if you really listen right the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.550" end="00:43:04.600" style="s2">other thing I appreciated it by talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.080" end="00:43:07.420" style="s2">with John and then the interview was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.600" end="00:43:11.260" style="s2">this connection that we that emerged in</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.420" end="00:43:11.800" style="s2">the conversation of Christopher for</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.260" end="00:43:13.600" style="s2">Bakey</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.800" end="00:43:16.120" style="s2">he talked about being socially phobic</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.600" end="00:43:18.040" style="s2">right so a man that&#39;s where it&#39;s like on</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.120" end="00:43:19.690" style="s2">on some level Jordan Peter so don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.040" end="00:43:21.310" style="s2">the sense is he&#39;s socially phobic right</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.690" end="00:43:24.460" style="s2">he&#39;s like loves people and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.310" end="00:43:25.600" style="s2">John&#39;s a little bit more like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.460" end="00:43:26.140" style="s2">a little bit more introverted or</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.600" end="00:43:28.780" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.140" end="00:43:31.780" style="s2">so there&#39;s another level of Terror for</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.780" end="00:43:34.600" style="s2">him to be to have people know more about</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.600" end="00:43:39.700" style="s2">a very can feel very exposing but what</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.050" end="00:43:43.030" style="s2">he said was really interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.700" end="00:43:44.920" style="s2">it&#39;s all the people leave but he&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.550" end="00:44:04.270" style="s2">insights that we had together as we were</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.530" end="00:44:06.100" style="s2">talking was on some level but all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.270" end="00:44:08.710" style="s2">people he&#39;s talked to he probably they</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.100" end="00:44:10.690" style="s2">have very different like they they veer</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.710" end="00:44:17.640" style="s2">from each other&#39;s views more than</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.690" end="00:44:20.710" style="s2">anybody but in some ways because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.640" end="00:44:23.020" style="s2">demonstration of risk that Paul is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.710" end="00:44:30.760" style="s2">demonstrating in doing what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.020" end="00:44:34.150" style="s2">right has allowed allowed John the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.760" end="00:44:36.490" style="s2">courage to transcend his own phobia</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.150" end="00:44:38.890" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that link between</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.490" end="00:44:40.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not that link where that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.890" end="00:44:43.090" style="s2">where it gets very heroic in that way</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.510" end="00:44:45.820" style="s2">right and that other people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.090" end="00:44:48.250" style="s2">demonstrating coming forward and being</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.820" end="00:44:50.470" style="s2">vulnerable proactively right in the face</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.250" end="00:44:53.050" style="s2">of of the risk and and it draws other</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.470" end="00:44:56.590" style="s2">people even socially phobic people out</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.050" end="00:45:00.790" style="s2">of the woodwork that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.590" end="00:45:02.860" style="s2">vulnerability I think is maybe one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.790" end="00:45:05.110" style="s2">the antidotes to some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.860" end="00:45:08.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve been confronting in your channel</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.110" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">like some of the bullet polarization and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.130" end="00:45:13.120" style="s2">culture wars there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:15.850" style="s2">that that like I think we can see live</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.120" end="00:45:18.040" style="s2">as you&#39;re making self aware</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.850" end="00:45:19.780" style="s2">of that emergent is that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.040" end="00:45:21.180" style="s2">you could say in one level you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.780" end="00:45:24.010" style="s2">interviewing people that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.180" end="00:45:27.070" style="s2">demonstrating like proactive vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.010" end="00:45:30.730" style="s2">courage in a way that&#39;s making them</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.070" end="00:45:35.740" style="s2">stronger yeah and I think there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.730" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">hunger for that people to to see people</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.740" end="00:45:46.260" style="s2">doing that yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:48.940" style="s2">in fact I the video that you sent me hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.260" end="00:45:54.070" style="s2">that is this the three-way conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.940" end="00:45:55.480" style="s2">between yeah I was interested to raise</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.070" end="00:45:58.420" style="s2">that so this is a three-way conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.480" end="00:46:00.790" style="s2">between Jamie wheel Jordan greenhalgh</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.420" end="00:46:02.440" style="s2">and Daniel SHM actin burger which we</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.790" end="00:46:06.730" style="s2">will probably be making live on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:09.520" style="s2">channel fairly soon but I but I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.730" end="00:46:11.350" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most it&#39;s about emergent</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.520" end="00:46:13.030" style="s2">sense making it&#39;s kind of that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.350" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">topic of it just framing it for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.030" end="00:46:22.200" style="s2">watching win8 when they say about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:25.930" style="s2">video way hmm I just curious that mmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.200" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">like I just felt a-- hmm well it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.930" end="00:46:29.740" style="s2">interesting because I already had in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:33.460" style="s2">mind that I wanted to that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.740" end="00:46:37.090" style="s2">be sort of my next question was to to</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.090" end="00:46:44.440" style="s2">just did that that when somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.860" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">mmm-hmm I just noticed ep</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.440" end="00:46:48.820" style="s2">I always joke it&#39;s like if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.440" style="s2">know how to circle just like going to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.820" end="00:46:52.120" style="s2">room somebody says something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.440" end="00:46:53.770" style="s2">somebody goes hmm go could you put that</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.120" end="00:46:56.830" style="s2">in another way and as they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.770" end="00:46:58.600" style="s2">somebody else says hmm another way and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.830" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">eventually if you keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.600" end="00:47:05.500" style="s2">eventually you&#39;ll hit god right that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:08.050" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that mmm that I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.500" end="00:47:09.790" style="s2">think is very I&#39;m just curious what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.050" end="00:47:13.150" style="s2">think about this is like feels like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.790" end="00:47:15.370" style="s2">that&#39;s that speaks to a sensibility mmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.150" end="00:47:19.000" style="s2">when somebody says that it registers it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.370" end="00:47:22.560" style="s2">at both a change and a knowingness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.000" end="00:47:22.560" style="s2">something got unconcealed</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">hmm I think I probably do that quite a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.829" end="00:47:36.329" style="s2">lot it might be a little bit of a verbal</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">tick of mine in fact I know I do because</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.329" end="00:47:42.150" style="s2">I have to keep editing out thumbs at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:44.430" style="s2">end of the well I&#39;m doing my my editing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.150" end="00:47:46.200" style="s2">I pretty much do at the end of every</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.430" end="00:47:48.420" style="s2">time the person&#39;s so I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.200" end="00:47:49.829" style="s2">something that&#39;s but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.420" end="00:47:52.260" style="s2">unique to me but it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.829" end="00:47:54.359" style="s2">something I do quite a lot yes so</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.260" end="00:47:57.420" style="s2">there&#39;s like the space filler mmm great</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.359" end="00:47:59.400" style="s2">but then there&#39;s like hmm and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.420" end="00:48:03.210" style="s2">one of the things that registers is how</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.400" end="00:48:05.310" style="s2">the ideal or the idea are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.210" end="00:48:08.339" style="s2">connected to our bodies and sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.310" end="00:48:10.380" style="s2">and so when somebody&#39;s impacted I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.339" end="00:48:13.859" style="s2">just always noticed like encircling it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.380" end="00:48:15.630" style="s2">like how I know where to bring my</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.859" end="00:48:18.660" style="s2">attention is when some of mmm I was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.630" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">Oh something just emerged and then they</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.660" end="00:48:22.050" style="s2">have they come to language with</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:26.329" style="s2">something but they actually have to look</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.050" end="00:48:29.550" style="s2">to describe it it&#39;s both intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.329" end="00:48:31.800" style="s2">ideological right and sensory at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.550" end="00:48:32.190" style="s2">same time I&#39;m just really fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.800" end="00:48:37.109" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.190" end="00:48:40.170" style="s2">now who&#39;s mm-hmm the thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.109" end="00:48:46.440" style="s2">conversation which I just thought was so</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.170" end="00:48:49.319" style="s2">good it was so good and on so many</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.440" end="00:48:51.450" style="s2">different levels right there&#39;s the level</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.319" end="00:48:56.730" style="s2">of like the ideas that they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.450" end="00:48:59.220" style="s2">right and how those those ideas got more</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.730" end="00:49:01.890" style="s2">distinguished and developed as it went</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.220" end="00:49:03.780" style="s2">on right so there&#39;s there&#39;s tons we</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.890" end="00:49:08.310" style="s2">could we could talk about and in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.780" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">of that however there is the the part</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.310" end="00:49:14.510" style="s2">that was like one of the highlights for</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">me was when green hall</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.510" end="00:49:20.510" style="s2">called out the topography of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:22.190" style="s2">conversation remember that part yes and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.510" end="00:49:25.550" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.190" end="00:49:27.860" style="s2">like that was but like that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.550" end="00:49:29.840" style="s2">bugging me for about twenty minutes as I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.860" end="00:49:32.570" style="s2">was sitting there I was like they were</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:53.240" style="s2">topography move in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:54.710" style="s2">right because he kind of was presenting</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.240" end="00:49:57.260" style="s2">a lot of the stuff he was basically</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.710" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">saying like presenting stuff about yeah</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.500" end="00:51:09.950" style="s2">but there&#39;s his way in where he called</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.850" end="00:51:12.230" style="s2">out the typography but then he went to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.950" end="00:51:16.010" style="s2">this other move right and he was like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.230" end="00:51:17.180" style="s2">think rather than focusing on it back on</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.010" end="00:51:19.820" style="s2">Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.180" end="00:51:22.730" style="s2">he focused in what&#39;s the nemi the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.820" end="00:51:24.500" style="s2">guy the other trial Daniel Daniel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.730" end="00:51:27.160" style="s2">like actually I haven&#39;t heard anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.500" end="00:51:30.700" style="s2">from you in</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.160" end="00:51:32.620" style="s2">he just just awareness of that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.700" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">having an experience together and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.620" end="00:51:40.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that it&#39;s going um it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:43.270" style="s2">disrupted things right but in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">that actually for me the main takeaway I</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.270" end="00:51:52.200" style="s2">got from that like for me in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:52.200" style="s2">content was this thing about urgency</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.320" end="00:51:56.170" style="s2">what-what-what Greenhalgh said because</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.190" end="00:52:00.730" style="s2">it exists like this the sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.170" end="00:52:06.340" style="s2">in what Greenhalgh said was yeah real or</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.730" end="00:52:09.790" style="s2">imagined urgency right is not to respond</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.340" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">it to it as in an urgent way right is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.790" end="00:52:16.870" style="s2">not sacrifice the way we are with what</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:18.790" style="s2">we were being with the way of being even</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.870" end="00:52:21.580" style="s2">when it&#39;s a real urgency and he used the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.790" end="00:52:23.980" style="s2">analogy John Bob you know James Bond</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.580" end="00:52:25.510" style="s2">right being like you know the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.980" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">gonna fall apart and James is just kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.510" end="00:52:30.040" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:32.170" style="s2">like as if he&#39;s stirring his martini and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.040" end="00:52:35.100" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s while about that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.170" end="00:52:37.840" style="s2">that I I started to notice that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.100" end="00:52:39.820" style="s2">typography started to happen when the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.840" end="00:52:43.300" style="s2">sense of urgency was kept being brought</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.820" end="00:52:46.300" style="s2">up right is when James is like well what</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.300" end="00:52:49.000" style="s2">about that and like he kept presupposing</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.300" end="00:52:50.380" style="s2">the reality on the ground and like well</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.000" end="00:52:53.770" style="s2">how are we gonna do this and he asked</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.380" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">the how question and that&#39;s when that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.770" end="00:52:58.870" style="s2">typography was was like started and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:01.870" style="s2">it was named and when they named it</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.870" end="00:53:03.910" style="s2">right and for me anyways the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.870" end="00:53:06.790" style="s2">that conversation was like oh yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.910" end="00:53:12.730" style="s2">see all these places in my life where it</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.790" end="00:53:17.080" style="s2">looks urgent and I I almost get get</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.730" end="00:53:20.020" style="s2">dopamine out of sacrificing a way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.080" end="00:53:21.580" style="s2">being in responding to the urgency and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.020" end="00:53:23.890" style="s2">just is one of those ones it was an</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.580" end="00:53:26.440" style="s2">insight that I could just frame all all</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.890" end="00:53:29.110" style="s2">for my history and my whole life and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.440" end="00:53:32.770" style="s2">that that was part of naming what was</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.110" end="00:53:34.060" style="s2">happening in like in the fields in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.770" end="00:53:38.470" style="s2">inner subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.060" end="00:53:40.490" style="s2">so that was my clumsy way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.470" end="00:53:43.610" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.490" end="00:53:45.290" style="s2">Circle circumambulate around all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.610" end="00:53:47.270" style="s2">different multiple levels in which that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.290" end="00:53:48.860" style="s2">conversation was deeply intelligent for</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.270" end="00:53:53.270" style="s2">me hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.860" end="00:53:55.670" style="s2">yeah I I think there were I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.270" end="00:53:59.120" style="s2">right I mean that that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.670" end="00:54:04.430" style="s2">that was a moment where it became more</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.120" end="00:54:06.530" style="s2">self-aware in in observing with in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.430" end="00:54:08.420" style="s2">observing what was going on while it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.530" end="00:54:10.910" style="s2">going on which then encouraged a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.420" end="00:54:16.250" style="s2">level of presence and everyone there</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.910" end="00:54:18.080" style="s2">yeah and yeah and I thought the just</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.250" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">there were so many gems in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.080" end="00:54:25.280" style="s2">conversation so many different analogies</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:29.320" style="s2">I love the Quaker example of don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:31.990" style="s2">until spoken through was fantastic I</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:36.080" style="s2">love the analogies with jazz as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.990" end="00:54:38.530" style="s2">just the sense of being alive to what</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.080" end="00:54:41.360" style="s2">wants to emerge and then we have and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.530" end="00:54:42.980" style="s2">jazz I think John also mentioned jazz in</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.360" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">your conversation with him because there</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.980" end="00:54:48.230" style="s2">is or let&#39;s not link it to jazz let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:50.360" style="s2">talk about any any band right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.230" end="00:54:53.420" style="s2">aware in any band it&#39;s like when someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.360" end="00:54:55.940" style="s2">wants to go on a solo or when when</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.420" end="00:54:57.770" style="s2">someone&#39;s kind of cutting someone else</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.940" end="00:55:00.770" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you&#39;re biting my jam or</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.770" end="00:55:03.770" style="s2">whatever it we have a terminology for it</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.770" end="00:55:07.070" style="s2">and we all know or certainly the members</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.770" end="00:55:09.290" style="s2">of a band know when someone is playing</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.070" end="00:55:13.220" style="s2">from that place of real alignment and</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.290" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">when they&#39;re kind of spoiling someone</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.220" end="00:55:16.760" style="s2">else&#39;s or their or their their</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:19.430" style="s2">overwriting someone else&#39;s contribution</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.760" end="00:55:22.130" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a whole implicit</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.430" end="00:55:24.410" style="s2">knowledge that that we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.130" end="00:55:27.740" style="s2">as much in conversation or in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.410" end="00:55:28.850" style="s2">yes there is a way as you&#39;re talking I</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.740" end="00:55:30.620" style="s2">really appreciate the way that you just</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.850" end="00:55:34.970" style="s2">kind of brought that back into like oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.620" end="00:55:38.780" style="s2">yeah jazz and and no not just jazz all</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.970" end="00:55:40.670" style="s2">music and that we know there is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.780" end="00:55:42.260" style="s2">that we know when somebody&#39;s riffing in</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.670" end="00:55:45.470" style="s2">a way that&#39;s really gorgeous and when</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.260" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">somebody&#39;s riffing out of I even think</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.470" end="00:55:48.560" style="s2">in the conversation he talked about like</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.170" style="s2">some sense of narcissism or needing to</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.560" end="00:55:54.740" style="s2">be seen or something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.170" end="00:55:58.370" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s one really enjoyed the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.740" end="00:56:00.740" style="s2">the way that Green Hall named it right</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.370" end="00:56:02.710" style="s2">is that I got this sense of I even felt</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.740" end="00:56:05.390" style="s2">this as he was saying it I felt this</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.710" end="00:56:08.980" style="s2">like a little tension like something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.390" end="00:56:11.470" style="s2">about to happen in the way the what</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.980" end="00:56:14.380" style="s2">what he pointed to wasn&#39;t hurt like to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.470" end="00:56:17.560" style="s2">anybody personal because he could have</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.380" end="00:56:20.590" style="s2">gone through out of well like what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.560" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">Jamie&#39;s psychology right what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.590" end="00:56:28.570" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there like but he went</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:31.540" style="s2">to there there&#39;s something were inside</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.570" end="00:56:34.600" style="s2">of there&#39;s this that&#39;s happening as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.540" end="00:56:40.920" style="s2">dynamic and looking at it as a Systems</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.600" end="00:56:40.920" style="s2">sense of it right where it didn&#39;t it it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.940" end="00:56:45.160" style="s2">it felt like it it allowed</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.779" end="00:56:54.789" style="s2">the personality basically right and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.929" end="00:56:56.439" style="s2">and yet invited everybody to to see</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.789" end="00:56:58.569" style="s2">themselves in the dynamic that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.439" end="00:57:01.539" style="s2">happening but his spoke to something</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.569" end="00:57:04.449" style="s2">that was transcendent and influencing</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.539" end="00:57:06.519" style="s2">the the we if you will which led to</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.449" end="00:57:08.619" style="s2">something in my in my view that then it</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.519" end="00:57:11.049" style="s2">started to articulate they all started</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.619" end="00:57:14.439" style="s2">to relax a lot more and it started to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.049" end="00:57:15.609" style="s2">get more jazzy right at the end of it it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.439" end="00:57:18.579" style="s2">was just I really think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.609" end="00:57:21.819" style="s2">beautiful conversation and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.579" end="00:57:23.679" style="s2">there&#39;s one of the one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.819" end="00:57:28.239" style="s2">that I was how I was listening to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.679" end="00:57:30.869" style="s2">because when my deep interest is with</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.239" end="00:57:30.869" style="s2">circling</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:40.539" style="s2">is beyond just people&#39;s personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.140" end="00:57:43.239" style="s2">that how is it that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.539" end="00:57:46.959" style="s2">dialogues and conversations even when</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.239" end="00:57:50.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not about something personal right</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.959" end="00:57:54.039" style="s2">that like how can that ideas be</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.289" end="00:57:59.769" style="s2">expressed right and such that that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.039" end="00:58:01.690" style="s2">can have this autopoietic self of world</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.769" end="00:58:04.749" style="s2">work oh fitting each other and opening</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.690" end="00:58:07.089" style="s2">and being vulnerable not having to even</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.749" end="00:58:10.029" style="s2">talk about ourselves at all but be able</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.089" end="00:58:13.660" style="s2">to talk about ideas right and just walk</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.029" end="00:58:16.089" style="s2">away more ourselves and enrich then we</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.660" end="00:58:18.359" style="s2">walked in so I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.089" end="00:58:21.069" style="s2">different levels of intelligibility that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.359" end="00:58:23.640" style="s2">we could we could draw out of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.069" end="00:58:26.079" style="s2">conversation so I really appreciate thee</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.640" end="00:58:28.959" style="s2">that you were inclined to do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.079" end="00:58:31.569" style="s2">mmm yeah when I knew that the three of</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.959" end="00:58:32.979" style="s2">them were gonna be in the same place I</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.569" end="00:58:35.319" style="s2">kind of knew that it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.979" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">something that we had to to get on</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.319" end="00:58:42.969" style="s2">camera I wanted to just make one last</p>

<p begin="01:01:43.930" end="01:01:47.590" style="s2">I&#39;m one I think if I look at the gravity</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:50.020" style="s2">that I felt and that like and as I sit</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.590" end="01:01:54.220" style="s2">with like the kind of gravity I get from</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.020" end="01:01:56.560" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s because there is a way in</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.220" end="01:01:58.900" style="s2">which I feel yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.560" end="01:02:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s there there&#39;s something beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.900" end="01:02:08.020" style="s2">about the way that we&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.800" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">this and sensing it and that maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.020" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">just wondering maybe that sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.140" end="01:02:20.500" style="s2">sense of beauty that shines forth from</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.860" end="01:02:23.830" style="s2">the inquiry in the way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.500" end="01:02:25.780" style="s2">talking about it I wonder if that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.830" end="01:02:31.290" style="s2">indication of that well maybe were at</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.780" end="01:02:35.770" style="s2">the right spot hmm I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.290" end="01:02:38.320" style="s2">well yeah I I did I had a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.770" end="01:02:39.970" style="s2">direction too that I wouldn&#39;t yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.320" end="01:02:41.380" style="s2">don&#39;t like that I don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.970" end="01:02:46.330" style="s2">analogy of the right spot because I</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.380" end="01:02:49.180" style="s2">think there&#39;s a sense of there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.330" end="01:02:50.770" style="s2">of movement I mean the aesthetic that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.180" end="01:02:52.530" style="s2">that felt right at the moment I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.770" end="01:02:56.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s true but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.530" end="01:03:01.450" style="s2">something that I think a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.500" end="01:03:03.190" style="s2">people are picking up from that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.450" end="01:03:05.500" style="s2">people who are who are following what</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.190" end="01:03:07.780" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and immediately recognize</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.500" end="01:03:11.470" style="s2">that no like yes I can see what you guys</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.780" end="01:03:13.930" style="s2">are doing even though we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.470" end="01:03:15.700" style="s2">name it there&#39;s a sense of I can see</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.930" end="01:03:18.580" style="s2">where you guys are going I can see where</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.700" end="01:03:21.250" style="s2">you&#39;re yeah and there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.580" end="01:03:22.630" style="s2">evolution as a sense of a teleology but</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.250" end="01:03:28.840" style="s2">I think a lot of people are picking up</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.630" end="01:03:30.280" style="s2">to this conversation so and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.840" end="01:03:32.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a Reckitt there&#39;s a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.280" end="01:03:35.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep recognition and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.350" end="01:03:38.830" style="s2">that is an aesthetic sense oh I see I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.350" end="01:03:41.230" style="s2">mean none of us know where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.830" end="01:03:43.210" style="s2">destination is or what the that we know</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.230" end="01:03:47.860" style="s2">those are there there but we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.210" end="01:03:49.750" style="s2">what where there is yet and as soon as</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.860" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">we start thinking we do know where that</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.750" end="01:03:55.740" style="s2">there is then we&#39;re no longer that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:57.310" style="s2">when the journey ends in some way right</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.740" end="01:04:01.420" style="s2">because we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.310" end="01:04:03.550" style="s2">to keep alive - - and make that making</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.420" end="01:04:07.900" style="s2">sense prematurely of okay it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.550" end="01:04:09.460" style="s2">thing is the trap and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.900" end="01:04:10.990" style="s2">people have actually I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.460" end="01:04:13.120" style="s2">name names but I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.990" end="01:04:14.740" style="s2">who&#39;ve been on this emerging current</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.120" end="01:04:17.110" style="s2">have crystallized around a certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.740" end="01:04:19.210" style="s2">perspective and then once you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.110" end="01:04:23.260" style="s2">crystallized around that you&#39;re then</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.210" end="01:04:26.650" style="s2">dragged down into a sort of into a more</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.260" end="01:04:28.210" style="s2">sort of polarized fixated position that</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.650" end="01:04:33.460" style="s2">you&#39;re then having to defend rather than</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.210" end="01:04:36.070" style="s2">stay open right right so there&#39;s a so</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.460" end="01:04:37.720" style="s2">Dalek I experience beauty as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.070" end="01:04:39.700" style="s2">talking like in a way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.720" end="01:04:42.070" style="s2">bringing that together I think it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.700" end="01:04:43.840" style="s2">you said something about yet spot the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.070" end="01:04:45.940" style="s2">Rick were right at the right spot isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.840" end="01:04:47.380" style="s2">quite the right word what I heard you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.940" end="01:04:49.630" style="s2">say is yes because I think that has to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.380" end="01:04:51.250" style="s2">be a sense of movement yes like I feel a</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.630" end="01:04:54.820" style="s2">sense of movement rather than in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.250" end="01:04:58.120" style="s2">right spot it&#39;s like where there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.820" end="01:05:01.900" style="s2">analogy yeah it&#39;s like surf surfing a</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.120" end="01:05:03.550" style="s2">wave I guess or I think Jamie has used</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.900" end="01:05:04.660" style="s2">an analogy that that works I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.550" end="01:05:08.530" style="s2">really remember what it is at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.660" end="01:05:11.550" style="s2">but it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not fixated in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.530" end="01:05:13.870" style="s2">position and it&#39;s it is like an ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.550" end="01:05:16.120" style="s2">temporality in a sentiment in the Haida</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.870" end="01:05:22.420" style="s2">bearing sense of the word I think that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.120" end="01:05:24.070" style="s2">awareness of so I made a video one time</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.420" end="01:05:25.930" style="s2">just to try to get this notion of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.070" end="01:05:29.770" style="s2">horizon I think it&#39;s a horizon that</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.930" end="01:05:32.560" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about right of that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.770" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">ground right there&#39;s chaos on the ground</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.940" end="01:06:30.220" style="s2">genuine sense of revealing where where</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.340" end="01:06:34.090" style="s2">it&#39;s you could both veil both means to</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.220" end="01:06:36.430" style="s2">Reeve ale and to unveil at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.090" end="01:06:38.710" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sensibility that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.430" end="01:06:44.050" style="s2">the same word and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.710" end="01:06:49.620" style="s2">about that what it seems to take to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.050" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">with what&#39;s emerging is a sense of one</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.620" end="01:06:56.860" style="s2">recognizing a preciousness that&#39;s worthy</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:58.750" style="s2">of mailing right and that and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.860" end="01:07:01.120" style="s2">there&#39;s ways that you can reveal but</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.750" end="01:07:03.580" style="s2">conceal at the same time and thus you</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.120" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">can&#39;t name it and make it a noun and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.580" end="01:07:07.330" style="s2">then become identified with it and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:09.130" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing is you&#39;re just really</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.330" end="01:07:11.770" style="s2">self-aware it&#39;s part of the self</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.130" end="01:07:14.740" style="s2">awareness of it if I&#39;m hearing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.770" end="01:07:17.590" style="s2">right is yeah it&#39;s really important that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.740" end="01:07:20.860" style="s2">we that that we not we be aware that</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.590" end="01:07:23.470" style="s2">it&#39;s unnameable in some way because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.860" end="01:07:25.030" style="s2">the moment we name it I put a shell</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.470" end="01:07:27.790" style="s2">around myself as the moment I become</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.030" end="01:07:30.820" style="s2">Friddle mmm so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.790" end="01:07:33.820" style="s2">this strength vulnerability opening to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.820" end="01:07:38.830" style="s2">novelty in such a way that deepens my</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.820" end="01:07:42.970" style="s2">sense of security yeah it rises out of</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.830" end="01:07:45.640" style="s2">my grappling with or with Heidegger hmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.970" end="01:07:50.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.640" end="01:07:52.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like a phenomenology per munetaka</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.260" end="01:07:57.460" style="s2">phenomenology hermetic existential</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.920" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">phenomenology basically who was it</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.460" end="01:08:01.870" style="s2">Heidegger who talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:04.750" style="s2">thoroughness yep yeah yeah I was really</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.870" end="01:08:07.210" style="s2">struck by that yeah Heidegger is one of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.750" end="01:08:12.849" style="s2">those ones are just like</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.210" end="01:08:14.589" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even know how by grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.849" end="01:08:16.569" style="s2">Heidegger for the first three years that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.589" end="01:08:19.799" style="s2">we started circling I had no idea what</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.569" end="01:08:24.460" style="s2">the connections was until I kind of uh I</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.799" end="01:08:26.589" style="s2">started realizing it after the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.460" end="01:08:28.299" style="s2">how it transformed how I was seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.589" end="01:08:30.429" style="s2">world because that&#39;s the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.299" end="01:08:36.219" style="s2">Heidegger and phenomenology is you would</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.429" end="01:08:38.589" style="s2">say that uh that that the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.219" end="01:08:40.839" style="s2">mystery isn&#39;t so much beyond the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.589" end="01:08:44.620" style="s2">is that which is most near it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.839" end="01:08:46.630" style="s2">concealed nearness so lots of so that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.620" end="01:08:48.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I think what I realized</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.630" end="01:08:51.130" style="s2">is circling is so much about is like</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.370" end="01:08:54.069" style="s2">what&#39;s here like what&#39;s already always</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.130" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">having found myself already begun it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.069" end="01:08:58.540" style="s2">inside of it there&#39;s reading Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:01.239" style="s2">over and over and over again of him</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.540" end="01:09:02.350" style="s2">doing that not understanding what the</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.239" end="01:09:04.150" style="s2"> he was talking about all of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.350" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">sudden I was like I look around and I</p>
