<p begin="00:00:54.170" end="00:00:58.610" style="s2">circling and is wrong in its foundation</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.600" end="00:01:00.140" style="s2">to some extent in this podcast the bulk</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.610" end="00:01:02.629" style="s2">of the discussion actually centers</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.140" end="00:01:04.940" style="s2">around the German philosopher Martin</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.629" end="00:01:07.550" style="s2">Heidegger who was active in the early</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.940" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">and mid 20th century and transformed</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.550" end="00:01:12.649" style="s2">Western philosophy completely hider is</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.640" end="00:01:15.050" style="s2">known for influencing modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.649" end="00:01:16.490" style="s2">post-modernism but his own philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.050" end="00:01:18.890" style="s2">starkly different from those</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.490" end="00:01:21.410" style="s2">intellectual movements this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.890" end="00:01:23.690" style="s2">wasn&#39;t aimed to become too technical and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.410" end="00:01:25.520" style="s2">I deliberately tried to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.690" end="00:01:27.649" style="s2">conversation general enough for an</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.520" end="00:01:30.380" style="s2">introduction into his ideas and his</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.649" end="00:01:33.020" style="s2">ontology so there&#39;s no requirement on</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.380" end="00:01:35.240" style="s2">the listeners part feel familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.020" end="00:01:36.979" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s work per se God was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.240" end="00:01:38.990" style="s2">fascinating speaker and I got a lot out</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.979" end="00:01:40.970" style="s2">of our discussion which could have gone</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.990" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">on much longer and often became</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.970" end="00:01:46.220" style="s2">extremely challenging to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:48.289" style="s2">but this is common when discussing any</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.220" end="00:01:50.209" style="s2">of heidegger&#39;s ideas I hope you enjoy</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">and topics but I just wanted to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.860" end="00:02:39.000" style="s2">start by getting a bit of background</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.680" style="s2">from you and and where your interests</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.000" end="00:02:43.710" style="s2">are it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.680" end="00:02:46.740" style="s2">my my my journey with Heidegger has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.710" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s so compelling to me how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.740" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">got into Heidegger and like the impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:54.210" style="s2">I&#39;m continually finding the impact that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">he&#39;s had on me as a person in its way</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.210" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">that&#39;s this way that I keep finding out</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:02:59.490" style="s2">about which is just I think so telling</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">who he is</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.490" end="00:03:06.870" style="s2">as a thinker the thing I&#39;m most known</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.490" style="s2">for is founding being one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.870" end="00:03:12.030" style="s2">founders of something called circling</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.490" end="00:03:15.600" style="s2">yeah which is something that a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.030" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">mine and I came across spontaneously in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.600" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">the way that we were relating to each</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:22.709" style="s2">other at Burning Man in 1998</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:27.690" style="s2">do you want to quickly just explain what</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.709" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">Burning Man is I know I&#39;ll do my best</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.690" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">the Burning Man Burning Man you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:34.620" style="s2">say is like it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:38.340" style="s2">probably the most religious living</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.620" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">religious experience in probably that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:43.020" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe it&#39;s ever happened right</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:43.290" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.020" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:47.130" style="s2">and what&#39;s so interesting about Hydra</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">about Burning Man is you is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.130" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">explicitly religious it&#39;s I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">at this point a hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">or something like that show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">middle of the desert right like flat</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:01.860" style="s2">salt flats in in Nevada</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">yeah and build a city with the man right</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.860" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">know three or four story you know man</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:09.709" style="s2">that they burn at the end of it mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:13.410" style="s2">the man doesn&#39;t symbolize anything and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.709" end="00:04:14.910" style="s2">no one&#39;s meeting for any reason and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.410" end="00:04:19.230" style="s2">filled with you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.910" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">originally started as a bunch of modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.230" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">artists postmodern artists basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">like in people they basically come and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">they can and they make these art cars</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:32.010" style="s2">and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">wild you know wild camps and obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.010" end="00:04:38.130" style="s2">courses and it&#39;s a it&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:40.260" style="s2">experience so diesel started the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.130" end="00:04:43.530" style="s2">circling concept come out of that or was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.260" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">a taken to like as a attitude towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.530" end="00:04:49.350" style="s2">that kind of event I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">like I think it&#39;s more like the context</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.350" end="00:04:59.729" style="s2">or the space that Burning Man opens up</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:01.740" style="s2">it makes sense to me that the six of us</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.729" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">six or seven of us that discovered</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.740" end="00:05:05.760" style="s2">circling discovered it there but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t something that like was put on by</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.760" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">Burning Man or something like that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.080" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">was something that just happened because</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:11.970" style="s2">there&#39;s you could say that another thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:13.350" style="s2">about Burning Man is you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.970" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a place where profound</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.350" end="00:05:18.780" style="s2">conversations get started and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">Twitter got started there apparently if</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.780" end="00:05:22.710" style="s2">you&#39;re high up in Google there they</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">require you to go to Burning Man every</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.710" end="00:05:27.780" style="s2">year and so yeah it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.150" style="s2">space where mind just become something</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.780" end="00:05:33.090" style="s2">extraordinary mm-hmm and at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.150" end="00:05:34.919" style="s2">it I mean the to the the other person I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.090" end="00:05:36.419" style="s2">was with Jerry Candelaria him and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.919" end="00:05:38.760" style="s2">became kind of you could say the two</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.419" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">people that were ended up just naturally</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.760" end="00:05:43.950" style="s2">guiding the experience ourselves guiding</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">the experience and afterwards we got</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.950" end="00:05:48.660" style="s2">done and Jerry came up to me he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">that he went like this was his finger</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.660" end="00:05:53.070" style="s2">that thing that just happened I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">yeah that the thing that was something</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.070" end="00:05:55.970" style="s2">right it was like yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:05:59.789" style="s2">something extraordinary like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.970" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">mm-hmm and so we just shook hands on it</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.789" end="00:06:03.270" style="s2">in that moment and we just committed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">bring it out into the world and we had</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.270" end="00:06:09.539" style="s2">no idea what that was or what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">out of that handshake hmm became</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.539" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">something that then later became called</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:16.470" style="s2">circling that started all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">communities in the Bay Area that started</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.470" end="00:06:22.260" style="s2">a whole lot like like emerged a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">vocabulary that is now emerging all over</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.260" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">the world it&#39;s in Europe it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">it&#39;s in Australia yeah all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:32.220" style="s2">what&#39;s the I&#39;ve got two points to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:33.750" style="s2">but I want to quickly go to this one</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.220" end="00:06:37.080" style="s2">because the first thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.750" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">what&#39;s the applicability of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.080" end="00:06:41.130" style="s2">system of thought in terms of real</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:43.050" style="s2">relation relating</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.130" end="00:06:46.830" style="s2">to the other which i think is what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.050" end="00:06:48.480" style="s2">boils down to but in a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.830" end="00:06:50.760" style="s2">ontological sense not so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.480" end="00:06:52.650" style="s2">psychological little character</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.650" end="00:06:57.720" style="s2">deeper than that how do you apply that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:06:58.830" style="s2">broadly you know in the in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.720" end="00:07:02.310" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing that circling now</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:05.640" style="s2">becoming a worldwide phenomenon happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.310" end="00:07:08.100" style="s2">what it looks like is that people start</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.640" end="00:07:11.100" style="s2">communities that they gather together</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.100" end="00:07:12.690" style="s2">and they and they do circling right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.100" end="00:07:15.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a way that a group that people work</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.690" end="00:07:19.320" style="s2">in a group it&#39;s also a lot of coaches</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.420" end="00:07:20.580" style="s2">and psychotherapists and this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.320" end="00:07:22.590" style="s2">interesting is like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.580" end="00:07:23.760" style="s2">things that kind of look like that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.590" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">it does something very distinct about</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.760" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">circling in that most group work you</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:31.290" style="s2">could say are psychological and base</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">rate which is that you can say the kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.290" end="00:07:36.390" style="s2">of ontological understanding or premise</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:39.000" style="s2">underneath psychology isn&#39;t is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.390" end="00:07:41.580" style="s2">medical right or it&#39;s about healing</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.000" end="00:07:43.260" style="s2">which has a whole ontology so when</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.580" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">somebody puts the attention like in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.260" end="00:07:46.890" style="s2">classical like Gestalt group or</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">something like that the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.890" end="00:07:51.660" style="s2">everyone&#39;s attention is on them is for</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:54.030" style="s2">some kind of growth or change to happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.660" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">with circling that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.030" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s like actually like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.740" end="00:08:00.510" style="s2">deviating away from the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:02.670" style="s2">circling the whole the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.510" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">circling is is is that we&#39;re all engaged</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.670" end="00:08:08.220" style="s2">in in the practice of being with what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:10.980" style="s2">right or what I like to say more</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.220" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">poetically put how profoundly can we be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.980" end="00:08:17.100" style="s2">with what is and and to me this is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:19.200" style="s2">we start to get into Heidegger in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.100" end="00:08:21.750" style="s2">sense of that to me we start to engage</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.200" end="00:08:25.920" style="s2">in how you get at that right how do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.750" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">get at is right um Society would say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.920" end="00:08:33.270" style="s2">the event of truth or the event of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:35.820" style="s2">philosophy yeah right that happens right</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.270" end="00:08:38.490" style="s2">so it&#39;s like um so instead of good like</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.820" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">you know asking Quentin is person</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.490" end="00:08:43.169" style="s2">questions in order to fix or change them</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">we&#39;re more asking questions in relating</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.169" end="00:08:48.030" style="s2">and listening and speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:50.790" style="s2">dialoguing to find out what is for that</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.910" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">say the I&#39;ve a sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.770" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">right like not relating because because</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:10.520" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m trying to fix you right</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:02.400" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain that I think that I there</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:37.140" style="s2">when you start you know becoming a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.080" end="00:10:39.590" style="s2">more primal and looking at it as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.140" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">just seeing the other person for them</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.990" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">and you get far more out of it than you</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.869" end="00:11:40.249" style="s2">what you&#39;re going into this circling</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.309" end="00:11:41.540" style="s2">seems to be because you keep saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.249" end="00:11:44.269" style="s2">still learning what it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.540" end="00:11:46.579" style="s2">I think that&#39;s inevitable when you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.269" end="00:11:48.230" style="s2">down to these levels or up you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.579" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">imagine it down or up I&#39;d imagine it as</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.230" end="00:11:54.019" style="s2">a ground to allow all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:55.879" style="s2">artificialities to occur that&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.019" end="00:11:57.290" style="s2">good view but you can imagine it as an</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.290" end="00:12:01.189" style="s2">towards this kind of transcendent</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.189" end="00:12:05.809" style="s2">think what best friends have best</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.699" end="00:12:20.929" style="s2">you know what I mean so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.709" end="00:12:23.899" style="s2">that clarifies it a bit that would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.929" end="00:12:25.999" style="s2">see circling as some similar something</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.899" end="00:12:29.569" style="s2">kind of an approach that approximates</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.999" end="00:12:32.149" style="s2">that it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.149" end="00:12:35.540" style="s2">know one of the things that Heidegger&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.980" end="00:12:55.939" style="s2">really difficult to start to get at that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.449" end="00:13:00.439" style="s2">right because if you think about it you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.939" end="00:13:03.319" style="s2">know we constantly comport the world as</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:48.790" style="s2">would say the tricky part is that what</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.390" end="00:13:50.950" style="s2">philosophy and always trying to dump try</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.790" end="00:13:55.060" style="s2">to try to understand being by making it</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.060" end="00:13:58.840" style="s2">the tricky part right that&#39;s the tricky</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.220" end="00:14:01.660" style="s2">part is you can&#39;t in order to understand</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.840" end="00:15:28.840" style="s2">looked back at history in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.910" end="00:15:31.990" style="s2">was the pre thematic right the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.840" end="00:15:35.170" style="s2">already always understanding of being at</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.990" end="00:15:35.560" style="s2">different epochs in history right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.170" end="00:15:37.720" style="s2">you could say</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.560" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">like the Industrial Revolution was and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.720" end="00:15:41.620" style="s2">this is what cogs and the car and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:43.960" style="s2">know all these different people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.620" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">set up which it was subject object to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.960" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">being like disclose itself as subject</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:51.550" style="s2">objects and where this effect is trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.190" end="00:15:53.620" style="s2">to overcome the dominance of the object</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.550" end="00:15:56.520" style="s2">or overcome nature and all those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.620" end="00:15:58.690" style="s2">of things you could say that like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.520" end="00:16:01.810" style="s2">presupposes an understanding of being</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.690" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s different than say like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.810" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">Greeks the early Greeks which was more</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:09.510" style="s2">like you can see it in their art is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:12.339" style="s2">being was more like a APIs or a flow or</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.510" end="00:16:14.020" style="s2">bringing forth right more like a river</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.339" end="00:16:16.270" style="s2">or something like exactly well date</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.020" end="00:16:18.820" style="s2">dicots a good you brought up Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.270" end="00:16:19.630" style="s2">he&#39;s famous cookie dough some I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.820" end="00:16:22.300" style="s2">therefore I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.630" end="00:16:24.460" style="s2">it&#39;s the classic kind of like I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.300" end="00:16:27.700" style="s2">modern philosophical concept of what it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.460" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">means to exist yeah built on like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.700" end="00:16:32.050" style="s2">said those classical and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.880" style="s2">classical concepts of being so you never</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.050" end="00:16:36.400" style="s2">had Greek saying I think therefore I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.880" end="00:16:39.100" style="s2">but really they said I know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.400" end="00:16:40.780" style="s2">nothing I know I&#39;m not nothing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.100" end="00:16:42.820" style="s2">double negative so therefore you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.780" end="00:16:44.080" style="s2">and then Greeks love double negatives</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.820" end="00:16:46.180" style="s2">and they loved all this wordplay and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.080" end="00:16:48.010" style="s2">Heidegger did too so it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.180" end="00:16:51.460" style="s2">how they thought because they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.010" end="00:16:54.040" style="s2">quite say I am because yeah but they</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.460" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">said I know I&#39;m not nothing so and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.040" end="00:16:58.330" style="s2">they were thinking much more that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:17:02.170" style="s2">was the heart he was like no they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.330" end="00:17:04.260" style="s2">on to something it&#39;s just we you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.170" end="00:17:06.610" style="s2">notice like as you&#39;re going okay what</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.260" end="00:17:08.530" style="s2">they know they&#39;re not nothing so notice</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.610" end="00:17:11.920" style="s2">notice how you had to enter into that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.530" end="00:17:15.160" style="s2">thought grappling with it right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.920" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.160" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:21.790" style="s2">getting at is that it&#39;s important for us</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:24.040" style="s2">as human beings because we&#39;re the being</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.790" end="00:17:26.500" style="s2">that is concerned about our being and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.040" end="00:17:29.800" style="s2">can be concerned about being as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.500" end="00:17:32.350" style="s2">yeah right we take our you know our</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.800" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">being is a is how you would say our</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.350" end="00:17:38.770" style="s2">being is an issue for us there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:40.300" style="s2">certain kind of like I would say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.770" end="00:17:41.530" style="s2">really come to come to realize and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.300" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">is kind of what brings back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.530" end="00:17:47.800" style="s2">to circling to is that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:49.539" style="s2">ethic right to that that in in that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.800" end="00:17:52.570" style="s2">in a certain sense are a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.539" end="00:17:57.009" style="s2">you know we are kind of we are a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.570" end="00:17:59.769" style="s2">clearing for we are clearing for a world</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.009" end="00:18:02.259" style="s2">to occur yeah and that we aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.769" end="00:18:06.159" style="s2">thing this was tricky about being human</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.259" end="00:18:10.119" style="s2">right is like it&#39;s like where we</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.159" end="00:18:12.159" style="s2">disclose a world of things yet we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.119" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">one of the things it&#39;s disclosed like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.159" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">other things we have a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:17.979" style="s2">being right that makes possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:20.619" style="s2">something like a thing to be disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.979" end="00:18:23.409" style="s2">or uncovered if you will yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.619" end="00:18:26.109" style="s2">so like a Sam Harris or a Richard</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.409" end="00:18:29.409" style="s2">Dawkins would be saying no we&#39;re animals</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.109" end="00:18:31.149" style="s2">literally descendants of apes with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.409" end="00:18:34.029" style="s2">highly developed brain and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.149" end="00:18:36.429" style="s2">neurophysiology it&#39;s like yes but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.029" end="00:18:41.349" style="s2">also a hundred other things one of which</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.429" end="00:18:43.389" style="s2">is like you say this opening up of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.349" end="00:18:46.059" style="s2">much more transcendental kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.389" end="00:18:48.940" style="s2">existence that say apes don&#39;t have or</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.059" end="00:18:50.889" style="s2">can&#39;t have you know animals generally</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.940" end="00:18:52.989" style="s2">can&#39;t have that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.889" end="00:18:55.509" style="s2">different because they allow for say the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.989" end="00:18:58.509" style="s2">concepts of calculus and mathematics to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.509" end="00:19:01.649" style="s2">open up on top of what we normally do as</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.509" end="00:19:04.090" style="s2">a biological species and this leads to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.649" end="00:19:06.509" style="s2">conceptions of black holes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.090" end="00:19:09.070" style="s2">creations of atomic bombs and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.509" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just you can&#39;t just limit it to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.070" end="00:19:15.309" style="s2">this fact achill being in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:18.549" style="s2">Hollywood term it it starts getting much</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.309" end="00:19:20.979" style="s2">more complicated deeper you kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.549" end="00:19:23.979" style="s2">down so but what is human being capital</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.979" end="00:19:26.019" style="s2">B we know a human being small beer we</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.979" end="00:19:28.359" style="s2">know what each one of us we can look up</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.019" end="00:19:30.820" style="s2">in a medical textbook what we are that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.359" end="00:19:33.460" style="s2">fine but we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.820" end="00:19:35.559" style="s2">collective being is and there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.460" end="00:19:38.470" style="s2">a collective being if we are all of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.559" end="00:19:40.659" style="s2">same you know we have the same biology</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.470" end="00:19:44.470" style="s2">we have the same infrastructure in our</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.659" end="00:19:47.379" style="s2">heads so the thoughts we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.470" end="00:19:49.029" style="s2">the ideas we put out into the world the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.379" end="00:19:53.349" style="s2">languages we use you know everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.029" end="00:19:54.940" style="s2">like that has the sum total and breaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.349" end="00:19:58.210" style="s2">through how we view the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.940" end="00:20:00.789" style="s2">scientifically and fact eclis so to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.210" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">speak so just like that there is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.789" end="00:20:04.620" style="s2">mentality was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:06.659" style="s2">just highlighted when i tried to say we</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.620" end="00:20:08.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t nothing which still confuses me</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.659" end="00:20:11.700" style="s2">when i say it because conceptualizing</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.740" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">important right like we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:25.409" style="s2">worth the movement of thinking starts to</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.090" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">happening all of a sudden it stops right</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.610" end="00:20:43.830" style="s2">and there&#39;s this clearing or this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:46.889" style="s2">opening say that concealment of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.830" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">opening right is the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.889" end="00:20:51.450" style="s2">that happen in something like circling</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">right where it&#39;s like i&#39;m relating to</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.610" end="00:21:11.159" style="s2">that a being but there&#39;s this disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.370" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">that happens that there&#39;s this ungood</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.159" end="00:21:16.980" style="s2">like the the unconcealed this right gets</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.010" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">profoundness that can be just utterly</p>

<p begin="00:21:27.240" end="00:21:30.990" style="s2">walked in one way and they walked out</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.039" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">another way in a way that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.990" end="00:21:36.750" style="s2">describe but the world the world occurs</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.230" end="00:21:39.960" style="s2">to them differently and of course all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.750" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">our actions as i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.960" end="00:21:44.909" style="s2">gregory bateson really points out that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:48.350" style="s2">that all all behavior is a function of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.909" end="00:21:51.269" style="s2">perception so if if how you perceive</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.350" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">radically changes how you act will</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.269" end="00:21:57.049" style="s2">change as well i&#39;ve seen over and over</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">and over and over again through this</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.049" end="00:22:01.380" style="s2">like just sitting with somebody or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">group of people sitting with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.380" end="00:22:07.110" style="s2">and just being with what is right and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">you follow is all the way down you end</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.110" end="00:22:10.620" style="s2">up in these places of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:13.139" style="s2">deepest mysteries in the whole universe</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.620" end="00:22:14.580" style="s2">oh yeah definitely and i&#39;d like the best</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.139" end="00:22:16.620" style="s2">example i could think of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.580" end="00:22:19.500" style="s2">psychology and behavior being a function</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.620" end="00:22:21.900" style="s2">of perception is just look at religious</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.900" end="00:22:26.280" style="s2">Isis or something like that it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.270" end="00:22:27.630" style="s2">can&#39;t comprehend doing that but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.280" end="00:22:30.390" style="s2">obviously don&#39;t have their perception</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.630" end="00:22:31.980" style="s2">about the world their perception informs</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.390" end="00:22:33.710" style="s2">the fact that they can take a plane</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.980" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">right over to Syria or wherever and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.710" end="00:22:38.309" style="s2">become these horrible you know</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.100" end="00:22:50.970" style="s2">comes first you know chicken or the egg</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.630" end="00:22:53.070" style="s2">do they is it just they acting like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.970" end="00:22:54.540" style="s2">and they convince themselves that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.070" end="00:22:57.570" style="s2">right or they isn&#39;t really coming from</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.540" end="00:23:01.350" style="s2">somewhere deeper like what you said like</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.570" end="00:23:04.170" style="s2">getting in someone&#39;s head getting in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.350" end="00:23:05.910" style="s2">someone&#39;s head there&#39;s that quality of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.170" end="00:23:09.510" style="s2">like that&#39;s a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.910" end="00:23:12.350" style="s2">attempting to understand to stand over</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.510" end="00:23:15.809" style="s2">right never to over stand versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.350" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">understand there&#39;s a humility there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.809" end="00:23:19.320" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality of them entering</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:21.630" style="s2">into something and there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.320" end="00:23:23.850" style="s2">this way or this background sense of</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.850" end="00:23:30.630" style="s2">to really know to get in your head I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.170" end="00:23:32.850" style="s2">must in some way be changed by that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.630" end="00:23:34.860" style="s2">right in in the process of understanding</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.500" end="00:23:46.309" style="s2">different in some way once I that right</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.250" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">I&#39;m just thinking applicability wise how</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.309" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">important something like circling B to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">say I&#39;m a policy when you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">with people things like radicalization</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:58.710" style="s2">or you know race hate groups and people</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:00.059" style="s2">whose views are just so outside the</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.059" end="00:24:04.380" style="s2">understand the resentments and problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.270" style="s2">but we have to tackle it with force and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.380" end="00:24:07.170" style="s2">crackdown using the law and all that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.270" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re not really using</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.170" end="00:24:11.820" style="s2">understand in its correct meaning there</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:14.040" style="s2">you&#39;re like you said you&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.820" end="00:24:16.290" style="s2">standing you&#39;re objectifying studying</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">the problem categorizing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.290" end="00:24:20.160" style="s2">making a policy about it you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:21.990" style="s2">really understanding it like government</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.160" end="00:24:23.580" style="s2">is an understanding at all whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.990" end="00:24:25.700" style="s2">organization is an understanding at</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.580" end="00:24:28.140" style="s2">police aren&#39;t understanding it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.700" end="00:24:31.500" style="s2">applicability here that I think would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.140" end="00:24:34.310" style="s2">vital to solving some of these cultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.500" end="00:24:37.020" style="s2">and racial tensions that happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.310" end="00:24:39.750" style="s2">discussion America but like anywhere in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.020" end="00:24:42.990" style="s2">the world if you had approaches like</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.750" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">this to policy I think just from my own</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.990" end="00:24:47.910" style="s2">kind of perspective that would be really</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">interesting and I would wonder and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.910" end="00:24:52.800" style="s2">could lead you know like you get a bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:55.290" style="s2">more of a deeper understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.800" end="00:24:59.930" style="s2">psychology and the behavior of people by</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.290" end="00:25:04.290" style="s2">going to this kind of comportment of not</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.930" end="00:25:07.230" style="s2">there is but all right now let me just</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.290" end="00:25:09.180" style="s2">understand what&#39;s in your head coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.230" end="00:25:10.560" style="s2">from what your perceptions are and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.180" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">they&#39;re similar to like where&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.560" end="00:25:13.710" style="s2">commonality because there has to become</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:17.310" style="s2">an ala D with humans you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">mean all this stuff I think is just you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.310" end="00:25:21.300" style="s2">know Heidegger sounds very theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:23.010" style="s2">but when you actually start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.300" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">things like this there&#39;s huge scope</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.010" end="00:25:29.280" style="s2">totally it&#39;s interesting I it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:32.040" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s more like I think Heidegger I</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.280" end="00:25:34.890" style="s2">would say has a method a method right</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.040" end="00:25:37.590" style="s2">you know he he invites people not to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.890" end="00:25:42.360" style="s2">like he invites people you could say to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.590" end="00:25:44.700" style="s2">go on the way of thought now if I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.360" end="00:25:46.170" style="s2">that if I know where I&#39;m going if I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.700" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">where I&#39;m gonna end up ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.170" end="00:25:52.500" style="s2">which is what most people call thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">or made it right that&#39;s he would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.500" end="00:25:57.540" style="s2">that that&#39;s not real thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:26:00.300" style="s2">exactly like as you said that when did</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.540" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">he say that being there right that did</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.300" end="00:26:05.580" style="s2">being done was something totally like on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">some level I&#39;ve already got something</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.580" end="00:26:09.930" style="s2">wrapped up and whatever when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:11.910" style="s2">whatever phenomena I&#39;m looking at all</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.930" end="00:26:14.460" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is to gather evidence for what</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.910" end="00:26:16.230" style="s2">I already know rise I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.460" end="00:26:18.420" style="s2">perhaps it would be a good idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.230" end="00:26:22.650" style="s2">begin to hear something other than we</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.420" end="00:26:25.050" style="s2">already think yeah it&#39;s like I am saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.650" end="00:26:28.680" style="s2">I&#39;m coming exploring right and I follow</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.050" end="00:26:30.810" style="s2">a map to the end of the the jogging</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.680" end="00:26:32.100" style="s2">route or the hiking route it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.810" end="00:26:34.590" style="s2">you&#39;re not exploring I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.100" end="00:26:36.150" style="s2">walking through a route and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.590" end="00:26:38.670" style="s2">seeing things on the way that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.150" end="00:26:40.500" style="s2">interesting and so on and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.670" end="00:26:41.190" style="s2">objectifying them and stuff and studying</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.500" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">them in your own</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.190" end="00:26:45.750" style="s2">I got really exploring exploring would</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:46.950" style="s2">be throwing away a map and walking down</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.750" end="00:26:50.010" style="s2">a path and seeing where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.950" end="00:26:51.420" style="s2">obviously not well advised but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.010" end="00:26:53.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what Jordan peterson was saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.420" end="00:26:54.810" style="s2">the people who have remembered the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:56.820" style="s2">people to gather the most knowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.810" end="00:26:59.640" style="s2">the past were the ones who stepped out</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.820" end="00:27:02.790" style="s2">into the chaos she challenged themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.640" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">mentally and physically and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.790" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">relating that to Heidegger is really</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">important I think because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:10.590" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to do that&#39;s why he</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:12.780" style="s2">struggles to get the language to work</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.590" end="00:27:15.690" style="s2">like he puts so much strain on language</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.780" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed like it&#39;s strange German</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.690" end="00:27:19.290" style="s2">which is what he spoke but then when</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.540" style="s2">it&#39;s translated in English it gets even</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.290" end="00:27:24.360" style="s2">near breaking point to the point we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.540" end="00:27:27.330" style="s2">to invent new words just to get at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.360" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">exact kind of idea and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">be precise when talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:32.700" style="s2">things because otherwise it gets very</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">blurry and kind of all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.700" end="00:27:35.940" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re telling that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:37.890" style="s2">but going back to that point exploring</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.940" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">this just walking along a path that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.890" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">really bent read that is really the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.140" end="00:27:45.150" style="s2">problem with like thinking nowadays like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">in the modern era when you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.150" end="00:27:50.340" style="s2">people argue or have a debate you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.590" style="s2">to get the idea out of it it&#39;s like not</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.340" end="00:27:54.030" style="s2">really it&#39;s they&#39;re not really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.590" end="00:27:56.460" style="s2">they&#39;re not really debating they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.030" end="00:27:58.790" style="s2">kind of going down familiar routes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.460" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">they&#39;ve tried a thousand times before</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.790" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">and repeating it and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:09.540" style="s2">that&#39;s conducive to progress to new</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">knowledge to new understanding of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.540" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">know human being capital B it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:15.930" style="s2">that is not the way to it that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:18.950" style="s2">like the path in the opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.930" end="00:28:22.350" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been going since you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">since Greece fell under you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.350" end="00:28:28.980" style="s2">completely compartmentalised knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">and I always kind of I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.980" end="00:28:34.260" style="s2">podcast was but might have been joining</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:36.300" style="s2">Peterson and Steven Molyneux I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.260" end="00:28:39.480" style="s2">remember but they were talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.300" end="00:28:40.970" style="s2">universities no matter in sam harris but</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.480" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">they were to me at how universities</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.970" end="00:28:47.400" style="s2">basically compartmentalized knowledge if</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:51.200" style="s2">you go to a college campus you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.400" end="00:28:53.610" style="s2">signs that go biology department history</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">humanities and all that and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.610" end="00:28:57.179" style="s2">well there is some</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">to that just for resourcing and you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.179" end="00:29:02.370" style="s2">administrative reasons but the human</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:04.710" style="s2">mind doesn&#39;t work that way thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.370" end="00:29:06.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way the world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.710" end="00:29:08.250" style="s2">work that way so why are we teaching</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.389" end="00:29:10.110" style="s2">people that way then I always find that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.250" end="00:29:11.909" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s not to say everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.110" end="00:29:14.730" style="s2">to be a polymath or someone who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.909" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">expert in everything but it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.730" end="00:29:19.700" style="s2">said this into subjectivity this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:22.380" style="s2">interconnectedness of thought and being</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.700" end="00:29:26.070" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.380" end="00:29:27.149" style="s2">really just gonna I&#39;m gonna be lost if</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:29.880" style="s2">you think about it that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.149" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">interconnected vests okay we if we ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.880" end="00:29:37.380" style="s2">ourselves okay how do we see how do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:40.139" style="s2">begin to hear the interconnectedness of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.380" end="00:29:42.539" style="s2">things and how do we lose how do we not</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.139" end="00:29:45.059" style="s2">hear it how do we not see it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.539" end="00:29:48.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like I think it comes part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.059" end="00:29:50.820" style="s2">second half is the hottest how do we not</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.450" end="00:29:52.679" style="s2">see it because by definition we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.820" end="00:29:54.630" style="s2">know what we don&#39;t know right here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.679" end="00:29:57.000" style="s2">thing that I really enjoy about Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.630" end="00:29:59.429" style="s2">now Peter said actually later you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.000" end="00:30:02.669" style="s2">really know about Heidegger until well</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.429" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">after his work and then realized that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.669" end="00:30:06.510" style="s2">they were kind of starting to get it the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:08.010" style="s2">same thing hmm that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.510" end="00:30:10.740" style="s2">and I think it comes down to what Peter</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.010" end="00:30:14.820" style="s2">like a Peters kind of understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.740" end="00:30:17.399" style="s2">respect about the grappling what it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.820" end="00:30:19.500" style="s2">to grapple with thought which is on some</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.399" end="00:30:22.200" style="s2">levels with what brings us to something</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.500" end="00:30:24.750" style="s2">like reality it&#39;s like one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.200" end="00:30:26.820" style="s2">the way he puts it he&#39;s like okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.750" end="00:30:28.860" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.820" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">we know is the category of what we know</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.860" end="00:30:32.039" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the category of that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.350" style="s2">don&#39;t like we know that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.039" end="00:30:36.690" style="s2">and then this thing then we all know</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.350" end="00:30:39.690" style="s2">that there so there&#39;s a whole category</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.690" end="00:30:41.130" style="s2">of everything that we don&#39;t know and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.690" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know but we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.130" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">know that how do we represent that which</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.480" end="00:30:51.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:54.090" style="s2">the fact that I can say it right like</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.350" end="00:30:56.549" style="s2">means that I must be able to comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.090" end="00:31:00.330" style="s2">it in some way but how the hell do I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.549" end="00:31:02.130" style="s2">represent something that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.330" end="00:31:05.820" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.130" end="00:31:08.060" style="s2">but I know it hmm right that to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.820" end="00:31:11.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a really great way of disclose</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.060" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to feel back in to write</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.920" end="00:31:16.010" style="s2">something like what Heidegger was</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:19.820" style="s2">pointing to when he said the being of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.010" end="00:31:22.760" style="s2">beings right and and I think that like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.820" end="00:31:24.050" style="s2">what you could say is that I think one</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.760" end="00:31:25.640" style="s2">of the things that you pointed to is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.050" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">that people really don&#39;t think much</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.640" end="00:31:29.750" style="s2">anymore that&#39;s more like they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:31.400" style="s2">like they kind of they point their faces</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.750" end="00:31:34.580" style="s2">at each other and then shoot cannons</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.400" end="00:31:36.200" style="s2">right and if my thought is bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.580" end="00:31:38.210" style="s2">your thought right and you get it easily</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:40.280" style="s2">especially the internet is just filled</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.210" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">with this like it festers with that kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.280" end="00:31:44.390" style="s2">of stuff right it&#39;s just it&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:47.300" style="s2">like bringing my kind of ancient history</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.390" end="00:31:50.540" style="s2">interests it&#39;s like we have worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.300" end="00:31:52.460" style="s2">sophistry we&#39;ve enabled Sophos you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.540" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">the types who were paid to just make</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.460" end="00:31:56.120" style="s2">arguments in ancient Greece they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.980" style="s2">like philosophers like Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.120" end="00:32:00.890" style="s2">Socrates hated them because they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.980" end="00:32:02.390" style="s2">paid professional trolls essentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.890" end="00:32:04.010" style="s2">like they would go out and just be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.390" end="00:32:05.420" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate and say well no</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.010" end="00:32:07.160" style="s2">actually you know I think the world is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.420" end="00:32:08.930" style="s2">made out of water and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.160" end="00:32:10.820" style="s2">fundamental element and here&#39;s why and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.930" end="00:32:12.500" style="s2">that actually be smart people like</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.820" end="00:32:16.550" style="s2">lawyers essentially and they just be</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.500" end="00:32:18.200" style="s2">able to create fancy arguments and never</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.550" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">ever change their mind they&#39;ll just be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.200" end="00:32:22.730" style="s2">like paid to say the same thing like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">propaganda pieces and it&#39;s I think now</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.730" end="00:32:26.510" style="s2">we have that on a global scale like we</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:28.400" style="s2">have people whether it&#39;s right wing left</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.510" end="00:32:29.620" style="s2">wing or whether it&#39;s Hillary Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.400" end="00:32:32.750" style="s2">Donald Trump or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.620" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">there is no coming together to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.750" end="00:32:37.220" style="s2">in the conflict come to a deeper truth</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.140" style="s2">about say what is politics or what does</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.220" end="00:32:42.410" style="s2">it mean to be a good leader it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:44.150" style="s2">actually don&#39;t kiss about that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.410" end="00:32:45.680" style="s2">not saying we&#39;re post fact I&#39;m not doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.150" end="00:32:48.110" style="s2">at that I&#39;m actually talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.680" end="00:32:50.570" style="s2">post thinking like there&#39;s no time to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.110" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">think anymore in this hiding a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.570" end="00:32:56.030" style="s2">this ancient Greek sense in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:58.550" style="s2">philosophical sense it&#39;s more how can I</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.030" end="00:33:00.860" style="s2">think in this route like I need a map to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.550" end="00:33:01.970" style="s2">tell me how to get from A to B whether</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.860" end="00:33:05.180" style="s2">it&#39;s in a debate or an online</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.970" end="00:33:07.070" style="s2">conversation or on a TV show and I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.180" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">all I have to do is tread the road get</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.070" end="00:33:10.850" style="s2">the main points ad and then get to B and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.870" end="00:33:13.090" style="s2">that&#39;s it and so why don&#39;t you just sit</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.850" end="00:33:16.100" style="s2">there and go with the flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.090" end="00:33:18.560" style="s2">let&#39;s see what happens did you think</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.100" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like I really like that and I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.560" end="00:33:21.740" style="s2">say that there is this real I think some</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:26.030" style="s2">of this is real</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.740" end="00:33:28.610" style="s2">based on a misconception of what of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.030" end="00:33:30.679" style="s2">something that we one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.610" end="00:33:32.809" style="s2">we don&#39;t see the interconnectedness of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.679" end="00:33:36.110" style="s2">things for the fuzzy would say the flow</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.809" end="00:33:39.410" style="s2">that would go if we saw it right is</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.110" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">actually not seeing but what is is such</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.410" end="00:33:46.700" style="s2">is the silence in which all discourse</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:48.950" style="s2">and speaking presupposes which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.700" end="00:33:51.530" style="s2">listening right because if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.950" end="00:33:54.170" style="s2">it like ontological II speaking right a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.530" end="00:33:56.210" style="s2">speaking is always a speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.170" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">presupposes the listening that calls</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.210" end="00:34:00.830" style="s2">forth speech right if there wasn&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.450" style="s2">there was no listening there would be no</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.830" end="00:34:05.540" style="s2">speech to be called forth and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.450" end="00:34:06.679" style="s2">ontologically is prior in presupposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.540" end="00:34:09.710" style="s2">language mmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.679" end="00:34:12.080" style="s2">when but we usually think about when we</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.710" end="00:34:14.510" style="s2">think about like dialogue we think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.080" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">talking right pointing our faces each</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.510" end="00:34:19.250" style="s2">other and making noise right but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think about like what&#39;s calling</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.250" end="00:34:22.610" style="s2">forth the conversation and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:25.639" style="s2">calling forth the conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.610" end="00:34:28.960" style="s2">something already already a relation is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.639" end="00:34:32.389" style="s2">there any tap into the relation through</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.960" end="00:34:34.190" style="s2">kind of listening and listening now</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.389" end="00:34:35.750" style="s2">listening in a very different sense like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.190" end="00:34:37.850" style="s2">I think that like the common sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.750" end="00:34:39.050" style="s2">understanding of listening is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:40.970" style="s2">good listener or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.050" end="00:34:43.369" style="s2">it&#39;s like I have an empty head right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.970" end="00:34:45.409" style="s2">I kind of like a I pull my head up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.369" end="00:34:47.060" style="s2">as you talk you fill it with words and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.409" end="00:34:48.889" style="s2">advice if I shut up long enough right</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.060" end="00:34:51.369" style="s2">and you and the words fill up and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.889" end="00:34:53.990" style="s2">close it and you&#39;re like okay you get me</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.369" end="00:34:56.330" style="s2">basically that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.990" end="00:34:58.940" style="s2">listening listening listening is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.330" end="00:35:01.340" style="s2">synonymous with interpretation right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.940" end="00:35:03.290" style="s2">as high-degree would say that human</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.340" end="00:35:05.000" style="s2">being is the being that&#39;s interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.290" end="00:35:08.060" style="s2">all the way down in other words we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.000" end="00:35:11.930" style="s2">meaning all the way down right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.060" end="00:35:15.050" style="s2">listening right is it is it just being</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.930" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">quiet right hearing what you say no</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.050" end="00:35:21.410" style="s2">listening is where I&#39;m opening up right</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:23.570" style="s2">the very structures of the way I make</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.410" end="00:35:26.470" style="s2">sense right it&#39;s another way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.570" end="00:35:29.390" style="s2">as Heidegger said I open up my authentic</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.470" end="00:35:33.880" style="s2">care my concern fulness or the way I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.390" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">make sense of making sense and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.880" end="00:35:38.410" style="s2">understanding you in listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:41.290" style="s2">to you that the way I make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.410" end="00:35:44.770" style="s2">even like in profound listening the deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.290" end="00:35:46.950" style="s2">structures in which that make anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.770" end="00:35:49.240" style="s2">at all comprehensible to me in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.950" end="00:35:51.490" style="s2">understanding you I begin to change</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.240" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">those things and in that change that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.490" end="00:35:56.770" style="s2">then maybe speak or maybe do in silence</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:58.089" style="s2">when I disclose that change to you and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.770" end="00:36:00.520" style="s2">it&#39;s happening probably right now on</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.089" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">some level right as I disclose that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.520" end="00:36:04.839" style="s2">change to you is the process of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:08.650" style="s2">feeling understood or you feeling hurt</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.839" end="00:36:11.140" style="s2">right quiet right or being convinced</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.650" end="00:36:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s being willing to be altered or</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.140" end="00:36:17.710" style="s2">changed by a dialogue right putting</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.170" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">yourself in a comportment that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.710" end="00:36:23.020" style="s2">extremely open to change</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:24.849" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m like a level and I love</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.020" end="00:36:26.980" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s example okay I think he took</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.849" end="00:36:29.230" style="s2">it from PJ or someone who keeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.980" end="00:36:31.780" style="s2">mentioning but like psychology in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.230" end="00:36:32.920" style="s2">sense of you have a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.780" end="00:36:34.839" style="s2">when you listen and you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.920" end="00:36:37.930" style="s2">properly the only way you can listen</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.839" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">properties if you care about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.930" end="00:36:42.069" style="s2">being said if you&#39;re listening for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:44.410" style="s2">listening stats sake and a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.069" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">listening like yeah I hear what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.410" end="00:36:47.980" style="s2">saying but it&#39;s like now you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:49.930" style="s2">everybody says that you&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.980" end="00:36:51.730" style="s2">this and you&#39;re just waiting to say a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.930" end="00:36:53.559" style="s2">point that you can tell that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.730" end="00:36:55.000" style="s2">conversation even if you observe you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.559" end="00:36:57.069" style="s2">people on TV it&#39;s like that guy didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.000" end="00:36:59.619" style="s2">even listen to what he said but if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.069" end="00:37:02.819" style="s2">actually care you shut up you will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.619" end="00:37:05.640" style="s2">quiet and things will die and be reborn</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.819" end="00:37:08.140" style="s2">inside your own soul like in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.640" end="00:37:10.180" style="s2">ontological or spiritual sense whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.140" end="00:37:12.520" style="s2">you want to call it you will literally</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.180" end="00:37:13.630" style="s2">have ideas that&#39;ll just be resurrected</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.520" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">and so I never thought of it like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:18.069" style="s2">way I did know about it but not in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:20.140" style="s2">sense or I thought of it this way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.069" end="00:37:23.049" style="s2">made its point I&#39;m convinced that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:24.910" style="s2">wrong way and that&#39;s dead so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.049" end="00:37:27.460" style="s2">there&#39;s existence non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.910" end="00:37:29.170" style="s2">happening in turn all the time and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.460" end="00:37:31.450" style="s2">for me is i if you&#39;re actually listening</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.170" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">that will be like a I don&#39;t know that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.450" end="00:37:39.250" style="s2">be like an actual feeling that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:41.170" style="s2">experience inside and yeah I am I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.250" end="00:37:43.869" style="s2">I&#39;m not in the sense of I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.170" end="00:37:47.470" style="s2">challenged to think a different way so</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.869" end="00:37:47.980" style="s2">much as I&#39;m getting more ideas that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.470" end="00:37:50.350" style="s2">narration</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.980" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">articulated yeah probably because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.350" end="00:37:56.500" style="s2">wanted to but no one cares about hiding</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">its food on one level we could say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.500" end="00:38:01.390" style="s2">like you could say you&#39;re speaking right</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:03.400" style="s2">now right is being disclosed in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.390" end="00:38:06.100" style="s2">mutual care but specifically in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.400" end="00:38:10.840" style="s2">dialectic in this moment spray is being</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.100" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">disclosed or being in the I&#39;m I&#39;m my</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.840" end="00:38:16.150" style="s2">listening is a is a space of unconcealed</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:18.310" style="s2">meant of new thought coming into being</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.150" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">exactly yeah gonna and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.310" end="00:38:25.710" style="s2">be willing and open to that change to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:28.090" style="s2">that yes you want new ideas to actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.710" end="00:38:30.310" style="s2">come into the clearing so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.090" end="00:38:32.050" style="s2">them and it&#39;s like there they are I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.310" end="00:38:34.330" style="s2">actually I recognize it but I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.050" end="00:38:35.740" style="s2">seen it in that light you know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.330" end="00:38:37.270" style="s2">seems to be what&#39;s happened now all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.740" end="00:38:40.810" style="s2">saying something for the first time that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.270" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking for years make sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.810" end="00:38:45.070" style="s2">will not make sense you know in my head</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:47.109" style="s2">and like this when I said that thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.070" end="00:38:48.730" style="s2">about not being nothing I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.109" end="00:38:52.060" style="s2">thought it and written it that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.730" end="00:38:53.650" style="s2">never articulated and it hits you in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.060" end="00:38:57.400" style="s2">very different way and it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.650" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">now I&#39;m sorry yeah that right there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.400" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">like that right there right there I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:05.350" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:07.330" style="s2">things you know we&#39;re you know our</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.350" end="00:39:10.390" style="s2">original like where we met was was</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.330" end="00:39:12.850" style="s2">through our interest in Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.390" end="00:39:14.680" style="s2">Peterson does right and he explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.850" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">talks about this he says when he tries</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.680" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">to model for his students is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">like in his classes if you watch him but</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">I think this is why people I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:25.090" style="s2">don&#39;t think people understand why they</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:26.530" style="s2">find him so compelling I think they</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.090" end="00:39:29.020" style="s2">tried they think that they find him so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.530" end="00:39:30.970" style="s2">compelling because of the content that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.020" end="00:39:33.310" style="s2">delivered but I actually think what</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.970" end="00:39:35.859" style="s2">makes him so compelling is that what</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.310" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s what he&#39;s doing right is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.859" end="00:39:42.010" style="s2">not presenting information he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.710" style="s2">informing people he&#39;s getting up and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.010" end="00:39:47.650" style="s2">he&#39;s engaging in a dialogue and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.710" end="00:39:51.310" style="s2">working out his thinking in a living way</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.650" end="00:39:53.140" style="s2">right so when you when you listen he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.310" end="00:39:54.609" style="s2">actually dialoguing with you and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.140" end="00:39:56.619" style="s2">what&#39;s a news is the interesting thing i</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.609" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">like i really like about and what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.619" end="00:40:01.420" style="s2">infectious about listening to him for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:02.260" style="s2">is it I feel like he&#39;s I&#39;m always being</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.420" end="00:40:04.180" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">I always feels like there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.180" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">which she&#39;s addressing me directly and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:11.080" style="s2">enough into understanding in order to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:14.530" style="s2">understand what he&#39;s saying right I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.080" end="00:40:18.550" style="s2">actually have to get over right at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.530" end="00:40:19.750" style="s2">edge of the there I am right now like if</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.550" end="00:40:21.100" style="s2">I just bring my said like that I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.750" end="00:40:23.380" style="s2">right it&#39;s right on the tip of my tongue</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.100" end="00:40:26.440" style="s2">right we&#39;re starting to we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.380" end="00:40:28.150" style="s2">to enter into the unknown right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.440" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">certain senses it&#39;s kind of chaotic but</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.150" end="00:40:32.140" style="s2">we&#39;re allowing thought to move towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:34.570" style="s2">what it doesn&#39;t know and it doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.140" end="00:40:35.980" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t know exactly know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.570" end="00:40:37.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to think about this the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.980" end="00:40:39.640" style="s2">whole time but like as I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.630" end="00:40:41.230" style="s2">it like I&#39;m becoming to like realize</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.640" end="00:40:43.660" style="s2">like oh I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.230" end="00:40:46.900" style="s2">and I&#39;m just bringing it into language</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.660" end="00:40:49.690" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s like hesitating you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.900" end="00:40:51.070" style="s2">confident in it it could evaporate at</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.690" end="00:40:52.470" style="s2">any minute because it&#39;s on the tip of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.070" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">your tongue but you&#39;ve got this whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.470" end="00:40:56.740" style="s2">structure of thought that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:40:59.110" style="s2">kind of get out there and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.740" end="00:41:00.520" style="s2">crap you know languages and keeping up</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.110" end="00:41:03.250" style="s2">with the brain it&#39;s like yeah obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.520" end="00:41:05.590" style="s2">because one is more original than the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.250" end="00:41:08.830" style="s2">other you know not so much the brain the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.590" end="00:41:10.390" style="s2">mind which con me it&#39;s like we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.830" end="00:41:12.760" style="s2">speech in the brain and you know one is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.390" end="00:41:15.670" style="s2">a product the other but the mind in fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.760" end="00:41:18.550" style="s2">graham&#39;s what you&#39;re speaking you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.670" end="00:41:20.500" style="s2">why you care why you care about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.550" end="00:41:24.100" style="s2">speech into the boat in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.500" end="00:41:27.070" style="s2">totally I think I want to put a book</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.100" end="00:41:29.980" style="s2">marker on care because that&#39;s a real big</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.070" end="00:41:33.340" style="s2">thing with with ID or what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.980" end="00:41:34.990" style="s2">what like what is scare break and if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.340" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">think about this thing about like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.990" end="00:41:40.270" style="s2">don&#39;t quite have that it&#39;s frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">or it can be daunting more insecure</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.270" end="00:41:47.530" style="s2">because I don&#39;t yet have like like like</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:50.110" style="s2">thought is ahead of language at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.530" end="00:41:51.220" style="s2">point mmm and you could say that like</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.110" end="00:41:53.020" style="s2">and this is what what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.220" end="00:41:56.130" style="s2">about Heidegger is that he had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.020" end="00:41:58.750" style="s2">practically invent a whole new language</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.130" end="00:42:01.330" style="s2">things and I think what that what that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.750" end="00:42:03.460" style="s2">is what what that shows is not that he</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.330" end="00:42:05.890" style="s2">was trying to be super smart or</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.460" end="00:42:07.630" style="s2">something is that he was he&#39;d followed</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.890" end="00:42:10.810" style="s2">the movement of thought that like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.630" end="00:42:13.480" style="s2">thought goes it goes ahead of language</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.810" end="00:42:14.920" style="s2">and then that the thought itself becomes</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.480" end="00:42:16.839" style="s2">like a listening</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.920" end="00:42:18.609" style="s2">right that draws forth a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.839" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">speech and you could say that language</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.609" end="00:42:23.470" style="s2">trail right right is that language trail</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.539" style="s2">that it leaves behind is a new</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.470" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">vocabulary it comes into being right</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.539" end="00:42:33.130" style="s2">yeah yeah and as also because the tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:35.319" style="s2">were given to speak have been given to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.130" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">us through past experience which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.319" end="00:42:40.450" style="s2">defined fact eclis you know school</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:43.869" style="s2">University family their education</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.450" end="00:42:46.809" style="s2">everything like that has a past and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.869" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">tools were given to express this just</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.809" end="00:42:52.390" style="s2">very primal kind of understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.900" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">human being what it is to live with</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.390" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">other human beings and share things in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:58.660" style="s2">common and think things in common or get</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:00.670" style="s2">to truths that we otherwise when the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.660" end="00:43:03.430" style="s2">thought of we&#39;ve suddenly find all those</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.670" end="00:43:08.440" style="s2">tools are very much limited or at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.430" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">hamstrung by circumstance and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.440" end="00:43:13.029" style="s2">so ya know I&#39;ve bookmarked the care</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:14.769" style="s2">think that&#39;s another thing I want too I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.029" end="00:43:17.559" style="s2">still don&#39;t I can&#39;t get my head around</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.769" end="00:43:22.390" style="s2">but I think I&#39;m approaching it from this</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.559" end="00:43:24.460" style="s2">kind of perspective of that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.390" end="00:43:26.049" style="s2">get your head around it tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.460" end="00:43:28.059" style="s2">you&#39;re actually starting to approach it</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.049" end="00:43:29.950" style="s2">right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.059" end="00:43:34.569" style="s2">is that why you chose because I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.950" end="00:43:37.720" style="s2">harder uses like hermeneutics or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.569" end="00:43:39.400" style="s2">SIRT it kind of is like an approach to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.720" end="00:43:42.369" style="s2">interpretation that we used by say</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.400" end="00:43:44.890" style="s2">church fathers and rabbis for the Talmud</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.369" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s like a we don&#39;t exactly want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.890" end="00:43:51.309" style="s2">say what it is because saying that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:53.049" style="s2">make it false or it would run away from</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.309" end="00:43:54.579" style="s2">us if we actually pointed the light at</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.049" end="00:43:56.680" style="s2">it we actually just want to go around it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.579" end="00:43:58.690" style="s2">look at it from different angles and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.680" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">then we&#39;ll get a better picture before</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.690" end="00:44:03.730" style="s2">going straight in you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">circling kind of concept that&#39;s how soon</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.730" end="00:44:07.960" style="s2">as you said it Arnie that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:09.400" style="s2">thought yeah I would say that I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.960" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">say that and it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.400" end="00:44:14.769" style="s2">through after circling after the fact I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:16.869" style="s2">realized that what we were doing was</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.769" end="00:44:20.609" style="s2">something like hermetic hermetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.869" end="00:44:23.500" style="s2">phenomenology mm-hmm but it was from</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.609" end="00:44:25.630" style="s2">wandering around and us getting together</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.500" end="00:44:27.220" style="s2">and looking and then standing back and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.630" end="00:44:28.810" style="s2">looking at it that then I started to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.220" end="00:44:30.250" style="s2">into Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.810" end="00:44:31.900" style="s2">all of a sudden they started to bring oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.250" end="00:44:34.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing and then I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.900" end="00:44:38.110" style="s2">realized that that in understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.660" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know that we understood back</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.110" end="00:44:42.520" style="s2">on itself creating a hole like a new</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:46.390" style="s2">hole if you will of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.520" end="00:44:49.300" style="s2">the medic phenomenology okay so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.390" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">like what I forgot that earlier was in</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.300" end="00:44:54.070" style="s2">terms of your contact with Heidegger did</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:55.570" style="s2">you did you come across him I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.070" end="00:44:58.540" style="s2">to say the word organically but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.570" end="00:45:00.580" style="s2">like maybe accidentally or or incidental</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.540" end="00:45:02.380" style="s2">to something you&#39;re interested in or was</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.580" end="00:45:06.280" style="s2">it like a formal kind of I want to read</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.380" end="00:45:08.680" style="s2">one of his books and see what answer</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.280" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">your question but I just hit me that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.680" end="00:45:12.130" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that when you forgot to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:15.670" style="s2">ask me about that I think that&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.130" end="00:45:19.050" style="s2">right in that it tells me that what</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.670" end="00:45:21.550" style="s2">we&#39;re following right is not some</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.050" end="00:45:23.230" style="s2">pre-scripted thing like the topic that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:28.500" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.230" end="00:45:35.860" style="s2">we were enacting the topic right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:37.180" style="s2">was circling like here so that because</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.860" end="00:45:39.130" style="s2">we weren&#39;t following the script we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.180" end="00:45:40.870" style="s2">following a movement right is his idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.130" end="00:45:43.480" style="s2">maybe would say following the movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.870" end="00:45:47.470" style="s2">to the showing yep yes but to answer</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.480" end="00:45:49.120" style="s2">your question I didn&#39;t so I graduate I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.560" end="00:46:00.310" style="s2">avant-garde like really obscure you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:04.810" style="s2">one of the most avant-garde art schools</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.310" end="00:46:06.460" style="s2">in the world young and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.810" end="00:46:09.220" style="s2">remember with the week we had like art</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.460" end="00:46:10.810" style="s2">school math was just this guy coming in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.220" end="00:46:11.980" style="s2">and talking about theoretical physics we</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.810" end="00:46:14.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t even look at a number so it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.980" end="00:46:17.380" style="s2">so not academic and in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.170" end="00:46:20.890" style="s2">sense right now yeah but somewhere along</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.380" end="00:46:23.530" style="s2">the way I can&#39;t exactly tell you how or</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.890" end="00:46:26.710" style="s2">why oh yeah I remember yeah my friend</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.510" end="00:46:42.520" style="s2">the influence of Fernando Flores Flores</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:44.500" style="s2">was a Haida garyun</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.520" end="00:46:46.180" style="s2">and so a lot of the language in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.500" end="00:46:48.700" style="s2">Landmark Forum which is okay you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.180" end="00:46:50.980" style="s2">say is like a like a a ontological</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.700" end="00:46:53.110" style="s2">education or a kind of a personal growth</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.820" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">the late 60s early 70s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:01.630" style="s2">some companies used it didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:05.650" style="s2">for team building and stuff like that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.630" end="00:47:07.090" style="s2">that right yeah influence on the culture</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.650" end="00:47:09.580" style="s2">in a way that it doesn&#39;t get really get</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.090" end="00:47:10.780" style="s2">accredited for yeah and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.580" end="00:47:13.830" style="s2">controversy about it we can go to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.780" end="00:47:16.870" style="s2">if you want but he had just taken it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.830" end="00:47:18.670" style="s2">he had he had gotten out of his</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.870" end="00:47:20.680" style="s2">curiosity had just gotten to the basic</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.670" end="00:47:22.210" style="s2">works of Heidegger and I saw it on this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.680" end="00:47:23.410" style="s2">table I&#39;m like what&#39;s that and like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.210" end="00:47:26.020" style="s2">started talking about a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.410" end="00:47:27.550" style="s2">Mike this is interesting and I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.020" end="00:47:29.350" style="s2">again just kind of get kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.550" end="00:47:33.970" style="s2">understand where I&#39;m coming from here is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.350" end="00:47:35.830" style="s2">I I&#39;m not like smart in the in any</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.970" end="00:47:39.970" style="s2">traditional sense of the word right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.830" end="00:47:41.170" style="s2">like I had reading disabilities I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.970" end="00:47:44.890" style="s2">couldn&#39;t learn how to read until I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.170" end="00:47:51.730" style="s2">like 11 or 12 mmm I you know I did</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.890" end="00:47:53.650" style="s2">dyslexia and I you know I came from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.730" end="00:47:56.110" style="s2">really really like kind of troubled</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.650" end="00:47:57.460" style="s2">background you know with my parents and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.110" end="00:47:59.470" style="s2">supply kit so I had like a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.460" end="00:48:04.930" style="s2">trauma I know all kinds it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.470" end="00:48:06.940" style="s2">and so when I was mrs. Bruch&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.930" end="00:48:08.380" style="s2">the my parent I got shipped from school</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.940" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">to school to school my educational</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.380" end="00:48:13.270" style="s2">background because no one couldn&#39;t teach</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:16.030" style="s2">me how to read yeah and then I got this</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.270" end="00:48:17.770" style="s2">amazing special ed teacher that would</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.030" end="00:48:21.370" style="s2">take me out of like a mainstream class</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.770" end="00:48:25.510" style="s2">for a couple of hours and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.370" end="00:48:29.290" style="s2">looking back on it I think what she did</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.510" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">is she somehow tricked me into using my</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.290" end="00:48:35.380" style="s2">right brain jury right yeah I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:36.850" style="s2">that&#39;s actually accurate but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.380" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">there&#39;s something about it that she</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.850" end="00:48:45.010" style="s2">somehow kind of like got how i cognized</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:46.690" style="s2">and and had me approach reading from</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.010" end="00:48:48.940" style="s2">that from that way what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.690" end="00:48:51.970" style="s2">about it is like I started to learn I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.940" end="00:48:55.420" style="s2">started to learn how to read um and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.970" end="00:48:56.099" style="s2">didn&#39;t notice it right right thank I</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.420" end="00:48:58.589" style="s2">didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.099" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2">until I just remember one day you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.589" end="00:49:02.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a Friday or something and you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.150" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">this big stack of graded papers right</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.039" end="00:49:05.759" style="s2">and I brought it home like every Friday</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">I put it on the table and my mom I</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.759" end="00:49:11.880" style="s2">remember going oh my god right like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:13.769" style="s2">I&#39;ve gotten something above a D and no</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.880" end="00:49:17.549" style="s2">papers and I just remember that I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.769" end="00:49:22.469" style="s2">like oh wow and I think that that that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.549" end="00:49:25.499" style="s2">think that was telling um when I looked</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.469" end="00:49:27.660" style="s2">at Heidegger what may have been one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.499" end="00:49:28.430" style="s2">the things that made me permeable to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.660" end="00:49:33.569" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.430" end="00:49:35.039" style="s2">and so basically I I started to you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.569" end="00:49:38.430" style="s2">I started looking at Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.039" end="00:49:41.339" style="s2">reading Heidegger and I had no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.430" end="00:49:44.069" style="s2">he was trying to talk about juin</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.339" end="00:49:47.759" style="s2">but my but I have to say though that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.069" end="00:49:51.239" style="s2">but it was but it was like I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.759" end="00:49:53.569" style="s2">understand okay what he was saying but</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.239" end="00:49:56.759" style="s2">it was the kind of not understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.569" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">that actually drew me deeper into it for</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.759" end="00:50:00.329" style="s2">some reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:02.160" style="s2">right okay pause here for a second just</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.329" end="00:50:04.680" style="s2">to make an observation I reckon you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.160" end="00:50:07.079" style="s2">would have been in a better position to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.680" end="00:50:09.269" style="s2">absorb and understand Heidegger and say</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.079" end="00:50:10.589" style="s2">a philosophy professor would be and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.269" end="00:50:12.329" style="s2">reason I say that is because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.589" end="00:50:14.489" style="s2">philosophy professor already has a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.329" end="00:50:16.949" style="s2">thousand preconceptions of say what</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.489" end="00:50:18.930" style="s2">being means and how you come to it that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.949" end="00:50:21.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just clouding his view of how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:23.039" style="s2">read Heidegger and Reagan was really a</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.239" end="00:50:25.199" style="s2">paradigm shift in the history of Western</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.039" end="00:50:28.410" style="s2">philosophy no one really disputes that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.199" end="00:50:31.469" style="s2">even if they hate him right so someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.410" end="00:50:34.380" style="s2">like you coming to that fresh I think is</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.469" end="00:50:38.130" style="s2">actually at an advantage ironically I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.380" end="00:50:40.229" style="s2">think so a theory I think so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.130" end="00:50:41.430" style="s2">think so and and this is where it starts</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.229" end="00:50:43.259" style="s2">to get into the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.430" end="00:50:45.569" style="s2">concealment and unconcealed MIT because</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.259" end="00:50:48.299" style="s2">that was concealed to me right like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.569" end="00:50:50.430" style="s2">categories and cuz I know if I was in</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.299" end="00:50:52.259" style="s2">school and they gave me Heidegger like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.430" end="00:50:53.640" style="s2">thought have read the same thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.259" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">would have not read it I would have put</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.640" end="00:50:59.279" style="s2">it off and like my test or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:00.660" style="s2">know yeah but Betty was alive for me and</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.279" end="00:51:02.609" style="s2">it was interesting because right at that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.660" end="00:51:04.769" style="s2">time it was right at the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.609" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">circling to at the same time now I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.769" end="00:51:08.609" style="s2">didn&#39;t draw I didn&#39;t draw the connection</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:09.930" style="s2">between the two until two or three years</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.609" end="00:51:14.609" style="s2">later that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.930" end="00:51:15.930" style="s2">was also compelling to me too but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.609" end="00:51:18.059" style="s2">and then I would just start to read it</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.930" end="00:51:19.349" style="s2">and I remember because I lived in North</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.059" end="00:51:21.030" style="s2">Beach in a North Beach</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.349" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">we had a Barnes and Nobles like a block</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.030" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">and a block away and I was a poor</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:28.109" style="s2">students right so so I get off school or</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">enough work and I&#39;d go to Barnes &amp; Noble</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.109" end="00:51:31.020" style="s2">and of course no one would ever buy the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:33.000" style="s2">Heidegger book so it was like my own</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.020" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">personal little like my degree I just</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.000" end="00:51:36.329" style="s2">take it off the shelf and I would just</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:39.150" style="s2">read it I didn&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.329" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">I read it and what was interesting is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.150" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">wasn&#39;t until about three years later</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">that all of a sudden I saw I saw one</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:52.349" style="s2">that I hadn&#39;t seen right but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">understood in some way but not and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.349" end="00:52:01.099" style="s2">in the over against way but in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:04.170" style="s2">bottom-up sense of the word that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.099" end="00:52:06.569" style="s2">circling reading Heidegger and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.170" end="00:52:11.400" style="s2">circling reading Heidegger and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.569" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">circling that motion um Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.400" end="00:52:15.869" style="s2">transformed my mind and because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:18.599" style="s2">transformed my mind it transformed what</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.869" end="00:52:21.780" style="s2">I saw and how I listened and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.599" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2">would look at a person I noticed that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.780" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">had noticed that where my attention</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.400" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">would go was not necessarily just on</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:33.869" style="s2">what the person was saying but what was</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:37.049" style="s2">so near to them what had to already be</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.869" end="00:52:40.980" style="s2">true in them in order to say what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.049" end="00:52:43.020" style="s2">were saying right now that motion is I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.980" end="00:52:44.400" style="s2">like that I was that I realized that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.020" end="00:52:46.740" style="s2">was like whoa wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:50.190" style="s2">like that&#39;s what Heidegger&#39;s doing right</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.740" end="00:52:51.930" style="s2">like I&#39;m going it&#39;s beyond analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.190" end="00:52:53.220" style="s2">motive side and saying well what&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.930" end="00:52:54.799" style="s2">agenda when he&#39;s saying that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.220" end="00:52:57.390" style="s2">actually like no forget</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.799" end="00:53:00.180" style="s2">you get the layer of argument and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.390" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">where that&#39;s coming from like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.180" end="00:53:07.010" style="s2">feelings of body language the I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:12.660" style="s2">composing himself or herself the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.010" end="00:53:15.780" style="s2">word here is is the horizons the rises</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.660" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">that like are necessarily concealed from</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.780" end="00:53:20.990" style="s2">the person&#39;s view that they said that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:23.710" style="s2">gives them the ground that they then</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.990" end="00:53:25.210" style="s2">stand on to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.710" end="00:53:27.220" style="s2">not just say the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.210" end="00:53:30.280" style="s2">saying but saying them in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.220" end="00:53:32.349" style="s2">they&#39;re saying including presupposing</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.280" end="00:53:35.650" style="s2">the listening that they&#39;re speaking into</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.349" end="00:53:38.530" style="s2">mmm all of that started to get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.650" end="00:53:40.810" style="s2">unconcealed from to me and I could say</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.530" end="00:53:42.700" style="s2">talk about that like when you look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.810" end="00:53:45.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like for example when people would</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.700" end="00:53:46.810" style="s2">would start to start to talk I said you</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.190" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">notice like that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.810" end="00:53:53.530" style="s2">explaining themselves as if as if</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:55.869" style="s2">they&#39;re as if they for example like as</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.530" end="00:53:57.910" style="s2">if somebody was interrogating them but</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.869" end="00:53:59.800" style="s2">nobody would be interrogating them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.910" end="00:54:02.560" style="s2">I&#39;d be like and I would notice that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.800" end="00:54:04.599" style="s2">right I&#39;d be like who you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.560" end="00:54:08.230" style="s2">mm-hmm I would do this thing where it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.599" end="00:54:10.210" style="s2">be like this in this look right this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.230" end="00:54:12.220" style="s2">that look and I&#39;ve seen that look a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.210" end="00:54:14.470" style="s2">couple of times in since we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.220" end="00:54:16.510" style="s2">talking like yeah right whoa</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.470" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">that moment of suspension yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.510" end="00:54:22.570" style="s2">background becomes foreground who was I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">talking to mmm and that would then lead</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.570" end="00:54:29.770" style="s2">to a completely different relational</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:31.420" style="s2">event right no like oh wow like who was</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.770" end="00:54:32.680" style="s2">I talking to it would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.420" end="00:54:35.170" style="s2">you know it would be something like oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.680" end="00:54:38.050" style="s2">my god my dad just interrogated me my</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.170" end="00:54:41.170" style="s2">whole life and so on some level I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.050" end="00:54:44.200" style="s2">been comporting the world as something</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.170" end="00:54:46.300" style="s2">like my dad and then trying to work that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.200" end="00:54:48.940" style="s2">thing out and trying to finally which of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.300" end="00:54:49.990" style="s2">course gives him a particular quality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.940" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">eye mmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.990" end="00:54:54.220" style="s2">we&#39;d go when we say like who was I</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.690" end="00:54:57.160" style="s2">talking to in that moment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.220" end="00:54:59.500" style="s2">stepping back their horizon you said you</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.160" end="00:55:02.200" style="s2">now have a new horizon he&#39;s a what was</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.500" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">horizon right becomes foreground and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.200" end="00:55:07.450" style="s2">then we have a dialogue about that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:10.150" style="s2">but then that starts to then I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.450" end="00:55:13.150" style="s2">start to notice things like what is that</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.150" end="00:55:15.730" style="s2">what you&#39;re speaking from now yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.150" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">yeah and that mirror is something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.730" end="00:55:24.099" style="s2">Keegan who is a who&#39;s based in Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:27.970" style="s2">right would say that how psychological</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.099" end="00:55:31.960" style="s2">or moral development happens which is I</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.970" end="00:55:35.530" style="s2">see with the level of development right</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.960" end="00:55:37.390" style="s2">I see I don&#39;t see it right so the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.530" end="00:55:40.539" style="s2">meaning that I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.390" end="00:55:42.220" style="s2">is given by the like the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.539" end="00:55:45.609" style="s2">development that I&#39;m that I&#39;m in and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.220" end="00:55:48.369" style="s2">then developing to the next frame is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.609" end="00:55:50.789" style="s2">where I pop out to a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.369" end="00:55:54.249" style="s2">organization and then I see the level</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.789" end="00:55:55.630" style="s2">subject goes object and then the process</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.249" end="00:55:58.059" style="s2">of evolving to the next level is this</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.630" end="00:56:00.579" style="s2">where then I look at this new level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.059" end="00:56:03.160" style="s2">meaning that I used to see with and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.579" end="00:56:05.380" style="s2">I begin to I begin to comport it or</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.160" end="00:56:08.049" style="s2">translate it into this higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.380" end="00:56:10.509" style="s2">complexity and at a certain culminating</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.049" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">point I then I pop out and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.509" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">psychological development right that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:15.970" style="s2">abstract thing out and in applying those</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:18.999" style="s2">abstractions back to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.970" end="00:56:20.980" style="s2">extract it out mmm creates more</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.999" end="00:56:25.749" style="s2">complexity and the thing is in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.980" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">process you&#39;d see all those horizons you</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.749" end="00:56:31.749" style="s2">each still see them don&#39;t get evaporated</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:33.700" style="s2">once you&#39;ll have become objectified you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.749" end="00:56:37.059" style="s2">actually now have them at your disposal</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.700" end="00:56:40.410" style="s2">to make meaning and therefore develop</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.059" end="00:56:43.089" style="s2">which right act appears and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.410" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">citing Dostoyevsky you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.089" end="00:56:49.809" style="s2">yourself out you know work out what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:51.220" style="s2">your soul and and the conflict in your</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.809" end="00:56:53.739" style="s2">soul and the things you&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.220" end="00:56:56.349" style="s2">that are motivating influencing</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.739" end="00:56:58.019" style="s2">effecting holding you back and then once</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.349" end="00:57:01.239" style="s2">you go like I like your analogy about</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.019" end="00:57:02.769" style="s2">your you&#39;re in front of the horizon or</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.239" end="00:57:05.319" style="s2">whatever and then it suddenly becomes</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.769" end="00:57:08.829" style="s2">you&#39;re above it or whatever and you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.319" end="00:57:10.390" style="s2">see it for the first time as something</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.829" end="00:57:12.940" style="s2">that&#39;s part of your being that say</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.390" end="00:57:17.009" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a parent influencing how</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.940" end="00:57:20.200" style="s2">you speak so it seems like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.009" end="00:57:22.119" style="s2">immaterial or it seems a bit miniscule</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.200" end="00:57:24.549" style="s2">in terms of someone&#39;s whole life but</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.119" end="00:57:27.249" style="s2">it&#39;s like no that is that&#39;s there with</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.549" end="00:57:30.130" style="s2">you forever until you notice it until</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.249" end="00:57:31.599" style="s2">you can objectify and say okay right</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.130" end="00:57:35.049" style="s2">well so what am I going to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.599" end="00:57:37.779" style="s2">and how do I change my component of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.049" end="00:57:39.579" style="s2">by attunement to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.779" end="00:57:41.230" style="s2">based on what I know now which is I</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.579" end="00:57:42.999" style="s2">think kind of critical to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.230" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">self-development and it&#39;s like something</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.999" end="00:57:47.410" style="s2">so rare nowadays because people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:49.239" style="s2">think in that that mode of being you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.410" end="00:57:50.080" style="s2">know like what is part of my being how</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.239" end="00:57:52.600" style="s2">can I</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.080" end="00:57:55.210" style="s2">sort them out and order them so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.600" end="00:57:59.080" style="s2">so I&#39;m not kind of like just in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.210" end="00:58:01.990" style="s2">muck of you know your tunnel vision is</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.080" end="00:58:04.120" style="s2">the best way to put it yeah totally and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.990" end="00:58:05.770" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because this is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.120" end="00:58:07.630" style="s2">gets that uncle I&#39;ll go back to like</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.770" end="00:58:13.900" style="s2">kind of my grappling way really</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.630" end="00:58:16.270" style="s2">grappling with Heidegger so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.900" end="00:58:19.810" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling like I feel lit up right</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.270" end="00:58:21.490" style="s2">like this I feel kind of goosebumps or</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.810" end="00:58:24.250" style="s2">something and I think part of why I feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.490" end="00:58:26.890" style="s2">the goosebumps is because all of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.250" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">sudden were impacted by what I said he</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.890" end="00:58:31.870" style="s2">went like this and it was almost like I</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:34.420" style="s2">felt like something a new meaning was</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.870" end="00:58:37.120" style="s2">emerging in your listening right you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.420" end="00:58:40.470" style="s2">ready to get something and in this</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.120" end="00:58:42.970" style="s2">certain way I started to listen right -</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.470" end="00:58:45.430" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to grapple with what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.970" end="00:58:47.170" style="s2">said and in some way I was watching I</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.430" end="00:58:48.970" style="s2">was registering some kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.170" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">happening in you and it registered over</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.970" end="00:58:53.130" style="s2">here is goosebumps well you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:55.180" style="s2">high daguerreian explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.130" end="00:58:58.930" style="s2">psychological and personally</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.180" end="00:59:01.060" style="s2">developmental you know studies that PJ</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.800" end="00:59:10.300" style="s2">that theory and then the analogy you</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.620" end="00:59:13.900" style="s2">brought up with hiding it was actually I</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.300" end="00:59:16.450" style="s2">now visually see the truth of it like</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.900" end="00:59:18.520" style="s2">there&#39;s just in my mind that when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.450" end="00:59:20.350" style="s2">what you were doing I was like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.520" end="00:59:22.780" style="s2">no real disputing in my mind that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.350" end="00:59:23.800" style="s2">is truth to some extent doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.780" end="00:59:26.200" style="s2">how you explain it you could have</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.800" end="00:59:32.260" style="s2">explained a different way but it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.200" end="00:59:34.690" style="s2">still true that&#39;s what it was it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.260" end="00:59:36.850" style="s2">that is it&#39;s like it just can was</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.690" end="00:59:39.660" style="s2">concealed before it unconsumed itself</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.850" end="00:59:42.580" style="s2">through talking and visual imagery and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.660" end="00:59:44.020" style="s2">for me you know I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.580" end="00:59:46.210" style="s2">I&#39;ll use it or not but it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.020" end="00:59:49.240" style="s2">tool that would help me anyway</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.210" end="00:59:50.620" style="s2">personally down the road if I ever have</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.240" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">a problem like that it&#39;s like why am i</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.620" end="00:59:55.840" style="s2">doing this particular thing in my life</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:57.910" style="s2">and you can kind of step back and view</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.840" end="01:00:00.670" style="s2">it as like a series of horizons that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.910" end="01:00:03.790" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily dissolve once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.670" end="01:00:05.850" style="s2">once once you hit on them but</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.790" end="01:00:09.400" style="s2">actually there for you to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.850" end="01:00:10.750" style="s2">and kind of work out sort out whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.400" end="01:00:13.240" style="s2">you want to call it and that for me is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.750" end="01:00:14.760" style="s2">like that&#39;s why the to kind of meld at</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.240" end="01:00:17.560" style="s2">that point where you just said I thought</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.760" end="01:00:20.070" style="s2">okay now it was like that all the time I</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.560" end="01:00:22.930" style="s2">just don&#39;t really have that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.070" end="01:00:25.240" style="s2">it kind of like is it kind of like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.930" end="01:00:29.560" style="s2">knew you knew about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.240" end="01:00:32.980" style="s2">paj and he knew about that you use the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.560" end="01:00:35.080" style="s2">word that right and in understanding or</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.980" end="01:00:39.010" style="s2">in eliciting is it fair to say that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.080" end="01:00:41.530" style="s2">became this you knew about this we was</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.010" end="01:00:43.000" style="s2">much closer yeah yeah yeah I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.530" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">know what I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.000" end="01:00:49.870" style="s2">been compelled by that that experience</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:53.290" style="s2">of what I say that is right versus this</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.870" end="01:00:57.640" style="s2">is a very different experience right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.290" end="01:01:03.010" style="s2">I think I think what what I say when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.640" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">say that that that is a lamp when versus</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.010" end="01:01:11.380" style="s2">when I say this is a lamp the the is in</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:14.080" style="s2">that is kind of already worked out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.380" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">over there but when I say this that</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.080" end="01:01:19.360" style="s2">points to is it&#39;s already worked out at</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:21.610" style="s2">advanced right when I say this I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.360" end="01:01:23.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m pointing to is the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.610" end="01:01:28.150" style="s2">between the two and I think this has</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.710" end="01:01:28.810" style="s2">more of a care element as opposing about</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.150" end="01:01:31.650" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.810" end="01:01:34.810" style="s2">if someone says a command to you like</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.650" end="01:01:36.490" style="s2">did guy I&#39;d like you to talk to someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.810" end="01:01:37.900" style="s2">so if you could do that for me as soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.490" end="01:01:40.570" style="s2">as possible would be great right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.900" end="01:01:42.070" style="s2">very formal through that for me if</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.570" end="01:01:44.440" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to someone usually what</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.070" end="01:01:47.980" style="s2">you say is it&#39;d be really great if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.440" end="01:01:50.890" style="s2">do this for me because it means a lot or</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.980" end="01:01:53.650" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just so much closer</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.890" end="01:01:57.970" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.650" end="01:02:02.920" style="s2">relations with someone else then that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.970" end="01:02:05.650" style="s2">a it has a specific way you place</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.920" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">yourself to an object you know what I</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.650" end="01:02:13.320" style="s2">mean like when you when you say I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:16.330" style="s2">you to do that it&#39;s somehow further away</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.320" end="01:02:17.470" style="s2">you know from what you actually care</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.330" end="01:02:20.560" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.470" end="01:02:22.900" style="s2">it&#39;s better if you could do this for me</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.560" end="01:02:24.790" style="s2">you like naturally the rhythm of</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.900" end="01:02:26.800" style="s2">language you expect to hear I would</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.790" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">really appreciate it all that would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.800" end="01:02:30.490" style="s2">really great well that would be really</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:33.160" style="s2">like this it means more on enough that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.490" end="01:02:35.800" style="s2">kind of like I can use the word care</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.160" end="01:02:37.330" style="s2">again yeah yeah about it right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.800" end="01:02:40.270" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality of like that and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.330" end="01:02:41.590" style="s2">think that starts to point to and I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.270" end="01:02:46.119" style="s2">to start to see if we can kind of start</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.590" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">to uncover that a bit of when I when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.119" end="01:02:51.040" style="s2">use the word care and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.119" end="01:02:53.590" style="s2">existential question right we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.040" end="01:02:56.680" style="s2">gonna say what is care but when you say</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.590" end="01:02:58.630" style="s2">care what do you mean right then would</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.680" end="01:03:01.750" style="s2">you that&#39;s a very different question I</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.630" end="01:03:04.210" style="s2">say what is care versus what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.750" end="01:03:06.190" style="s2">when you say care then we said that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.210" end="01:03:08.710" style="s2">starts to we start to move into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.190" end="01:03:11.859" style="s2">background right great mister to like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.710" end="01:03:17.230" style="s2">start to unconcealed what was concealed</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.859" end="01:03:19.150" style="s2">or as I think Peterson points out so</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.230" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">well like all the way through biology</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.150" end="01:03:27.970" style="s2">all the way up into consciousness in</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:30.250" style="s2">that he would say that when in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.970" end="01:03:32.470" style="s2">mythological enactment of the stories in</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.250" end="01:03:34.869" style="s2">a ritual it wasn&#39;t like it was like an</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.470" end="01:03:38.470" style="s2">embodied cognition right it was embodied</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.869" end="01:03:40.170" style="s2">they lived the knowledge right they</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.470" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">didn&#39;t know about it they had not</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.170" end="01:03:45.490" style="s2">extracted out something like mythology</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:47.380" style="s2">they lived in myth and they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.490" end="01:03:50.619" style="s2">explain to you the rules of the games</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.380" end="01:03:51.970" style="s2">that they were doing a higher level of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.619" end="01:03:56.800" style="s2">development when they were able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.970" end="01:04:00.820" style="s2">abstract it out and go that ready that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.800" end="01:04:02.980" style="s2">that abstracting out right and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.820" end="01:04:05.830" style="s2">applying that abstraction back to it</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.980" end="01:04:11.290" style="s2">right starts to create new categories of</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.830" end="01:04:15.250" style="s2">understanding and that&#39;s very much was</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.290" end="01:04:18.099" style="s2">my experience of realizing that so much</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.250" end="01:04:21.760" style="s2">of how I learned what circling and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.099" end="01:04:24.130" style="s2">continued learner circling is was how</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.760" end="01:04:27.220" style="s2">and how much it had to do with Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.130" end="01:04:29.589" style="s2">yeah so what what I realized years later</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.220" end="01:04:31.299" style="s2">is what I look back I was like oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.589" end="01:04:36.609" style="s2">like the terminology that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.299" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">like dating someone world right um elite</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.609" end="01:04:40.479" style="s2">the word ilithyia we would use that word</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:43.419" style="s2">a lot unconcealed it right</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.479" end="01:04:45.669" style="s2">unveiling horizon all those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.419" end="01:04:48.999" style="s2">things I was like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.669" end="01:04:52.029" style="s2">wait in it like this is all this is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.999" end="01:04:55.269" style="s2">I was like oh my god it was this reading</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.029" end="01:04:56.709" style="s2">Heidegger and then and then relating to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.269" end="01:04:58.359" style="s2">something in the world reading Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.709" end="01:05:00.579" style="s2">and relating to the world needed</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.359" end="01:05:02.890" style="s2">transform my mind and I think what and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.579" end="01:05:06.399" style="s2">this is the point divider it&#39;s is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.890" end="01:05:08.140" style="s2">not he&#39;s not trying to get you to - not</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.399" end="01:05:10.269" style="s2">trying to get he&#39;s not trying to inform</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.140" end="01:05:13.809" style="s2">you of anything right he&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.269" end="01:05:16.630" style="s2">saying walk along the path of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.809" end="01:05:19.569" style="s2">and let&#39;s see if we can discover that</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.630" end="01:05:21.849" style="s2">which is worthy of thought which is two</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.569" end="01:05:23.380" style="s2">things it&#39;s like that which is worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.849" end="01:05:26.589" style="s2">thought is that we have yet begun</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.380" end="01:05:29.739" style="s2">thinking and that which is worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.589" end="01:05:31.929" style="s2">thought is is is that thinking is in</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.739" end="01:05:34.419" style="s2">fact happening right what is thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.929" end="01:05:36.369" style="s2">right as we&#39;re thinking right that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.419" end="01:05:39.009" style="s2">covering it&#39;s a disclosure it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.369" end="01:05:40.989" style="s2">going into the chaos or you know like</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.009" end="01:05:43.779" style="s2">knitting into the like I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.989" end="01:05:45.789" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t know and and grappling</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.779" end="01:05:47.199" style="s2">with and this is what what Petersen</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.789" end="01:05:49.899" style="s2">talks about like we have one foot in</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.199" end="01:05:52.599" style="s2">chaos we have one in one foot in order</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.899" end="01:05:55.209" style="s2">and we find that like sweet spot and in</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.599" end="01:05:57.159" style="s2">those moments is living meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.209" end="01:06:00.459" style="s2">those are the moments in those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.159" end="01:06:02.529" style="s2">flow states right where where we it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.459" end="01:06:04.659" style="s2">not a doubt at all whether or not all</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.529" end="01:06:05.259" style="s2">the pain and suffering that is life was</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.659" end="01:06:08.380" style="s2">worth it</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.259" end="01:06:11.199" style="s2">like right in those moments yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.380" end="01:06:12.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s like when it&#39;s a cliche but</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.199" end="01:06:13.089" style="s2">when you say time flies when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.549" end="01:06:15.249" style="s2">having fun</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.089" end="01:06:17.529" style="s2">think about that in the in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.249" end="01:06:21.159" style="s2">standing in that chaos and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.529" end="01:06:27.880" style="s2">interface and just like being in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.159" end="01:06:30.189" style="s2">moment time doesn&#39;t exist yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.880" end="01:06:33.309" style="s2">reality right begins that you lived</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.189" end="01:06:36.939" style="s2">right yeah and that&#39;s another color if</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.309" end="01:06:38.229" style="s2">you will the time aspect of this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.939" end="01:06:39.519" style="s2">something we haven&#39;t gone into because</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.229" end="01:06:41.380" style="s2">Holly is fast</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.519" end="01:06:43.749" style="s2">work is being in time we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.380" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">about being for most of this but time is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.749" end="01:06:46.740" style="s2">something that is very</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:49.619" style="s2">much just like language a limiting</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.740" end="01:06:53.250" style="s2">factor to understanding these truths I</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.619" end="01:06:54.720" style="s2">think anyway and like I&#39;d be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.250" end="01:06:58.400" style="s2">at your thoughts but just going back to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.720" end="01:07:00.869" style="s2">this care kind of thing it strikes me is</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.400" end="01:07:03.750" style="s2">also from being in time when Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.869" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">talks like the similarities between when</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.750" end="01:07:10.289" style="s2">hiding it talks about most human beings</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:12.779" style="s2">that they as in the mass of people that</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.289" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">we consider human beings in society and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.779" end="01:07:17.339" style="s2">all these abstract nouns those people in</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:19.740" style="s2">their everyday lives</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.339" end="01:07:22.980" style="s2">turn away from questions like what does</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.740" end="01:07:25.140" style="s2">it mean to have being what does it mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.980" end="01:07:28.680" style="s2">to live in the world what is existence</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.140" end="01:07:31.049" style="s2">how does this change or modify my</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.680" end="01:07:33.839" style="s2">behavior in my life to make the most out</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.049" end="01:07:36.089" style="s2">of you know being and be in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.839" end="01:07:38.490" style="s2">other people in a more primordial way</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.089" end="01:07:44.400" style="s2">all these kind of outcomes we turn away</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.490" end="01:07:48.690" style="s2">from them because you&#39;d rather go and do</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.400" end="01:07:52.349" style="s2">a job and get money or watch TV or you</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.690" end="01:07:55.950" style="s2">know we prefer to stay in the order area</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.349" end="01:07:58.410" style="s2">of that yin and yang then cross that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.950" end="01:08:01.259" style="s2">interface and go into stuff we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.410" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">know or worried about knowing you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.259" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">things that we are scared might actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">change how we act or how we live if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:12.509" style="s2">find out about them and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:14.519" style="s2">so true that Heidegger that&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.509" end="01:08:17.549" style="s2">like when I read that I thought that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.519" end="01:08:20.009" style="s2">more kind of like what I&#39;d expect to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.549" end="01:08:21.719" style="s2">hear a novelist right yes someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.009" end="01:08:24.359" style="s2">running a formal philosophical book</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.719" end="01:08:26.850" style="s2">about you know concepts on being in</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.359" end="01:08:28.770" style="s2">existence I thought that he just hit the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.850" end="01:08:30.870" style="s2">nail on the head there and we always</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.770" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">know it because we act like that like I</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.870" end="01:08:35.549" style="s2">act like that mother just gets stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:37.859" style="s2">the office and do my work and head down</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.549" end="01:08:41.250" style="s2">and you know do that if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.859" end="01:08:44.310" style="s2">problem on the horizon about my future</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.250" end="01:08:46.920" style="s2">or questioning how I&#39;ve been acting</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.310" end="01:08:50.639" style="s2">ethics moral all that it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.920" end="01:08:54.179" style="s2">turn my back to it and then yeah at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.639" end="01:08:55.170" style="s2">same time is the turning back right</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.179" end="01:08:56.730" style="s2">you&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.170" end="01:08:58.259" style="s2">that thing about just get this thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.730" end="01:09:00.690" style="s2">done you know high degree would say is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.259" end="01:09:02.069" style="s2">that&#39;s the motive and authenticity right</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.690" end="01:09:07.049" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s run yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.069" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">those deeper that deeper horizon right</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.049" end="01:09:11.790" style="s2">you&#39;ll say the ethical conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:14.460" style="s2">right um rather than dealing with that</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.790" end="01:09:16.500" style="s2">I&#39;m like doing this I&#39;m still given by</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.460" end="01:09:19.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s still given by my existence</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.500" end="01:09:22.920" style="s2">it&#39;s still given by that on some level I</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.440" end="01:09:24.420" style="s2">am care mm-hmm that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.920" end="01:09:26.220" style="s2">about like when you get any deeper</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.420" end="01:09:28.020" style="s2">questions it&#39;s like for example if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.220" end="01:09:31.650" style="s2">ask ourselves like you know what do I</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.020" end="01:09:34.259" style="s2">mean when I say care or even if I ask</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.650" end="01:09:37.560" style="s2">the question of what is care the thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.259" end="01:09:40.710" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting what I&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.560" end="01:09:43.830" style="s2">asking that question is I&#39;m caring right</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.710" end="01:09:46.410" style="s2">it presupposes that I&#39;m in care I live</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.830" end="01:09:48.960" style="s2">it in care it&#39;s not a sitz I&#39;m not an</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.410" end="01:09:51.540" style="s2">like a subject that is subjective I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.960" end="01:09:54.540" style="s2">not a being about stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.540" end="01:09:57.540" style="s2">I am a being that cares right and care</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.540" end="01:09:59.880" style="s2">is like this whole that you&#39;re either in</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.540" end="01:10:01.980" style="s2">or you&#39;re not in like it&#39;s if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.880" end="01:10:05.460" style="s2">care your ink it&#39;s not like so much a</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.980" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">spectrum where I kind of care but you</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.460" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s like you are it&#39;s something or</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:13.410" style="s2">the other you can&#39;t be weak Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:16.140" style="s2">who would say is that like care isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.410" end="01:10:19.950" style="s2">attribute that you express it&#39;s a moment</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.140" end="01:10:22.290" style="s2">of being something your being is a care</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.950" end="01:10:23.700" style="s2">cause you know like this is here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.290" end="01:10:28.040" style="s2">good way of kind of getting at it you</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.700" end="01:10:33.239" style="s2">could say that the earth birds nature</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.040" end="01:10:37.700" style="s2">nature birds people people bird worlds</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.239" end="01:10:42.060" style="s2">hmm yeah like the earth Birds nature</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.700" end="01:10:44.670" style="s2">nature birth people people birth worlds</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.060" end="01:10:48.390" style="s2">yeah right if we say well what is it to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.670" end="01:10:50.190" style="s2">world right you know I think Dawkins and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.390" end="01:10:55.500" style="s2">those kinds of people when they say that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.190" end="01:10:57.960" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m an ape that thinks right we</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.500" end="01:11:00.780" style="s2">have an environment no we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.960" end="01:11:03.810" style="s2">environments right like we have a world</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.780" end="01:11:07.739" style="s2">right you could say is Cory Anton would</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.810" end="01:11:09.930" style="s2">say that that we decompress Earth in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.739" end="01:11:11.590" style="s2">world right that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.930" end="01:11:15.070" style="s2">the way that we care</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.590" end="01:11:17.860" style="s2">that airing notices some things and</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.070" end="01:11:20.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t notice other things and in in</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.860" end="01:11:24.070" style="s2">the horizon or the limitation of my</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.890" end="01:11:27.310" style="s2">caring like when I bring the limits of</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.070" end="01:11:30.250" style="s2">that horizon it creates a ground that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.310" end="01:11:33.310" style="s2">a world of concern right in my whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.250" end="01:11:37.510" style="s2">life is I can&#39;t make a single motion</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.310" end="01:11:40.660" style="s2">that isn&#39;t given by care yeah that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.510" end="01:11:42.090" style="s2">it&#39;s is that like our world like you</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.660" end="01:11:44.920" style="s2">know as I like to say it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.090" end="01:11:46.870" style="s2">Instagram holo stuff like like gating</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.920" end="01:11:50.350" style="s2">your world what does that mean really</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.870" end="01:11:51.700" style="s2">mmm your world it&#39;s like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.350" end="01:11:53.800" style="s2">in order to get your world I have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.700" end="01:11:57.070" style="s2">start to care about what you care about</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.800" end="01:12:01.030" style="s2">that then articulate what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.070" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">you&#39;re already standing inside of that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.030" end="01:12:04.870" style="s2">then has you has your attention notice</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:07.630" style="s2">what it notices and not notice what it</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.870" end="01:12:09.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t notice executive these deeper</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.630" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">levels of the being of your being right</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.370" end="01:12:15.630" style="s2">which is synonymous with care and just</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:18.760" style="s2">to add to that I think that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.630" end="01:12:22.510" style="s2">again the very lucid image you just put</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.760" end="01:12:27.100" style="s2">out of earth nature people world that</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.510" end="01:12:29.830" style="s2">for me is like when Peterson talks about</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.100" end="01:12:32.110" style="s2">Hell right and I remember in the Joe</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.830" end="01:12:33.880" style="s2">Rogan podcast he talks about some brings</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.110" end="01:12:35.800" style="s2">up the Joe Rogan Briggs a ball the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.880" end="01:12:37.150" style="s2">apocalypse is already around us you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.800" end="01:12:39.400" style="s2">you just go to Africa or somewhere and</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.150" end="01:12:42.490" style="s2">then join Peterson so well yeah like go</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.400" end="01:12:44.230" style="s2">to skid row and you can see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.490" end="01:12:47.350" style="s2">not just a physical place in LA or</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.230" end="01:12:50.620" style="s2">whatever Skid Row&#39;s like hell it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.350" end="01:12:54.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a psychological environment just as</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.620" end="01:12:57.520" style="s2">much as a physical environmental and</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.310" end="01:13:01.300" style="s2">kind of area in the world it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.520" end="01:13:03.550" style="s2">also mental like it&#39;s human created and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.300" end="01:13:06.250" style="s2">that struck me is very high daguerreian</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.550" end="01:13:08.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s so true it&#39;s like well sure</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.250" end="01:13:10.570" style="s2">like a atheist scientific kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.590" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">materialist would say oh no no it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.570" end="01:13:14.290" style="s2">we defined by environment and poverty</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:17.850" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like well no poverty can</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.290" end="01:13:20.890" style="s2">be a state of mind it can be a an</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.850" end="01:13:21.810" style="s2">environment in and of itself if that</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.890" end="01:13:25.690" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.810" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">and the world is amalgam of</p>

<p begin="01:13:44.110" end="01:13:48.340" style="s2">limited geographically but we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:13:51.430" end="01:13:57.960" style="s2">so human beings have transcended that</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.680" end="01:14:02.010" style="s2">order of like you said existence from</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.960" end="01:14:05.980" style="s2">nature people and now we&#39;ve created this</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.010" end="01:14:09.400" style="s2">set of horizons where each individual is</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.980" end="01:14:11.110" style="s2">free to either overcome them and become</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.400" end="01:14:12.640" style="s2">more transcendental which I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.110" end="01:14:14.860" style="s2">transcendentalism is really just getting</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.640" end="01:14:16.750" style="s2">to the ultimate horizon that&#39;s for me</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.860" end="01:14:19.090" style="s2">what I would define as transcendental is</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.750" end="01:14:20.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t try to get into this spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.090" end="01:14:23.290" style="s2">god-like kind of conception because that</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.980" end="01:14:25.270" style="s2">just confuses it I think what to use</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.290" end="01:14:29.110" style="s2">your analogy it&#39;s basically just getting</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.270" end="01:14:31.630" style="s2">back enough to be able to see the range</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.110" end="01:14:33.850" style="s2">and scope and Verizon&#39;s that are in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.630" end="01:14:36.760" style="s2">world and that you can that&#39;s wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.850" end="01:14:41.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not like scientific wisdom or like</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.760" end="01:14:45.460" style="s2">IQ wisdom I think because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.380" end="01:14:48.940" style="s2">knowing about something right it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.460" end="01:14:50.730" style="s2">place wit it&#39;s when where who why you</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.940" end="01:14:53.170" style="s2">know it&#39;s everything it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.730" end="01:14:57.699" style="s2">understand here&#39;s wisdom and the act of</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.170" end="01:15:01.449" style="s2">understanding right I the being of my</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.699" end="01:15:03.640" style="s2">being is transformed that when I know in</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.449" end="01:15:05.739" style="s2">such a way that any act of knowing or</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.640" end="01:15:07.390" style="s2">understanding that I am different after</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.739" end="01:15:09.820" style="s2">that understanding now I&#39;m in acting</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.390" end="01:15:12.010" style="s2">Houston right yeah yeah that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.820" end="01:15:13.210" style="s2">you know Socrates is like he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.010" end="01:15:15.100" style="s2">I think he was the first coach</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.210" end="01:15:18.190" style="s2">essentially great because he waiting</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.100" end="01:15:19.630" style="s2">with people not he wasn&#39;t informing</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.190" end="01:15:22.660" style="s2">people people didn&#39;t walk away more</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.630" end="01:15:26.170" style="s2">inform make to a transformed dancer</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.660" end="01:15:28.330" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t handing add takes books um but</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.170" end="01:15:30.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great example as well as</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.330" end="01:15:32.469" style="s2">gonna bring up Aristotle who was lighter</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.670" end="01:15:36.310" style="s2">than Socrates but definitely influenced</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.469" end="01:15:39.250" style="s2">by him said that the key form of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.310" end="01:15:42.010" style="s2">was everything else hangs off of</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.250" end="01:15:45.790" style="s2">like Sophia wisdom in the sense you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.010" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">you have knowledge there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.790" end="01:15:50.860" style="s2">more primal than that which idea talks</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:53.770" style="s2">about and he called it Fran Asus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.860" end="01:15:58.420" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s term which is knowing how to</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.770" end="01:16:02.890" style="s2">act when to act why you&#39;re acting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.420" end="01:16:07.270" style="s2">like it&#39;s the crossroads of all those</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.890" end="01:16:10.530" style="s2">kind of dimensions of knowledge that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.270" end="01:16:12.850" style="s2">at the basis of it and I think if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.530" end="01:16:15.460" style="s2">miraculously try to bring it to this</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.850" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">concept of like world and horizons which</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.460" end="01:16:22.030" style="s2">I think you can but um you tell me how</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:26.410" style="s2">valid this connection is knowledge when</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.030" end="01:16:28.540" style="s2">you transcend earth nature people and</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.410" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">then you start looking at the world as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.540" end="01:16:34.360" style="s2">set of horizons that and you go through</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:37.450" style="s2">the back you know that&#39;s essentially for</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.360" end="01:16:39.250" style="s2">an ASUS in the Aristotelian sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.450" end="01:16:42.100" style="s2">more horizons you know the more</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.250" end="01:16:44.770" style="s2">knowledge of time timing when to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.100" end="01:16:49.900" style="s2">something when to speak the truth when</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.770" end="01:16:53.560" style="s2">not to you know when to you know be seen</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.900" end="01:16:55.390" style="s2">and we&#39;re not to when to why and why</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.560" end="01:16:57.520" style="s2">you&#39;re doing that you know it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.390" end="01:17:01.900" style="s2">combination that really gives people we</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.520" end="01:17:05.350" style="s2">can&#39;t read that in a textbook I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.900" end="01:17:07.990" style="s2">we say a textbook to explain that like a</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.350" end="01:17:10.810" style="s2">concept but if we say a textbook in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.990" end="01:17:13.810" style="s2">way that harberger like would write</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.810" end="01:17:17.100" style="s2">which is we&#39;re gonna go down a path and</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.810" end="01:17:21.190" style="s2">in the path great of essentially</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.100" end="01:17:23.260" style="s2">speaking and then noticing what gave the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.190" end="01:17:24.520" style="s2">movement of that thought going to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.260" end="01:17:26.230" style="s2">background bringing you in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.520" end="01:17:28.750" style="s2">foreground in a new level of a</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.230" end="01:17:31.840" style="s2">background that that when and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.750" end="01:17:35.350" style="s2">timing ray is is this is where</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.840" end="01:17:37.420" style="s2">temporalities in care right or you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.350" end="01:17:39.250" style="s2">separate them apart and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.420" end="01:17:41.550" style="s2">I would say about temporality and and to</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.250" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">make it cuz it man by getting into time</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.550" end="01:17:45.940" style="s2">Jesus you&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:48.370" style="s2">something that&#39;s like so at the edge of</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.940" end="01:17:50.790" style="s2">our it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s like be right</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.370" end="01:17:52.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like being in time I mean because</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.790" end="01:17:54.360" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to grapple that one out</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.200" end="01:17:56.250" style="s2">right being in time was a grappling or</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.360" end="01:17:59.880" style="s2">trying to work that out it was it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.250" end="01:18:01.770" style="s2">like your duck dusk EST right it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.880" end="01:18:03.690" style="s2">like he just basically took these these</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.770" end="01:18:05.460" style="s2">core presuppositions and he wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.690" end="01:18:08.280" style="s2">novel to see what would happen</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.460" end="01:18:10.200" style="s2">yeah right and you could you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.280" end="01:18:12.270" style="s2">imagine that the in writing those novels</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.200" end="01:18:14.610" style="s2">that that the it was a different author</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.270" end="01:18:17.190" style="s2">by the end of that novel than the one</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.610" end="01:18:20.250" style="s2">that started it mmm but that&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.190" end="01:18:21.960" style="s2">understanding of that&#39;s a deep like to</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.250" end="01:18:24.210" style="s2">go to think about what it takes to write</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.960" end="01:18:26.730" style="s2">a novel like that right like and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.210" end="01:18:29.280" style="s2">also Dostoevsky he&#39;s going into the mind</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.730" end="01:18:31.320" style="s2">that when tried to grope being in time</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.280" end="01:18:32.910" style="s2">it was a very ambitious title that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.320" end="01:18:34.800" style="s2">keep not even he could finish that book</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.910" end="01:18:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge amounts of the time</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:38.700" style="s2">section that he just never got around to</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.480" end="01:18:40.710" style="s2">Ronix he thought I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.700" end="01:18:45.180" style="s2">understand it dry it so if he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.710" end="01:18:46.950" style="s2">I&#39;m in over my head I need I have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.180" end="01:18:49.020" style="s2">write poetry to get at this one exactly</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.950" end="01:18:51.510" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s Tony Lipsky I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.020" end="01:18:54.450" style="s2">Ernie realized that and he&#39;d go down</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.510" end="01:18:57.960" style="s2">this very narrow passes you know crime</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.450" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">punishment morality justice God well how</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.960" end="01:19:03.840" style="s2">do these intertwine in my society like</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:06.660" style="s2">in the sense of Russian history City and</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.840" end="01:19:09.420" style="s2">where he was in history he said I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.660" end="01:19:12.420" style="s2">gonna go down this very narrow path but</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.420" end="01:19:16.170" style="s2">still let appear all these things that</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.420" end="01:19:19.890" style="s2">Heidi was worried a minute here saying</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.170" end="01:19:23.340" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna let appear yeah it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.890" end="01:19:25.200" style="s2">different way of thinking right go back</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.340" end="01:19:27.360" style="s2">to that thing what doesn&#39;t happen in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.200" end="01:19:30.480" style="s2">traditional sense of debating or arguing</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.360" end="01:19:32.990" style="s2">or proving a point right like in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.480" end="01:19:35.010" style="s2">certain sense were any even right now</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.990" end="01:19:37.470" style="s2">we&#39;re in a certain sense in this</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.010" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re letting a peer like</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.470" end="01:19:42.150" style="s2">we&#39;re letting up here is it that letting</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:45.750" style="s2">right starts to really kind of get at a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.150" end="01:19:48.060" style="s2">way of authentic care right in the mode</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.750" end="01:19:50.100" style="s2">and to care is my understanding what</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.060" end="01:19:52.020" style="s2">Heidegger was really talking about need</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.100" end="01:19:55.710" style="s2">the thing where I started to really get</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.020" end="01:20:00.150" style="s2">I started to get what temporality is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.710" end="01:20:03.219" style="s2">bit or or or let it like let it appear</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.150" end="01:20:04.659" style="s2">to me it&#39;s here&#39;s temper ality</p>

<p begin="01:20:04.659" end="01:20:07.239" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna give two analogies and you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.219" end="01:20:08.829" style="s2">can kind of get the difference</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.239" end="01:20:10.210" style="s2">so I&#39;m sitting at the car I&#39;m sitting at</p>

<p begin="01:22:46.550" end="01:22:52.280" style="s2">was just realization like that could be</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.330" end="01:22:54.790" style="s2">micro tiny realizations that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.280" end="01:22:57.350" style="s2">about twenty in this conversation or</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.790" end="01:22:59.750" style="s2">massive ones we really just change your</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.350" end="01:23:02.720" style="s2">entire life because something happens</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.750" end="01:23:05.180" style="s2">and you&#39;re not aware of the dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.720" end="01:23:06.350" style="s2">of time in that moment they&#39;re because</p>

<p begin="01:23:06.350" end="01:23:11.180" style="s2">and and I think the most reality this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.110" end="01:23:13.460" style="s2">time yes the most poetic kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.180" end="01:23:16.190" style="s2">representation of this is just quickly</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.460" end="01:23:18.440" style="s2">than nature story thus Spoke Zarathustra</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.190" end="01:23:20.900" style="s2">where&#39;s our third story goes up the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.440" end="01:23:23.510" style="s2">mountain carrying that dwarf on its back</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.900" end="01:23:27.560" style="s2">and he carries the dwarf on his back</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.510" end="01:23:29.810" style="s2">until he gets to a gate and he goes what</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.560" end="01:23:31.910" style="s2">was this gate where does the path lead</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.810" end="01:23:34.160" style="s2">and he turns to the dwarf and the dwarf</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.910" end="01:23:36.320" style="s2">sitting on the side of the gate off the</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.160" end="01:23:38.000" style="s2">path on a rock and he&#39;s looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.320" end="01:23:39.530" style="s2">looking at Sara through and look at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.000" end="01:23:42.260" style="s2">gain is saying are well all-time as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.530" end="01:23:44.720" style="s2">flat circle long time go straight in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.260" end="01:23:45.290" style="s2">circle circular in shape or something</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.720" end="01:23:47.630" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.290" end="01:23:51.320" style="s2">he says it in a very middle way right</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.630" end="01:23:54.710" style="s2">and xerath history goes no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.320" end="01:23:58.130" style="s2">right it&#39;s everything that was and is is</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.710" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">right here and I just have to face it</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.130" end="01:24:02.090" style="s2">I&#39;m just like and I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:04.990" style="s2">understand it necessarily I just have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.090" end="01:24:08.120" style="s2">be in this mode of being to understand</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.990" end="01:24:08.510" style="s2">the truth of this moment and where it</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.120" end="01:24:10.490" style="s2">could lead</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.510" end="01:24:12.200" style="s2">where the possibilities are which with</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.490" end="01:24:14.420" style="s2">Zarathustra like doesn&#39;t presuppose</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.200" end="01:24:17.270" style="s2">anything which is the power of the point</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.420" end="01:24:19.730" style="s2">of that that story where it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.270" end="01:24:23.450" style="s2">becomes basically a man of infinite</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.730" end="01:24:26.600" style="s2">possibilities and when he turns back the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.450" end="01:24:28.130" style="s2">dwarf disappears in that story nature</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.600" end="01:24:31.130" style="s2">obviously matter but it&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.130" end="01:24:33.290" style="s2">very important to him the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.130" end="01:24:34.750" style="s2">moment and the eternal recurrence the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.290" end="01:24:39.290" style="s2">same and everything like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.750" end="01:24:42.230" style="s2">the dwarfs like objectifying time and</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.290" end="01:24:43.699" style="s2">saying there is future past present</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.230" end="01:24:46.250" style="s2">circle you know you&#39;re just gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.699" end="01:24:48.590" style="s2">round around who cares and he&#39;s sitting</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.250" end="01:24:50.750" style="s2">on a side and it&#39;s like this metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.590" end="01:24:53.300" style="s2">works on so many levels because we do</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.750" end="01:24:54.949" style="s2">that all the time like we are the dwarf</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.300" end="01:24:57.949" style="s2">whether you&#39;re scientist or a theologian</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.949" end="01:25:00.530" style="s2">or just going day to day it&#39;s like now</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.949" end="01:25:02.719" style="s2">well yeah there&#39;s we talk in cliches</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.530" end="01:25:04.010" style="s2">about living in the moment and the few</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.719" end="01:25:06.139" style="s2">who knows what the future holds and all</p>
