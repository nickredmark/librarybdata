<p begin="00:00:01.060" end="00:00:03.060" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really realised I&#39;ll be it</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:04.660" style="s2">speaking to the audience that actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:06.480" style="s2">includes witches and wizards</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.120" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.560" end="00:00:10.120" style="s2">(voice from the audience)</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.360" end="00:00:13.520" style="s2">ye, I&#39;ll probably...I&#39;ll probably meet them in the question period,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.780" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">that will be my guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.060" end="00:00:17.060" style="s2">So, can you all hear me?</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.320" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">One of you can  hear me</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.380" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">How was that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:24.360" style="s2">That&#39;s better? Ok</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.360" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">All right. Good</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.420" end="00:00:28.100" style="s2">All right. So</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.680" end="00:00:30.860" style="s2">As you can plainly see</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.860" end="00:00:31.620" style="s2">the title of this talk is</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.820" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">&quot;Dragons,</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:33.380" style="s2">Divine Parents,</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.520" end="00:00:35.960" style="s2">Heroes and Adversaries:</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.960" end="00:00:37.860" style="s2">A complete cosmology of being&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.400" end="00:00:40.400" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.400" end="00:00:40.960" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:40.960" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">Sounds dreadfully New Age to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.640" end="00:00:45.560" style="s2">But it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.560" end="00:00:47.180" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.180" end="00:00:48.680" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.680" end="00:00:49.180" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.180" end="00:00:50.580" style="s2">New age people are very creative</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.620" end="00:00:52.040" style="s2">But they can&#39;t think critically</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.660" end="00:00:54.460" style="s2">But I can think critically</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.900" end="00:00:56.900" style="s2">So this is a creative</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.140" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:01:02.140" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2">theoretical enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.040" end="00:01:06.040" style="s2">Conjoint with the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.040" end="00:01:06.981" style="s2">to tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.981" end="00:01:07.481" style="s2">between  bad ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.540" end="00:01:08.920" style="s2">and good ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:10.820" style="s2">And hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.140" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.200" end="00:01:13.820" style="s2">are the graetest ideas  that humanity</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.960" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">has ever produced</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.120" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">They&#39;re are also ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.260" end="00:01:18.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re....</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.940" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">we dont understand well...</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.700" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.740" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">who&#39;s highest level of formal developement</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:29.980" style="s2">we risk forgetting because</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.080" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">we&#39;re criticising things</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.360" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve invented as a species, but that that we can not undersand rationally, and....</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.120" end="00:01:40.600" style="s2">We predisposed to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.860" end="00:01:45.020" style="s2">Ideas that we can&#39;t understand rationally have to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.400" end="00:01:49.420" style="s2">...and sometimes that&#39;s true; but sometimes we&#39;re just not smart enough to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.440" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.900" end="00:01:57.640" style="s2">I can give you an example of something that we are not really smart enough to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:02.820" style="s2">We are not really smart enough to understand, why people would line up for four nights...</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.820" end="00:02:05.000" style="s2">...for ten blocs to watch Star Wars,</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:08.740" style="s2">You know ;  I mean; they won&#39;t do that for a lecture.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.800" end="00:02:12.020" style="s2">( laughter )</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:14.920" style="s2">...and they wouldn&#39;t pay money...</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.260" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">So, you know, that Star Wars, for example, is naturally</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.300" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">...is naturally interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">Anad people just take that for granted.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:27.320" style="s2">But the fact, that people would line up..</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">To..to engage voluntarily in the ritual activity of that sort...</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.460" end="00:02:40.020" style="s2">..is a manifestation of something that is very deep in human psyche, that we do not comprehend well.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.220" end="00:02:43.960" style="s2">So, I&#39;m gonna talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.660" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">What I like to think about as &quot; a grammar of believe&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">I got interested in this, back in the mid-eighties</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">I was..</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.520" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">..I was driven mostly by the interest in...</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.360" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">...global warfare that was ideologicaly motivated, and also atrocity...</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:07.960" style="s2">Warefare was not so difficult to understand in some sense because you can map it on to...</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">...animal teritoriality...</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">But atrosity in a service of ideology is a wholle different thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.600" end="00:03:19.780" style="s2">There is certanly clearer that for example in a World War II,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.540" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">When the Nazis had to make a choice....perhaps between winning the war ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">And excelerating the rate in which they were killing Jews...</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:28.260" style="s2">...they chose the latter!</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.400" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">And it&#39;s very difficult to understand that  using a model based on the animal teritoriality</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.760" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">I started reading...</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.580" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.420" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">believe systems widely...</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">..in..</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.860" end="00:03:48.940" style="s2">... political writtings, and economic writtings, and religion writtings and psychological writtings</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:51.820" style="s2">Anywhere I could find a tread that i thought was promising</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.220" end="00:03:53.660" style="s2">I red a lot  of Jung,</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.800" end="00:03:54.840" style="s2">I red a lot of Freud,</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.840" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">Almost all  the  great clinical psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.120" end="00:04:00.760" style="s2">A lot of Solzhenitsyn, a lot of George Orwell</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.300" end="00:04:05.941" style="s2">A lot of people, lot of Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.941" end="00:04:10.360" style="s2">They&#39;re all people who, as far as I can tell,  have something very original to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.860" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">...and...</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.200" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">Out of that...</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.700" end="00:04:21.700" style="s2">I learned to understand why people need Believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.080" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">Why is actually inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.220" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">Why fait is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.920" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">Fait is inevitable in part because your knowlage is fine, and than so, you have to take some things for granted</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">Or you fall into an infinite regres</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">And what, maybe constituted the difference between pathological believe...</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.480" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">...and non pathological believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:43.920" style="s2">And those are terms, by the way, that I think can be defined technically</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.760" end="00:04:45.880" style="s2">Which is a...</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.180" style="s2">...statement that&#39;s runs contrary to the pre-supposition, say, of moral relativism</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.480" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">I&#39;m definately not a moral relativist</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.740" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">I think, it constitues a..</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">I think the motivation for moral relativism fundamentally is the desire to abdicate  responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.480" end="00:05:05.420" style="s2">Even though you can make a strong intelectual cases for</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:07.800" style="s2">...for why moral relativism is correct</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">The intelectual case in an actual motivation have nothing to do with one another however...</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.500" end="00:05:21.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve also found out something else, which is quite interesting, and I dont know how much I can touch on it tonight, but...</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.360" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">...I&#39;dont think that Newton and Darwin are commensurate</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:30.680" style="s2">I think that most modern peoples are Newtonians, not Darwinians</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:37.160" style="s2">And I think that , you can understand the grammar of believe, which is religious in nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:39.540" style="s2">Using Darwinian&#39;s principals</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.460" end="00:05:44.260" style="s2">But it means that you have to give up your Newtonian&#39;s pre-suppositions</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.620" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">And so..</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.140" end="00:05:50.420" style="s2">I think    I can make that argument implicitly with  what I&#39;m doing as   I progress tonight</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.420" end="00:05:52.680" style="s2">So the first thing I&#39;m going to tell you  is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">Its necessary for you to look at the world through the limited frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:00.900" style="s2">Other  reason for that  is  -  you&#39;re not very smart</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:06.020" style="s2">Your consciousness can only hundle about four bits of information per second</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.380" end="00:06:11.180" style="s2">It&#39;s not very much given that the number of bits of informations comming at you from external world are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">Pro  practical purposes   infinite</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.260" end="00:06:17.020" style="s2">You&#39;re like Aldous Huxley  sugested</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:20.500" style="s2">Your brain seems to be  primarily reducing agent</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:23.480" style="s2">Yyour bodies are reducing agent as well, because</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.660" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">There are a lot of things that  you just can&#39;t detect and than...</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.820" end="00:06:28.120" style="s2">Tthe room that you sitting in is a reducive agent because</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">Is keeping all sort of things  out</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">Tthat you would  otherwise have to deal with, and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.140" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">The stability of the city is reducing agent because</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.880" style="s2">We&#39;re not going to be stampeded by barbarians with any luck at every moment or any moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:41.660" style="s2">..we..</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.980" end="00:06:44.520" style="s2">...we deal with the complexity of the wotld in part by</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:47.300" style="s2">Iinhabiting a sequence of  reducing structures</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.300" end="00:06:51.160" style="s2">Until the world is reduced enough so that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.160" end="00:06:53.500" style="s2">Deal with the minute elements of it that we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">Comprehend at any one moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.780" end="00:06:57.740" style="s2">And those are elements we comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.180" end="00:06:58.820" style="s2">...am..</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.300" end="00:07:02.680" style="s2">Are not the familiar objects of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.680" end="00:07:03.580" style="s2">objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.740" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">Iin fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:05.480" style="s2">Animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.660" end="00:07:06.840" style="s2">and people included</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.840" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">Are not much interested in ojective reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.620" end="00:07:13.740" style="s2">We&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.740" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">pragmatic reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.020" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">Pragmatic reality is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">the reality you act on</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:21.080" style="s2">Not that you percieve</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.700" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">And because we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:25.220" style="s2">And because we are biological organisms</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.340" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">And because we are concerned</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.900" end="00:07:28.120" style="s2">with survival and reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.120" end="00:07:29.540" style="s2">Among other things</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.900" end="00:07:30.760" style="s2">How to act is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:32.900" style="s2">a much more important</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.900" end="00:07:34.480" style="s2">Much more important question for us then</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.480" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">What is the the world constituted of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.120" end="00:07:41.100" style="s2">How to act</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:41.760" style="s2">In some sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.820" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">is also the prime Darwinian question</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.020" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">Right? Because if you act</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.540" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">wrongly</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.640" end="00:07:49.760" style="s2">from a Darwinian perspective you end up dead</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.760" end="00:07:50.760" style="s2">before you can reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.140" end="00:07:55.140" style="s2">So Darwinism</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.140" end="00:07:56.680" style="s2">Is a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:07:59.080" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.080" end="00:07:59.780" style="s2">In fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.860" end="00:08:02.140" style="s2">The pragmatysts, the... the american pragmatists on the ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.440" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:08:03.500" end="00:08:05.200" style="s2">North American east coast</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.760" end="00:08:07.060" style="s2">Recognised that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:09.780" style="s2">Very short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.860" end="00:08:11.420" style="s2">after Darwin&#39;s studies was published</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.540" end="00:08:13.340" style="s2">They recognised the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.420" end="00:08:14.680" style="s2">pragmatism as a theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.860" end="00:08:15.420" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.560" end="00:08:17.160" style="s2">Darwinian theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:19.540" style="s2">instantaneously</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">So the world tht we inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.480" end="00:08:25.660" style="s2">given that we&#39;re alive</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.420" end="00:08:26.980" style="s2">And given that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.980" end="00:08:27.900" style="s2">What&#39;s selected as &quot;selected&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.100" end="00:08:29.320" style="s2">As to act is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.340" end="00:08:30.820" style="s2">Actually the  pragmatic world</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.040" end="00:08:33.980" style="s2">And the objects of pragmatic worlds</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.980" end="00:08:35.020" style="s2">aren&#39;t objects</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.100" end="00:08:36.140" style="s2">They&#39;re tools</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.140" end="00:08:37.860" style="s2">And obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:40.100" style="s2">And they have valiance</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.160" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">a  priority!  They&#39;re....</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.520" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">They have value A priority</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.900" end="00:08:46.340" style="s2">From the Newtonian&#39;s perspective you look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.980" end="00:08:49.260" style="s2">And then you think about the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.260" end="00:08:50.040" style="s2">that you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.040" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">The objects of the world that you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">And than you evaluate them</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:53.280" style="s2">And then you act</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.280" end="00:08:55.180" style="s2">That is not how the brain works</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.900" end="00:08:57.320" style="s2">Is just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:00.840" style="s2">You might see the value of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:01.780" style="s2">before you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.780" end="00:09:02.680" style="s2">the object itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.400" end="00:09:04.820" style="s2">I mean...there are people  for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:05.740" style="s2">Who are blind</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.780" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">They are blindsight</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.680" end="00:09:07.980" style="s2">They can recognise emotions or faces</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:10.280" style="s2">thay  can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.100" end="00:09:11.640" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.060" end="00:09:12.780" style="s2">That&#39;s partialy</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.780" end="00:09:15.260" style="s2">Because the retina is attached to they&#39;r amygdala</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.260" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">The retina is attached</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.300" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">to  lot of your body</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.500" end="00:09:19.780" style="s2">Not just your visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.780" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">It&#39;s attached to your spinal cord</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">It&#39;s attached to your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.180" end="00:09:26.920" style="s2">And, so you can use your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.960" end="00:09:27.460" style="s2">to detect things</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.460" end="00:09:29.320" style="s2">That you dont know you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.380" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">Than in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:35.480" style="s2">What you&#39;re after  to detect in those circumstances is..</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">&quot;valience&quot; - value so</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">You&#39;re very good for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.640" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">at detecting teeth</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.820" end="00:09:42.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.360" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">predatory eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:45.320" style="s2">the reasons for that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">self evident</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.700" end="00:09:47.540" style="s2">Fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.280" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">This is the smallest  unit</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">of meanning that makes up</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">a referential frame</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:55.860" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.840" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">It has</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.980" end="00:09:58.920" style="s2">three elements</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:01.880" style="s2">One of which links the mind to the body</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.040" end="00:10:03.160" style="s2">Actually  the mind-body problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.260" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">is not that difficult to solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">If once you take a pragmatic..</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.780" end="00:10:08.300" style="s2">Once you look at how the brain works</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.300" end="00:10:09.640" style="s2">from the pragmatic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.640" end="00:10:10.580" style="s2">Because then</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:11.220" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.220" end="00:10:12.120" style="s2">your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.120" end="00:10:13.160" style="s2">Is fundamentally something</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.160" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">That is grounded in action</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.100" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">And you can undersand the transition</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:18.580" style="s2">Between consciousness and action</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.580" end="00:10:20.220" style="s2">As a sequence of ...of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.220" end="00:10:22.000" style="s2">Analysis that are increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.000" end="00:10:23.300" style="s2">Action oriented</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.420" end="00:10:24.960" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk to you about it a little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.960" end="00:10:27.240" style="s2">But the basic framework is something like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.240" end="00:10:28.620" style="s2">And you&#39;re always looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.740" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">Through this framework</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:31.380" style="s2">And the framework has one point</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.380" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">Where you are and what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">Where you are now</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:36.420" style="s2">So that&#39;s point &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">You always trying to get from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.100" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">Because you are linear creature</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.260" end="00:10:41.240" style="s2">And you&#39; re embodied</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.280" end="00:10:42.420" style="s2">So you are moving</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.420" end="00:10:43.300" style="s2">And so... fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.300" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">What you looking at the world through</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:46.200" style="s2">Is a sequence of maps</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.200" end="00:10:47.620" style="s2">And maps tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.620" end="00:10:49.160" style="s2">How to get to where you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.400" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">And so..the maps specify where you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:53.100" style="s2">Because obviously you can&#39;t get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.260" end="00:10:54.300" style="s2">If you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.780" end="00:10:56.780" style="s2">And many people of course are confused where they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.780" end="00:10:58.180" style="s2">So they dont get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.740" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">And you also has to know where are you going</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.520" end="00:11:02.960" style="s2">And that&#39;s point &quot;A&quot; and point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.980" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">And every time you look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.360" end="00:11:06.040" style="s2">You&#39;re looking through a framework</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.120" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">That has those two valued points implicit</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:10.900" style="s2">In your cognitive structure</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.900" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">And generaly what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:15.980" style="s2">&quot;Where you going is better than where you are&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.200" end="00:11:18.200" style="s2">Because otherwise why would you go there?</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.360" end="00:11:19.560" style="s2">Now. Some people do choose</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.740" end="00:11:20.580" style="s2">To go to the places</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.580" end="00:11:21.080" style="s2">That are worse  that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.080" end="00:11:21.720" style="s2">Where they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.780" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">But they are &quot;special case&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:25.000" style="s2">You probably live with some of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:27.220" style="s2">( audience laughs)</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.560" end="00:11:30.700" style="s2">Now, when you&#39;re  going</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.780" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">From point &quot;A&quot; to point&quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.680" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">Fundamentally you have to move</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.980" end="00:11:36.980" style="s2">And movement is not &quot;abstract&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.460" end="00:11:39.460" style="s2">Movement is what you do with your body</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.780" end="00:11:42.620" style="s2">And so..once your abstract representation</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:44.780" style="s2">Transform itself into action</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.020" end="00:11:47.280" style="s2">You are no longer in the realm of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">So in order to get from one place to another</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:51.080" style="s2">You have to know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.080" end="00:11:53.140" style="s2">And you have to know where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.140" end="00:11:55.840" style="s2">And you have to what?  fly ,run, roar</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:11:57.560" style="s2">You have to perform</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.740" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">Some sort of ambodied action</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">To get there</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.080" end="00:12:01.720" style="s2">And of course you have conscious control</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.840" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">over your volountary muscular system</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.320" end="00:12:05.320" style="s2">But underneath that you dont realy have enything at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.320" end="00:12:06.520" style="s2">Right? you can move your arm</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.780" end="00:12:08.980" style="s2">You have no idea what muscles you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.220" end="00:12:11.840" style="s2">So that your conscious representation of your body</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.960" end="00:12:13.960" style="s2">Grounds out basicly involountary movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.960" end="00:12:16.020" style="s2">of the larger muscles systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:17.240" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:19.220" style="s2">Now you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:21.240" style="s2">What does specify</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.240" end="00:12:22.280" style="s2">Where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.360" end="00:12:23.380" style="s2">And the answer to that,</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.380" end="00:12:24.140" style="s2">In large part is biology</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.260" end="00:12:26.260" style="s2">But biology in a complex manner</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.420" end="00:12:27.820" style="s2">And this is where the higher order</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.820" end="00:12:29.720" style="s2">Morality starts to become a concern</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.540" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">You share with other animals</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:35.900" style="s2">All the way down the fild of genetic chain</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.380" end="00:12:37.640" style="s2">Various forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.640" end="00:12:40.920" style="s2">of implicit motivation and, you know, you can kind of lump those</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.920" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">It&#39;s arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.180" end="00:12:44.640" style="s2">I lump them into &quot;self-mainenance&quot; motivations</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.640" end="00:12:46.700" style="s2">And &quot;self-propagation&quot; motivations</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.740" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">You can pack it different ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">Like I said: it&#39;s more conseptual</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.500" end="00:12:52.500" style="s2">Than based on-say-you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.500" end="00:12:54.040" style="s2">Anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.040" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">But it&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:12:56.580" style="s2">&quot;Self-maintenance&quot; well</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.580" end="00:12:57.820" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to get too hot</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.820" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">You don&#39;t wonna get to cold</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:00.420" style="s2">Your hypothalamus deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.420" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">Very old part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.860" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">Is way more important than your cortex</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">You can take the whole cortex of the female cat</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.900" end="00:13:08.900" style="s2">And as long as you keep it in the cage</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.900" end="00:13:10.400" style="s2">And it has its hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.400" end="00:13:11.560" style="s2">It can pretty much behave</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.560" end="00:13:12.180" style="s2">Like a cat</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.180" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">Exept that is hypo-exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:15.780" style="s2">Which is the last thing you&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.780" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">From an animal with no brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.420" end="00:13:20.280" style="s2">You can&#39;t be too hot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.280" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">You can&#39;t be too cold</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">You got to regulate your water intake</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:25.140" style="s2">You have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.940" end="00:13:27.940" style="s2">You have to deal with  consequences of eating</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.940" end="00:13:29.340" style="s2">You have to be with other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.340" end="00:13:30.300" style="s2">There is a place circuit,</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.340" end="00:13:31.580" style="s2">A specialised place circuit</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.820" end="00:13:34.460" style="s2">There is a specialised erotic circuit</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.160" end="00:13:37.580" style="s2">There is specialised circuit for exploration</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.640" end="00:13:39.980" style="s2">Which is...it.does  half what the hypothalamus does, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.200" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">And those systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:45.200" style="s2">They often have been conceptualized</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.200" end="00:13:45.960" style="s2">as &quot;drives&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.260" end="00:13:47.320" style="s2">But they not really that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.320" end="00:13:48.260" style="s2">They more like</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.760" end="00:13:51.700" style="s2">Isolated one eye personalities</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.980" end="00:13:53.540" style="s2">They&#39;re like Cyclops</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.960" end="00:13:55.580" style="s2">They want one thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.580" end="00:13:56.860" style="s2">Now, they&#39;re not stupid</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.940" end="00:13:58.940" style="s2">But they not very...</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.940" end="00:14:00.840" style="s2">...amenable to argument</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.840" end="00:14:02.420" style="s2">So when you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.420" end="00:14:03.140" style="s2">You&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.180" end="00:14:04.940" style="s2">And, you know, another motivational system</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:06.140" style="s2">might object to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.140" end="00:14:07.640" style="s2">But..and that&#39;s happens frequently,</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.700" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">Which is partly why people are often confused,</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.280" end="00:14:12.280" style="s2">And also why you need a cortex</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.280" end="00:14:13.560" style="s2">Because, you know, you need a cortex</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.680" end="00:14:16.680" style="s2">To allow the computic motivational system</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.740" end="00:14:19.580" style="s2">To array them-selves properly and harmonously</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">Across time</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">so they all get they do</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:24.580" style="s2">Insted of fighting like two years-old&#39;s in the room</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.680" end="00:14:27.060" style="s2">Because two-year old&#39;s a basicaly hypothalamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.280" end="00:14:28.120" style="s2">You know. So there are lots of fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.120" end="00:14:29.540" style="s2">But they are not organised</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.540" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">And they are not social at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.640" end="00:14:33.640" style="s2">So what happens with the motivational system</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.640" end="00:14:35.080" style="s2">Is very deep in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.080" end="00:14:36.180" style="s2">Is they</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:39.260" style="s2">They specify the value of where you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.260" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">So one of the values</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:42.060" style="s2">might be...I&#39;m thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:43.580" style="s2">And than</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.800" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">They tune your perception so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.840" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">Things that are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.540" end="00:14:49.020" style="s2">The quenching of thirst</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.220" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">Are much more likely to be picked up by your perceptual system</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.200" end="00:14:53.700" style="s2">And they bias your</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.200" end="00:14:55.300" style="s2">Perceptual processing</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.300" end="00:14:56.580" style="s2">And your valuation</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.600" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">towards the.....</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.460" end="00:15:00.460" style="s2">Towards improvement of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.460" end="00:15:02.040" style="s2">motivational lack</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.680" end="00:15:04.680" style="s2">And so you can&#39;t really think of them as drives</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:06.600" style="s2">Because they way more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.600" end="00:15:07.940" style="s2">They specify where you are</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.940" end="00:15:09.580" style="s2">So there is an element of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.580" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">That associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:12.040" style="s2">&quot;I&#39;m thirsty&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.400" end="00:15:14.400" style="s2">And they specify your target</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.400" end="00:15:15.960" style="s2">Usualy using fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.960" end="00:15:17.400" style="s2">You know, when you get thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.400" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">You think : what I&#39;d like to drink and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:20.260" style="s2">You&#39;ve little fantasy about</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.260" end="00:15:22.520" style="s2">Maybe a glass of juice or a bit of water</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.580" end="00:15:23.720" style="s2">Or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.720" end="00:15:24.680" style="s2">And then your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:26.300" style="s2">Is tuned and you walk into a kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.300" end="00:15:28.420" style="s2">And you ignore everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.440" end="00:15:30.520" style="s2">That&#39;s irrelevant to the serch for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.900" end="00:15:34.100" style="s2">Liquid and you focus on everything that relevant</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.100" end="00:15:35.580" style="s2">To the serch for liquid and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.580" end="00:15:37.200" style="s2">Thats means you so blind</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.200" end="00:15:38.460" style="s2">You can not believe it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.460" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">There&#39;s been many experiments now</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.980" end="00:15:41.200" style="s2">That have shown that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.960" end="00:15:43.520" style="s2">You can do things like</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.520" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">I&#39;m sure that some of you seen this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">You can introduce a gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.600" end="00:15:48.400" style="s2">Into a basketball game</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.160" style="s2">and 60% or 70%  of the people watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.160" end="00:15:52.600" style="s2">As long as they paying attention to the ball</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:15:53.640" style="s2">They wont see the gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.640" end="00:15:55.000" style="s2">And it&#39;s not like a little, tiny gorrila</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.000" end="00:15:56.120" style="s2">That somewhere of in the corner</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.120" end="00:15:57.620" style="s2">It&#39;s like  maine centre</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:15:59.760" style="s2">6 feet high beatting his chest</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.760" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">And, even when you know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:03.020" style="s2">If something else chenges in the background</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.020" end="00:16:04.040" style="s2">You wont see that either</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">So as far as you guys know</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.520" end="00:16:06.520" style="s2">that...</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.960" end="00:16:08.780" style="s2">Carpet could be changing colour</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.780" end="00:16:09.900" style="s2">50; 20 times a minute</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.900" end="00:16:10.960" style="s2">You wouldn&#39;t even notice it</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.960" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">Unless, you have some weird obsession with carpets</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.200" end="00:16:14.740" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">Ok. So that&#39;s the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.060" end="00:16:18.860" style="s2">In some sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:20.660" style="s2">Of the universal system of values, right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.660" end="00:16:22.520" style="s2">And I can tell you how universl this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.520" end="00:16:23.840" style="s2">I always have to tell the story</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.840" end="00:16:24.640" style="s2">Because its dumb funny</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">I just cannot believe it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.200" end="00:16:26.700" style="s2">..So...</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:30.100" style="s2">One of the things that your brain is very concern with</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.100" end="00:16:31.660" style="s2">Is relative status</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.660" end="00:16:32.708" style="s2">That&#39;s why you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.708" end="00:16:33.260" style="s2">By the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.260" end="00:16:34.140" style="s2">Which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.220" end="00:16:35.860" style="s2">Partly why relative poverty</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.860" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">Is often such a social problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:39.560" style="s2">People hate being low in status</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:41.260" style="s2">Specially man</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.780" end="00:16:43.160" style="s2">Male status hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.160" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">Is a bit different than women</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.100" end="00:16:45.940" style="s2">And women are pretty sensitive to status too</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.940" end="00:16:47.520" style="s2">But they use different markers</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.520" end="00:16:48.340" style="s2">Anyways</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:49.880" style="s2">Part what happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:50.760" style="s2">When your status go up</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.780" end="00:16:53.180" style="s2">Is that your brain serotonin level goes up</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.260" end="00:16:55.140" style="s2">And when your brain serotonin level goes up</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.500" end="00:16:58.580" style="s2">You&#39;re less irritable and you expierience</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.580" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">Less negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">Per unit of uncertenity your threat</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.080" end="00:17:04.080" style="s2">And so when you demean someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.220" end="00:17:06.220" style="s2">And you interfiere with</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.540" end="00:17:09.440" style="s2">And you lower they presume status</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.440" end="00:17:10.780" style="s2">As far as the very primodial</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.780" end="00:17:12.280" style="s2">Circuit is concern</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.440" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">You alter the system that regulates their emotions</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.340" end="00:17:17.000" style="s2">And they hate that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.000" end="00:17:18.940" style="s2">People hate that more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.960" end="00:17:21.140" style="s2">And it&#39;s an unbelieveble archaic circuit</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:22.780" style="s2">You can kind&#39; tell this because</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.780" end="00:17:23.980" style="s2">Depresed people</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.980" end="00:17:25.900" style="s2">Basicaly act like they are low status</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:27.620" style="s2">And depress people  are depress about</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.620" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">Everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.500" end="00:17:31.420" style="s2">Now. There is not easy to be depressed</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.420" end="00:17:33.180" style="s2">About everything, right?</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.180" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">And so the fact that that the case</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:36.740" style="s2">Means that whatsever gone estray</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.740" end="00:17:38.600" style="s2">Has to be very primodial</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.600" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">Because it efects everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.540" end="00:17:41.880" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.880" end="00:17:43.300" style="s2">People often use</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.300" end="00:17:45.800" style="s2">anty-depressant to cure depression</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:47.620" style="s2">Hence their name</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">and anty-depressants</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.900" end="00:17:54.000" style="s2">Decrease the rate in which serotonin is taken back up</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:55.540" style="s2">By the nurons that produce it</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.740" end="00:17:56.680" style="s2">well...</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">300 millions years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">Crustaceans emerged</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:04.400" style="s2">And crustaceans lives in dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">Even if they&#39;re not particulary social</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.260" end="00:18:09.500" style="s2">And if one lobster fights with another</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.500" end="00:18:10.660" style="s2">And gets defeated</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.660" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">Than he won&#39;t fight with another lobster</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">Even if he beats for 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">Unless you give him anty-depressant</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.160" end="00:18:19.160" style="s2">In which case he will fight right away</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.160" end="00:18:20.760" style="s2">The reason I&#39;m telling you this</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:21.780" style="s2">is because</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.960" end="00:18:23.960" style="s2">The status structure, that...</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.540" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">Underlines</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:29.460" style="s2">Your being , not just your brains, but your being</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.940" end="00:18:31.940" style="s2">Is... is so old</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.940" end="00:18:33.720" style="s2">You share it with crusstaceas</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">So you mess with that at your peril</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:40.260" style="s2">It&#39;s not learned</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.440" end="00:18:42.180" style="s2">By no means</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">So anyways</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.740" end="00:18:47.160" style="s2">You wonder around inside one of this little frames</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.160" end="00:18:49.300" style="s2">Going from point&quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot; over time</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.300" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">And one annoying things about life is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:52.180" style="s2">And this is one of the Sisyphus&#39;s story is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.180" end="00:18:55.140" style="s2">As soon as you climb from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:18:56.300" style="s2">And you get there</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.300" end="00:18:56.800" style="s2">Than</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.900" end="00:18:58.600" style="s2">There is another point &quot;A&quot;and another  point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.600" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">Thats kind of interesting too because</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:02.860" style="s2">One of the thing that suggest is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.500" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">Getting somwhere isn&#39;t really what people want</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.900" end="00:19:08.200" style="s2">Because as soon as you get somwhere than you&#39;re done going there</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.200" end="00:19:09.960" style="s2">And then you have to go somwhere else,so</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.200" end="00:19:13.480" style="s2">In some sense it seams it is an acomplishment and in another sens it is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:18.660" style="s2">The next go up on the mountain, and we all know this because you know, you all graduated from the university</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.660" end="00:19:23.640" style="s2">And that was a good day but the next day you were&#39;nt  university student, you were just some unemployed looser</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.120" end="00:19:28.020" style="s2">You  know, and so, and that&#39;s sets up the whole new set of problems, right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.100" end="00:19:30.600" style="s2">And that how the whole frame shifts</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.680" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">And when the frame shifts like that , than the value of everything shifts around it</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">Turns out  that people are actually  more interested in getting from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:44.220" style="s2">Than they are in actually being at point B</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:49.940" style="s2">And all the positive emotions that you feel which is related to dopaminergic circuitory by the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.020" end="00:19:54.340" style="s2">You experience in relationship  to the pursuit of the value goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.340" end="00:19:56.580" style="s2">Rather than to attainment of the goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">The attainment of the goal actually satisfies you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.380" end="00:20:03.860" style="s2">Or more specificlly it satisfy that motivational circuit,but then the dumb thing just shuts off</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.860" end="00:20:06.500" style="s2">And another one starts yelling at you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.500" end="00:20:08.800" style="s2">So is like pervers form of victory</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.360" end="00:20:13.820" style="s2">One answer to that that universal in some sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.820" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">You should establish a relationship with the transcended value</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.660" end="00:20:20.680" style="s2">Because it never runs out of motivational power</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.020" end="00:20:25.460" style="s2">You can see an example of that , popular example in popular culture in a &quot;Pinoccio&quot; movie</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">How many of you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.900" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">Is anybobody not seen it?</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">Hmmm, thats amusing</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:34.260" style="s2">Anyways</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.080" end="00:20:37.220" style="s2">In the &quot;Pinoccio&quot; movie one of the things that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.220" end="00:20:38.540" style="s2">When Gepetto wishes</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.680" end="00:20:41.860" style="s2">That his son becomes a fully developed individual insted of the dumb puppet</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.260" end="00:20:44.260" style="s2">Which is a good thing for parent to wish, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">He wishes upon a star and a star is signify something of the transcendent value, and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:54.680" style="s2">The meaning of that fundamentally  is, that if you want to raise your child to be an independent being</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.680" end="00:20:58.020" style="s2">Than you better set your site on something trascendent or it won&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.040" end="00:21:00.980" style="s2">And believe me there is a lot of time that it  doesn&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">Part of the utility of the transcendent value is that it never looses its motivational effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:10.660" style="s2">Now you might say that is no prove that they are transcendent values,</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">It&#39;s like- yee, thats true,but you know,there is more to the story</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.220" end="00:21:15.560" style="s2">Ok, so..</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.620" end="00:21:20.100" style="s2">When you in one of this little stories, which is basically what they are,</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.160" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">The simplest story :I was in one place; I went by this means to another place</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.340" end="00:21:27.040" style="s2">Thats the simplest story</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.040" end="00:21:28.360" style="s2">Its not that exciting</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.380" end="00:21:32.220" style="s2">Much more exciting story is :&quot; I was going from point &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and something weird happened&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:35.800" style="s2">&quot;And than I didnt know where I was; and than I was in chaos for</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:37.820" style="s2">...you know, two years, and than...</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.880" end="00:21:40.800" style="s2">I figured out how to climb out of there&quot; Everybody likes that story, right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.800" end="00:21:43.720" style="s2">Thats the death and re-birth story by the way or...</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.720" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">A fall from paradise story</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.660" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">With the regaining of the paradise at the end</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:50.740" style="s2">You know, its an archetypal story because everyone lives it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.740" end="00:21:52.220" style="s2">And so...</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">Anyways, when you in one of this little</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.900" end="00:21:58.440" style="s2">...Stories....frames of reference...</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.460" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">What you see in front of you are really things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.660" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">One of the best scientist who ever study visual perception</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.320" end="00:22:07.320" style="s2">Called</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.800" end="00:22:11.460" style="s2">The book&#39;s called : &quot;Ecological approach to visual perception&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.820" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">He called them &quot;affordances&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.180" end="00:22:16.560" style="s2">And affordance is something that affords you something</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.560" end="00:22:18.520" style="s2">And affordances can be both:positive and negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.540" end="00:22:21.400" style="s2">I like to think of than as a tools or obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.400" end="00:22:27.500" style="s2">So for example; If I need to make a B line for that door you guys are all instantly obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.500" end="00:22:30.280" style="s2">And the way I would respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:33.080" style="s2">Like, implicitly, is that: you all be negative</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.140" end="00:22:35.140" style="s2">So imagine that we just set fire</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.720" end="00:22:40.340" style="s2">Well you were people the minute before that, but, you know, the second after that you&#39;re obstrucles</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.660" style="s2">And your emotional reaction to the people that are in front of you are going to reflect that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.700" end="00:22:47.420" style="s2">You all know that because you drive,  you know and...</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.420" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">Once you encapsulated in your little insect-toy-shell</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.880" end="00:22:56.620" style="s2">And dont&#39;t have to deal with the immediat  responses of  other people, you gonna treat them like obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.620" end="00:23:00.340" style="s2">And like, you know, demonic obstracles at the drop of a hat</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.600" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">And , you know that&#39;s pretty much  automatic behaviour</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.420" end="00:23:06.520" style="s2">So, two other things that get you to where you wanna go,</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.520" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">And you remember, you know, human beings are tool using animals &quot; per excelence&quot;, right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.760" end="00:23:13.340" style="s2">We are so tool using that, thats what we see</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.340" end="00:23:15.260" style="s2">It&#39;s build right in to us</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.380" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">We always scanning the world for tools, when you look at gravel for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.620" style="s2">What you actually see are throwing size rocks</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.140" style="s2">That&#39;s why they manifest themselves as that kind of object to the enviroment, you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.240" end="00:23:32.180" style="s2">You&#39;re build at certain level of resolution and the way your nervous system parts up the world is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:35.900" style="s2">Into things that are useful for you and things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.900" end="00:23:37.580" style="s2">And those are not objects</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.260" end="00:23:40.260" style="s2">The whole idea of object is a...</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.540" end="00:23:44.760" style="s2">...Very, very modern derivative of that mach more primodial system</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">And its, by no means, clear at all that our notion of objects is more real than the notion of affordance</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:54.180" style="s2">In fact, as far  as your brain is concerned</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.360" end="00:23:55.800" style="s2">Objects</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.980" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">...no one cares about objects...</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.780" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">What your brain cares about are affordances, and what your brain is adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.960" end="00:24:05.100" style="s2">Is the world as a set of affordances and obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.140" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">And if you are Darwinian, its very difficult to escape the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.960" end="00:24:13.700" style="s2">That what selected you is reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.040" end="00:24:19.560" style="s2">And so that if the reality that selected you shape you so that what you see are affordances and obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.560" end="00:24:20.900" style="s2">Or you die</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.140" end="00:24:23.300" style="s2">Then is perfectly real preposition</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.300" end="00:24:28.900" style="s2">Perfectly resonable proposition to state that what reality is , in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.900" end="00:24:32.580" style="s2">Is the set of affordances, tools and obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:34.740" style="s2">And that is how your brain works, by the way,</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.780" end="00:24:37.400" style="s2">When you look at..there,look at the projector</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.400" end="00:24:39.300" style="s2">Maybe I&#39;m thinking about picking it up?</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.460" end="00:24:44.140" style="s2">What happens is my eyes activate a part of my motocortex that would adjust my hand</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.140" end="00:24:45.380" style="s2">To grip it like that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.400" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">And so part what I understand as a projector is grip-able object</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:52.620" style="s2">And thats not secondary deravation,</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.620" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">I dont see the object and than think this is how I would grip it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:57.740" style="s2">Its like that would take forever</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.120" end="00:25:01.240" style="s2">You know, you&#39;d never catch a baseball if that&#39;s what you&#39;re were doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.260" end="00:25:04.700" style="s2">Its like &quot; Oh, a round object is...clunk!...&quot; You know, its like...</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.700" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">Thats just not gonna work.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">Really, your nervous system is no where fast enough to do that consciously</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.860" end="00:25:13.580" style="s2">You&#39;re using reptile&#39;s circuitry to catch baseballs</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.580" end="00:25:15.860" style="s2">The mammalian staff is to dump slow</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.920" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">So you catch the ball often, especially if someone piches it fast before you can even see it!</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">You just think you sow it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:24.060" style="s2">You see it after you caught it!</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.280" end="00:25:26.740" style="s2">The case with table players too</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:30.740" style="s2">They...what they seam to do is judge where the ball is going to go by the angle of the racket</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.800" end="00:25:36.200" style="s2">Because if they wait till the ball is of the racket, they can&#39;t move fast enough to hit it back</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.200" end="00:25:38.140" style="s2">They don&#39;t have the reflexes for it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:41.700" style="s2">So they can&#39;t move the neuromessages fast enough to do it!</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:47.180" style="s2">Ok, so basically, the world lay itself as tools and obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.400" end="00:25:49.800" style="s2">And, you know, obstracles make you feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:53.920" style="s2">But like , lets say: I&#39;m looking at this room and I&#39;m thinking about you guys as an obstracles</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.980" end="00:25:56.380" style="s2">You might say how bad does that make me feel?</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.380" end="00:25:59.780" style="s2">And answer to that is : not very bad, because all I have to do is, you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.820" end="00:26:02.340" style="s2">Make a circuit this route and I can get to the door</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.560" end="00:26:08.600" style="s2">So than the fact that you&#39;re obstracles is a very minor impediment to the execution of my plan</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.220" style="s2">And as a consequence it will produce corespondingly low level of negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.740" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">So. You can think of those as known unknowns.</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.860" end="00:26:19.240" style="s2">In Rumsfeld terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.480" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">Known unknowns are not that biger problem because you can plan for them</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.680" end="00:26:27.480" style="s2">And you might have a plan that&#39;s atlernative plan that you can put in place in case they show up</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.020" end="00:26:31.260" style="s2">What people really don&#39;t like are unknown unknowns</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.660" end="00:26:36.360" style="s2">And unknown unknownes , you don&#39;t walk around those , man. They blow your whole map.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.600" end="00:26:40.160" style="s2">And your map is quite comlicated. Its actually hierarchical in structure.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.160" end="00:26:41.280" style="s2">And I &#39;ll get to that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.280" end="00:26:46.620" style="s2">Because, you know, you go from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;so that you can go to a  bigger point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.620" end="00:26:47.720" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.720" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">You cross the road to get to the library</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:51.580" style="s2">To study for the exam, to  pass the exam</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.580" end="00:26:52.900" style="s2">To get your degree, to get the job</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.900" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">To be a person, to be a citizen, to be a , you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">To have a good life</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.600" end="00:26:58.600" style="s2">So then if someone gets in your way</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.600" end="00:27:02.800" style="s2">While you crossing the road, then to some degree, they&#39;re interfering with you getting the good life</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.800" end="00:27:04.440" style="s2">Now, not very much</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.520" end="00:27:06.500" style="s2">But sometimes you react like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.500" end="00:27:09.640" style="s2">That&#39;s certenly happens when you dealing with the intimate partner, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.640" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">Because they will make some little mistake</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:18.620" style="s2">And you&#39;ll say &quot;You always do that, you&#39;ve always done that, you always do and you&#39;re always going to do it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:21.620" style="s2">Which is really not a good way to conduct an argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.760" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:25.560" style="s2">Unknown unknowns.</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.600" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">Well,  unknown unknowns leap at you from places that you wouldn&#39;t expect.</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.620" end="00:27:33.900" style="s2">Because otherwise you would have planned for the dumb things,</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.900" end="00:27:37.500" style="s2">So there are the things, that always like poke their beak up at you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.500" end="00:27:38.840" style="s2">When you least expect it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.840" end="00:27:41.480" style="s2">They are just like, say, serpents in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.480" end="00:27:45.280" style="s2">That might be one way of thinking about it. You can&#39;t keep the dumb snakes out of the garden.</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.560" end="00:27:50.020" style="s2">And that&#39;s because you can&#39;t make the bound the area and keep the complexity out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.040" end="00:27:54.440" style="s2">The complexity always sneaks back in, try protecting your children from the internet</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.440" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">For example</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.280" end="00:27:59.500" style="s2">You can&#39;t make the bounded  circumstances and get rid of the complexity,</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">It always comes sneaking back in</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.660" end="00:28:05.080" style="s2">So, what would be an unknown unknown? This is a good one here:</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.180" end="00:28:07.860" style="s2">You have an intimate relationship . You&#39;ve had it for ten years.</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.860" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">You trust your partner</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:11.080" style="s2">So, what does that  mean?</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.080" end="00:28:12.360" style="s2">You know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:15.000" style="s2">You know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.620" end="00:28:18.120" style="s2">And you have pretty good idea of where you&#39;re going!</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.280" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">And then one day you find out that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:21.500" style="s2">Your partner have been cheating on you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.620" end="00:28:24.020" style="s2">Not with one person , but with three people!</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.020" end="00:28:26.060" style="s2">And for the whole ten years!</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">Well, hipotheticaly that comes as a shock!</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.660" end="00:28:34.460" style="s2">Or thou, you may have ignored many intimations that such might be the case</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.460" end="00:28:35.800" style="s2">Irrelevant!</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.800" end="00:28:39.340" style="s2">Lets say that it comes as a shock! Well , what happends to you?</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.460" end="00:28:41.820" style="s2">Now you don&#39;t know where you are !</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.420" end="00:28:44.360" style="s2">You don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve been!</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.360" end="00:28:45.880" style="s2">That&#39;s interesting, hey?</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.900" end="00:28:49.040" style="s2">Because you think you know where you&#39;ve been, because you&#39;ve already been there!</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.100" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">But all of the sudden something can happen so that you are so fliped over</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.300" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">That you dont even knowwhere you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.260" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">So that means in some sense , that past is dependent on the present</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">Very peculiar thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:04.040" style="s2">You also have no idea where you going</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:07.900" style="s2">In terms of not knowing where you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">That&#39;s deep, hey? Because you might think</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.700" end="00:29:13.740" style="s2">&quot;Well ,  I , you know , I thought I was in the marriage, that turns out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.060" end="00:29:16.660" style="s2">I thought I knew who my wife or husband was</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.660" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">That turns out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.780" style="s2">I concluded on the bases that I knew my wife that I knew something about woman</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.000" end="00:29:25.140" style="s2">That turns out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.720" end="00:29:28.700" style="s2">I thought I was in the relationship with someone I can trust</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">That is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t know enough about trust, I&#39;m obviously to galuble</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:37.580" style="s2">And so , what that does it throw, vertualy everything that&#39;s ever happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.580" end="00:29:39.260" style="s2">in severe doubt, right?</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.320" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">That the emergence of chaos!</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.200" end="00:29:44.200" style="s2">And that&#39;s ...</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">...this!...</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.040" end="00:29:47.060" style="s2">Sometimes,</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.660" end="00:29:49.660" style="s2">You are going from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.800" end="00:29:53.380" style="s2">And something you don&#39;t expect manifest itself , in the middle of your plan.</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.380" end="00:29:55.060" style="s2">But its not such a catastrophy.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.060" end="00:29:56.160" style="s2">Because you can just look around it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.180" end="00:30:01.680" style="s2">And then sometimes, something pops up and like , you just do not have a plan anymore!</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.740" end="00:30:03.560" style="s2">And so then you might ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.560" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">Just exactly where are you when you dont know where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">And I would say: that&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.340" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">And its actually a place that&#39;s well documented in ...</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.060" end="00:30:16.500" style="s2">...clasic , religious  and mitological  stories</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.520" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">Thats Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:19.020" style="s2">The Daoists , for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.060" end="00:30:21.500" style="s2">They believe  that the world is made out of Chaos and Order</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.960" end="00:30:25.860" style="s2">Order : that&#39;s where you are when what you do gets you what you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.520" end="00:30:27.180" style="s2">Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.120" end="00:30:30.940" style="s2">That&#39;s where you are when you have not idea what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.940" end="00:30:32.120" style="s2">And you might ask: well</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:34.940" style="s2">Is there a way that you should act when you in Chaos?</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:37.540" style="s2">And the anwer to that is : there better be</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.540" end="00:30:40.840" style="s2">Because it&#39;s a place you going to visit several times during your life</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.380" end="00:30:43.320" style="s2">And everyone visits that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.900" end="00:30:45.880" style="s2">That&#39;s why it&#39;s an archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.880" end="00:30:47.920" style="s2">Thats the descent to the underground</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.920" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">Underground is that horrible place that lurks underneath all our presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.420" end="00:30:54.140" style="s2">Its the...</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.140" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">...frigid lake underneath thin ice that everybody is skating on</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.580" end="00:31:01.280" style="s2">And is something that can manifest itself at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.280" end="00:31:05.060" style="s2">Tha&#39;ts , probably why in the Dao&#39;s  symbol the black paisley is Chaos, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.080" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">and the white pisley is Order</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:10.560" style="s2">In the  Order paisley, there is the little black dot</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.560" end="00:31:14.540" style="s2">Thats because Order can change into Chaos , and  does,  at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:18.200" style="s2">And the revers is also true</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.200" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">Chaos can turn into Order at any moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:21.720" style="s2">And inside will do that for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.860" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">You know; alcoholics report that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.900" end="00:31:27.920" style="s2">When they hit bottom is like &quot; Khh&quot;  there is the catalyses and they look at the world in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.220" end="00:31:30.380" style="s2">You know; now they are new person</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.380" end="00:31:31.700" style="s2">They back from the underground</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.700" end="00:31:34.440" style="s2">They&#39;ve risen from the dead, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.440" end="00:31:39.000" style="s2">You know; and it&#39;s partly because what looks like your right hemisphereis pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.320" end="00:31:43.960" style="s2">Infering patterns in novel and chaotic places;</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.960" end="00:31:46.680" style="s2">It&#39;s, kind of, keeping track of things that happened to you that are anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.680" end="00:31:49.740" style="s2">And it makes alternatives maps of the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.780" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">That are there for you to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.300" style="s2">At least to some degree if that ever becomes necessary</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.980" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">Now, you might ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:00.680" style="s2">How upset should you be  when something that you don&#39;t expect happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.680" end="00:32:03.860" style="s2">Now, it turns out that that&#39;s is really a difficult question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.860" end="00:32:08.060" style="s2">Because, what the problem is that when something you dont expect happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.060" end="00:32:09.620" style="s2">You don&#39;t know what it is!</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.620" end="00:32:13.380" style="s2">And so, then you might say &quot;well, how upset should you get?&quot; and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.520" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">You don&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.780" end="00:32:18.220" style="s2">And so what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.220" end="00:32:21.500" style="s2">First of all you &#39;ve got some build in approximators</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.660" end="00:32:23.340" style="s2">One would be...your...</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.380" end="00:32:28.340" style="s2">Geneticaly determined level of nuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.340" end="00:32:30.820" style="s2">Which is basicaly sensitivity to negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.820" end="00:32:37.080" style="s2">If you more sensitive to negative emotion, you gonna manifest more psycho-phisiological preperation</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.080" end="00:32:39.460" style="s2">Per unit of treat or uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.460" end="00:32:42.920" style="s2">Which is to say some people get more upset about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.920" end="00:32:43.620" style="s2">Than other people do!</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.740" end="00:32:44.860" style="s2">Now who is right?</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.980" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">Well....</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.300" end="00:32:47.020" style="s2">Who knows?</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.020" end="00:32:49.340" style="s2">You wake up in the morning and there is a little ache in your side</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.340" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well, what is that?</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.860" end="00:32:52.700" style="s2">it&#39;s sore muscle or cancer?</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.780" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">You don&#39;t know!</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.660" end="00:32:56.260" style="s2">And if you hipochondrical , well its gonna be cancer!</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.340" end="00:32:57.300" style="s2">And sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.320" end="00:32:59.020" style="s2">The hypochondriac is right!</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.020" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">And so he is the one that lives when it goes to the emergency room</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:04.060" style="s2">And finds out exactly wha&#39;ts going on</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.060" end="00:33:06.260" style="s2">So its an ununswerable question</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.460" end="00:33:09.540" style="s2">Now, the other way that your brain determins how upset you should be is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.540" end="00:33:12.140" style="s2">By calculating your position on the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.140" end="00:33:14.520" style="s2">Because the higher you are on the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.520" end="00:33:16.460" style="s2">The more resorces you have at your disposal</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.460" end="00:33:20.160" style="s2">And so , the less upset you have to get when anything horrible happens</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.160" end="00:33:23.720" style="s2">So if you berely clinging to the bottom of the social structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.720" end="00:33:27.680" style="s2">You can be sure that your brain is going to estimate any anomalous occurance as a catastrophy</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.680" end="00:33:31.540" style="s2">Which is why people don&#39;t like being at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.640" end="00:33:35.000" style="s2">And is also why people who are there die a lot sooner</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.460" end="00:33:37.700" style="s2">And they do.. they die a lot sooner</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.040" style="s2">Regardless of their absolute level of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.680" end="00:33:44.300" style="s2">It&#39;s relative deprivation that counts</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.420" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">Ok, so here is a bit of a clue about how else your brain might calculate</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.520" end="00:33:50.220" style="s2">How upset you should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.220" end="00:33:53.620" style="s2">Here is a little map of me when I&#39;m doing something</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.620" end="00:33:55.980" style="s2">That I frequently do; which is to write a manuscripts</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.060" end="00:33:59.160" style="s2">So you might say &quot; What are you doing when you&#39;re writing a manuscript?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.160" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">And that turns out to be a very complicated question</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:04.440" style="s2">It&#39;s like &quot;What you&#39;re doing when you read a book?</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">Well...</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:08.640" style="s2">You&#39;re writting letters or typing them</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.740" end="00:34:11.380" style="s2">You&#39;re typing words, you typing frases</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.380" end="00:34:12.740" style="s2">You&#39;re typping sentences</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.740" end="00:34:14.060" style="s2">You&#39;re typing paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.260" end="00:34:18.900" style="s2">You&#39;re typing the structure that the paragraphs fit in to- that&#39;s will be the essay</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.080" end="00:34:19.580" style="s2">Ok?</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.020" end="00:34:21.060" style="s2">Then you&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.900" end="00:34:27.120" style="s2">Me, anyways, I&#39;m practising science because I usually write some scientific manusripts</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.160" end="00:34:30.060" style="s2">And that&#39;s part of embodying my profesorial</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.060" end="00:34:31.820" style="s2">Role and then that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.820" end="00:34:34.280" style="s2">Hypoteticaly, being a productive citizen</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.280" end="00:34:35.380" style="s2">Or  thou, some of you might...</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.420" end="00:34:35.980" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.980" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">differ to that , given that I&#39;m a professor</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.740" end="00:34:38.300" style="s2">And then</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:40.220" style="s2">Perhaps on outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.220" end="00:34:44.040" style="s2">This is what I think is on the outside of that is : I&#39;m confronting the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.880" end="00:34:46.640" style="s2">And you might say , well...</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:49.920" style="s2">What are you really doing when you&#39;re writting a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.980" end="00:34:52.640" style="s2">And the answer to that is : you&#39;re doing all of this things better or worst</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.640" end="00:34:56.100" style="s2">And if you&#39;re doing realy good job of writing your sentence you&#39;re doing all of them at once</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.100" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">And thst would be one of the things that would make the sentence particularly meanningful</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.800" end="00:35:00.300" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">If something anomalous occurs  , let say , the letter &quot;T&quot; on my typewritergets stuck,</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:09.060" style="s2">Well thats gonna irritate me because then I can;t type the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.060" end="00:35:11.580" style="s2">Now it&#39;s not gonna irritate me too much because, you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.580" end="00:35:15.560" style="s2">It does&#39;t realy interfiere with my ability to be a productive citizen</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:17.760" style="s2">So, I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.280" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">Estimate</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">The magnitude of how upset I should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">When something unknown occures</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.560" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">By estimating where in the hierarchy of action that anomaly is dysruptive</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:32.860" style="s2">Ok, so, let me run you through this again</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:34.520" style="s2">So lets say :</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:36.660" style="s2">What&#39;s  &quot; a good person?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.660" end="00:35:39.100" style="s2">And you might think of that from the objective perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.140" end="00:35:40.900" style="s2">But that would be a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.120" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">Because</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.800" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">A quality , like good , is a pragmatic quality</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.900" end="00:35:47.480" style="s2">If it&#39;s based on action, not on object</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.480" end="00:35:50.580" style="s2">So , here is how you decompose being a good person</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.220" end="00:35:51.720" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.200" end="00:35:56.920" style="s2">A good person is a good parent; more than that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.920" end="00:35:58.120" style="s2">That&#39;s the subcomponent, right?</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.120" end="00:36:01.460" style="s2">A good parent is someone who has a job and takes care of the family</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.460" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">And then, the person who takes care of their family is like</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">They can play with the baby</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.960" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">Or they can complete the meal</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:08.900" style="s2">This are abstract concepts</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.900" end="00:36:11.260" style="s2">You can&#39;t tell the four year old &quot; Make a meal&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.260" end="00:36:15.100" style="s2">And the reason you can;t is because they dont know  the subordinate components of making the meal</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:17.460" style="s2">You can say: &quot; See that fork?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.200" end="00:36:20.040" style="s2">Hopefully they know what the fork is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.200" end="00:36:26.260" style="s2">&quot;See that fork?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Pick up that fork and bring that fork to the table and put it there&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.260" end="00:36:27.300" style="s2">They can do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.300" end="00:36:29.740" style="s2">Because their nervous system is organaised enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.740" end="00:36:31.640" style="s2">To operate at that level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.780" end="00:36:33.700" style="s2">But they can&#39;t do something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.700" end="00:36:34.680" style="s2">&quot;Make a meal&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.680" end="00:36:38.220" style="s2">Which is, you know, if you got a three year old you can&#39;t put them in their room and you say:</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.220" end="00:36:39.060" style="s2">&quot;Clean up your room!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.220" end="00:36:40.260" style="s2">They will just look at you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.260" end="00:36:42.660" style="s2">And then when you come back in half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.660" end="00:36:44.060" style="s2">They will look at you again!</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.200" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">You can say: &quot;Hey! Kid ! See that Teddy Bear?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:49.060" style="s2">&quot;Yeh&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.060" end="00:36:52.520" style="s2">&quot;Pick up the Teddy Bear, and put it on that space in the wall&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.520" end="00:36:56.080" style="s2">And than once you teach the three years old how to do a hundred of those things</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.080" end="00:36:56.840" style="s2">And they got it</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.840" end="00:36:58.580" style="s2">They&#39;ve got a little motor rutines</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.580" end="00:37:00.420" style="s2">You can say&quot; Clean the room&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.420" end="00:37:02.120" style="s2">You can encapsulate that entire set</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.120" end="00:37:04.540" style="s2">Of motor rutines within the higher order of the concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.660" end="00:37:06.740" style="s2">So if your&quot;Being a good person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.740" end="00:37:07.460" style="s2">Part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.460" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">Well, maybe you&#39;re making a meal and the part of that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:11.420" style="s2">Well, you&#39;re cutting up the vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.140" end="00:37:15.300" style="s2">But then the things get interesting because when you are cutting up the vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.300" end="00:37:18.212" style="s2">What you actually doing is are ripping something and moving</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.220" end="00:37:20.180" style="s2">And than thats no longer abstract</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.260" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">Right? Thats where your conceptual philosopfical presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">Like being a good person hit the roo...</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:31.820" style="s2">Hit the ...hit the level of embodied material reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.840" end="00:37:35.180" style="s2">That&#39;s the disolution of the mind into the body</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.780" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.100" end="00:37:39.700" style="s2">If someone says to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.700" end="00:37:42.440" style="s2">&quot;You should cut those vegetables more thinly&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.100" end="00:37:44.700" style="s2">That might irritate you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.940" end="00:37:46.120" style="s2">But if they say</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.120" end="00:37:47.900" style="s2">&quot; You are bad parent&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.080" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">Maybe observing the same phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:52.620" style="s2">Then you&#39;re going to a fight with them</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.100" end="00:37:55.900" style="s2">And so, the reason for that is , obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.900" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">If it&#39;s just a matter of cutting the vegetables thinner</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">All you have to do is make a minor modification in the hierarchy that constitudes yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:06.900" style="s2">Representation or, realy, yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.900" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">iT&#39;s not juet a representation</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">But if you are not a good parent , it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:12.900" style="s2">If that&#39;s true you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.240" end="00:38:14.580" style="s2">You&#39;ve got a lot of repare work to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.580" end="00:38:17.340" style="s2">A lot of your world is falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.600" end="00:38:20.540" style="s2">And as soon as things fall apart , which they always do</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.540" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">You&#39;re in chaos and as soon as you are in chaos than</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">Your body defaults to  emergency preparation and your&#39;re stressed</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">And  if you&#39;re stressed long enough then you die</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.580" end="00:38:31.480" style="s2">And so, you don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.480" end="00:38:33.580" style="s2">Stress say, when  your body  gets stressed...</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.580" end="00:38:38.360" style="s2">What happens is;  because it doesn&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on it prepares for everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:41.560" style="s2">That&#39;s the general stress response, cortisol production does that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.560" end="00:38:44.540" style="s2">Cortisol production is good, it wakes you up in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.540" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">But if it&#39;s chronic, you get old</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.740" end="00:38:49.000" style="s2">Like it&#39;s so...</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.780" end="00:38:51.620" style="s2">...general in it&#39;s negative...</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.620" end="00:38:56.700" style="s2">...actions. That the best way to conceptualise its detrimental long term effect</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.700" end="00:38:58.260" style="s2">that its excelerating ageing</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.260" end="00:39:02.940" style="s2">So, it makes you more likely to have heart desease, and cancer, and  depresion, and Altzheimers</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.300" end="00:39:04.200" style="s2">And...</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.060" end="00:39:07.980" style="s2">Diabetes and obesity</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.860" end="00:39:09.740" style="s2">That will do.</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.500" end="00:39:11.380" style="s2">It&#39;s enough!</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.420" end="00:39:13.660" style="s2">Any of those are enough to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.340" end="00:39:15.060" style="s2">All right!</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.060" end="00:39:16.280" style="s2">So there is a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.280" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">That&#39;s the hierarchy of values</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.360" end="00:39:20.360" style="s2">The higher the values the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.360" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">the less you wanna have it desrupted! Now...</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.660" end="00:39:27.220" style="s2">There is psychologist named Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.700" end="00:39:29.980" style="s2">Some of  you might know about him</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.660" end="00:39:35.660" style="s2">Piaget was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.460" end="00:39:38.920" style="s2">What happens to value structures</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.920" end="00:39:40.900" style="s2">And the hierarchical organisation</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:45.500" style="s2">Once they have to apply outside of the confouds of the body</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.500" end="00:39:47.360" style="s2">So, so here is the way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.360" end="00:39:49.460" style="s2">Two years olds-basicaly hypothalamic</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.460" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">Thats why they so much fun!</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:53.600" style="s2">First they happy, then they sad, then they hungry, then they tired</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.600" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">You know, they just zip from one pretty straight forward and rather all inspiring motivational state</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.800" end="00:40:00.680" style="s2">To another</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">And by they- two, they can&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:05.400" style="s2">They will play by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.960" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">But they can&#39;t play with other children</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:09.580" style="s2">They can&#39;t get that until they three</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.580" end="00:40:11.405" style="s2">And they need to get it by the time they three</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.405" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">Because if they don&#39;t get it  by the time they four</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:14.940" style="s2">They will never get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.940" end="00:40:19.000" style="s2">And then you have an antisocial kid who is going to be outsider for his entire life</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:21.260" style="s2">And there isn&#39;t anything you can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.260" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">So,that has to happen between two and four</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.480" end="00:40:25.620" style="s2">So what happends about age  three is that the kid learns</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.620" end="00:40:27.420" style="s2">How to play a game with another person</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.420" end="00:40:31.620" style="s2">And what that game is, is fundamentally the developement of the ability</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.620" end="00:40:34.020" style="s2">To share a frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.020" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">Which is what you&#39;re doing when you play Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:38.220" style="s2">It&#39;s like its stupid to play Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.260" end="00:40:38.980" style="s2">Obviously</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.980" end="00:40:42.520" style="s2">Who cares if you have a whole pile of counterfeit paper</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.780" end="00:40:43.380" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.560" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">But doesn&#39;t matter because the way you constituted is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">Your brain will treat anything you act</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.440" end="00:40:51.000" style="s2">...like...</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.000" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">Constitutes a valuable goal as if it&#39;s a valid framework of reference</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:41:00.820" style="s2">And if it could&#39;t do that: A-you couldn&#39;t abstract, and B-you could not get along with another people</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.820" end="00:41:05.260" style="s2">So you can sit arounde the table and you can say &quot;Lets pretend that...</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.260" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">...Monopoly is a reasonable facsimile of reality&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">Which you would&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:11.220" style="s2">But it&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.220" end="00:41:15.420" style="s2">And everybody says: &quot;Yes, that would be amusing!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.600" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">And so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.820" end="00:41:21.620" style="s2">Than you say your goal : which is to get a little hotels and all the many</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.620" end="00:41:23.780" style="s2">And Puf! Your emotions go along for the ride!</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:25.540" style="s2">And whats so interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.600" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">You can get everybody in to the game</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.900" end="00:41:29.400" style="s2">And so one of the things that&#39;s realy interesting about people</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.400" end="00:41:33.060" style="s2">Is that we can establish a shared fictional frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.060" end="00:41:35.940" style="s2">And it organises all our emotions so they are predictable</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.940" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">That&#39;s also why we can watch movies!</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.380" end="00:41:40.820" style="s2">You go to the movie you identify the Hero</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.820" end="00:41:42.300" style="s2">You figure  out whet the Hero wants</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.360" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">Puf! You&#39;re the hero!</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:45.660" style="s2">And the way that works is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.660" end="00:41:51.500" style="s2">You don&#39;t look at the Hero, and think about what is he doing, and evaluate emotionaly, and then feel it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:56.440" style="s2">What you do is you specify the hero&#39;s goal and then you map him on to  your body</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.500" end="00:41:59.060" style="s2">And you read of the emotional responses of your own body</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.060" end="00:42:01.560" style="s2">And that&#39;s how you understand the hero</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.420" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">So, it&#39;s embodied ...</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.440" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">You&#39;re using your embodiment as a...</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.720" style="s2">Computational devise that can run simulations of other consciousnes</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.720" end="00:42:13.560" style="s2">And it does that with the body</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.560" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">And we like doing that!</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:16.280" style="s2">You can go to the movie and , you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.420" end="00:42:17.140" style="s2">You&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.240" end="00:42:19.540" style="s2">Brad Pitt for an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.560" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">You know, when you&#39;re Brad Pitt doing remarkable things</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:25.360" style="s2">And that&#39;s also how we understand other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.360" end="00:42:28.520" style="s2">We&#39;re very good at that , so, anyways, we have this share frames of reference</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.520" end="00:42:30.360" style="s2">Like when we&#39; re playing Monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.460" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">Ok, so</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:33.100" style="s2">Children at three learn how to play games</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.100" end="00:42:37.700" style="s2">And that means they  learn how to organise they own internal motivational  states</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.700" end="00:42:41.820" style="s2">Into a hierarchythat includes the motivational states of other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.460" end="00:42:44.300" style="s2">And that means they can play</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.300" end="00:42:46.340" style="s2">And that&#39;s what you guys do when you out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.340" end="00:42:48.040" style="s2">Like, we&#39;re playing the game right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.040" end="00:42:48.980" style="s2">We all know the rules</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.980" end="00:42:53.140" style="s2">Thats whay we can all sit in this room and play the game without fighting with each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.140" end="00:42:57.420" style="s2">You know, and the room is set up like a theatre and we all know thw theatre game</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.420" end="00:43:00.600" style="s2">And so, and the chairs are all facing this way at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.600" end="00:43:02.520" style="s2">And so that&#39;s a hint that you should look forward</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.520" end="00:43:04.260" style="s2">And this is raised so ...</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.260" end="00:43:06.920" style="s2">You know, the room is basicaly telling you what to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.060" end="00:43:09.300" style="s2">Because is a stage, like all rooms</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.300" end="00:43:13.400" style="s2">And because you&#39;re smart and socialy conscious you can walk into a stage room</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.400" end="00:43:15.320" style="s2">And your body knows what to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">And if you civilised and social</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:19.560" style="s2">You just do it, than all the other primates can predict</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.560" end="00:43:21.900" style="s2">What you&#39;re up to, and they won&#39;t kill you!</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.320" end="00:43:26.680" style="s2">Ye! That&#39;s what it means to be part of the same tribe</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.680" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">You know, when people are very peculiar creatures</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">And God only knows what&#39;re they up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:33.236" style="s2">But as long as the&#39;re playing the same  game you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.240" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to know what&#39;s they up to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:36.920" style="s2">Because you can predict what are they going to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.920" end="00:43:39.220" style="s2">And you understand  they motivational states</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.620" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">And so, part of the building and constructing of higher order of ...higher order..moral ...</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.780" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">...goals, is the establishment of joint frames of reference</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:55.060" style="s2">That allow multiple people to  persue the goals that they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.060" end="00:43:56.300" style="s2">Simultaneously!</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.300" end="00:43:59.060" style="s2">And than, what you have to  think about with regards to that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.060" end="00:44:02.700" style="s2">That not all shared frames of reference can manage that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.700" end="00:44:04.600" style="s2">There is a small subset of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.600" end="00:44:08.380" style="s2">That are optimised, so that not only can multiple people play them</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.680" end="00:44:11.880" style="s2">But muliple people can play them, and enjoy them</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.880" end="00:44:15.000" style="s2">And do it repetedl across a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.000" end="00:44:20.740" style="s2">So it&#39;s inner abillity that partly defines  the utility of a higher order moral structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">And that is not that arbitrary!</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.140" end="00:44:26.500" style="s2">It&#39;s the emerging property of biological interactions</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.500" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">And you might say &quot; Well it&#39;s kind of arbitrary because people can do what they want&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.920" end="00:44:31.360" style="s2">But it&#39;s not arbitrary at all!</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.360" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">Because a lot of what constraining your games</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:36.040" style="s2">Is your motivational substructure</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.040" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">And those ancient circuits that are status oriented</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.300" end="00:44:40.900" style="s2">And they operate within</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.800" end="00:44:45.160" style="s2">Virtualy every animal has a status  counter</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.160" end="00:44:48.420" style="s2">Creatures organise themselves into dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.420" end="00:44:50.620" style="s2">the reason they do that is because that works</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.620" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">It&#39;s a solution, it&#39;s a solution to the Darwinian problem of existance</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.840" end="00:44:57.840" style="s2">It&#39;s not just a epiphenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.940" end="00:44:59.220" style="s2">It&#39;s the real thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.560" end="00:45:00.060" style="s2">So</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.060" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">You, your enviroment fundamentaly, a huge chunk of your enviroment is dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:07.300" style="s2">Plus &quot;God only knows wher you are&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">And that&#39;s Order and Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:12.540" style="s2">And part of the reason that people fight to preserve the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.540" end="00:45:16.260" style="s2">Is because it&#39;s better to be a slave who knows what the hell is going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.260" end="00:45:20.340" style="s2">Then someone who is thrown screaming, and naked in to the jungle at night</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.340" end="00:45:23.100" style="s2">And that&#39;s the difference between Order and Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.100" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">And, we like order better than chaos and it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.680" end="00:45:28.760" style="s2">Now we&#39;ll invite a liitle chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.760" end="00:45:30.480" style="s2">For entertament now and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.480" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">But has to be done voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:36.700" style="s2">And generally you don&#39;t want the kind of chaos that upsets your entire conceptual structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.700" end="00:45:39.800" style="s2">You know, you&#39;re willing to full around on a fringes a little bit but...</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.800" end="00:45:43.460" style="s2">...you know, when your going gets serious you&#39;re pretty much likely to bailout</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.660" end="00:45:44.540" style="s2">And no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.580" end="00:45:49.140" style="s2">Now I want to tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:51.840" style="s2">This chaotic domain</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:54.140" style="s2">I can tell you a couple of yhings about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.400" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">It&#39;s the underworld of mitology</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">One of the things that kind of interesting about the underworld is</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:04.700" style="s2">That it has a suburband one of the suburbs of the underworld is Hell</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.260" end="00:46:07.980" style="s2">And Hell is the place where you end up when</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:11.120" style="s2">Everything that you know falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.120" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">And you get resentful and bitter about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.480" style="s2">And that&#39;s very like, one of the things that I noticed in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.480" end="00:46:21.880" style="s2">Work as a clinical psychologistis that, there&#39;s two things that realy do people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.180" end="00:46:22.680" style="s2">Three</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.680" end="00:46:24.200" style="s2">Lying, that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.660" end="00:46:26.580" style="s2">Apart from that:  resentment</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:28.120" style="s2">And arogance!</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.280" end="00:46:30.040" style="s2">If you get resenful enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">You and up like Eliot Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.060" end="00:46:35.460" style="s2">And all those other people who go on  rundom shootings sprees</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.460" end="00:46:39.260" style="s2">Because they have a disagreement about the structure  of existence</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.260" end="00:46:42.920" style="s2">And the fact that they anded up hypothetically at the bottom of the heap</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.920" end="00:46:47.480" style="s2">So those are real places and people gets stuck in them, and they are not places that you would</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:50.540" style="s2">Voluntarily choose to go if you had any sens  at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.540" end="00:46:53.080" style="s2">And I tell you if you read the accounts</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.140" end="00:46:55.780" style="s2">Of the people who do rundom mass-murder</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.780" end="00:46:58.120" style="s2">they will tell you exactly where they  are</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.120" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">And they will tell you exactly what they motivated to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:05.580" style="s2">And what they motivated to do is take as much revenge on existence as they possibly can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.580" end="00:47:07.500" style="s2">In the most unfaire possible way</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:10.100" style="s2">As fast as they can possibly manage it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:14.360" style="s2">And that&#39;s the conscious aim and is not a form of insanity</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.360" end="00:47:16.140" style="s2">They know exactly what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.600" end="00:47:19.800" style="s2">They have precisely idea what are they aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.840" end="00:47:21.840" style="s2">And it&#39;s a deep archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.500" end="00:47:23.220" style="s2">Posession</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.220" end="00:47:24.580" style="s2">Per lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.500" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">Now</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.200" end="00:47:33.320" style="s2">I wanna show you how some of this things are maped</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.040" end="00:47:37.000" style="s2">Symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.880" end="00:47:42.600" style="s2">They&#39;re not realy symbols, in my estimation, because  a symbol implies</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">That something is being</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.240" end="00:47:46.340" style="s2">Represented</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.340" end="00:47:50.540" style="s2">You know, there is reality  behind the representation that&#39;s broader than the representation</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.540" end="00:47:52.380" style="s2">And the symbol is just a shadow of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.380" end="00:47:53.660" style="s2">This aren&#39;t symbols</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.660" end="00:47:57.460" style="s2">They&#39;re representations that are exact  as they can possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.200" end="00:48:08.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll start with something that is rather easy to understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.980" end="00:48:10.540" style="s2">Lets try</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.060" end="00:48:16.560" style="s2">Yes!</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.220" end="00:48:20.020" style="s2">what happends when you look at the Medusa?</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.840" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">You turn to stone!</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:25.220" style="s2">What happends when a rabbits sees a wolf?</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:28.560" style="s2">That&#39;s right, it turns  to stone</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.820" end="00:48:30.500" style="s2">That&#39;s right, the Medusa</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.620" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">Is a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.040" end="00:48:33.560" style="s2">It&#39;s a representation</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.560" end="00:48:36.940" style="s2">Of all those things that make you turn to stone when you look at them</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.620" end="00:48:38.260" style="s2">Now look!</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.420" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">Animals can deal with treat</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:40.980" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.980" end="00:48:43.320" style="s2">They have instincts to deal with treat</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.320" end="00:48:46.840" style="s2">But zebras, maybe there is a bunch of zebras then they out there in herd</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.580" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:50.100" style="s2">There is a bunch of lions and they right there</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.100" end="00:48:51.580" style="s2">And the zebras : what are they doing ?</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.640" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">They graizing.</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:48:55.860" style="s2">And you think: &quot;Whow! Those zebras aren&#39;t very bright because there is a bunch of lions</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.860" end="00:49:00.220" style="s2">Like why aren&#39;t they , you know, in the forest building a fort to keep the lions out</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.220" end="00:49:04.520" style="s2">But, the reason they&#39;re not doing that is because although they can react to threat</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.660" end="00:49:09.360" style="s2">They can not conceive of the class of threatening objects</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.180" end="00:49:14.460" style="s2">Now human being can conceive of the class of threatening objects</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.460" end="00:49:17.860" style="s2">And so, what&#39;s civilization is in a large part is an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.860" end="00:49:20.820" style="s2">To find the remedy for the class of threatning objects</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.820" end="00:49:23.600" style="s2">Now there are representations of those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.600" end="00:49:24.780" style="s2">The Medusa is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.780" end="00:49:29.580" style="s2">The reason is feminine is very difficult to explainand I don&#39;t think Ihave the time  unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.580" end="00:49:32.340" style="s2">But you have to take my word for it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.340" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">You see the little cartoon of Robert Crumb after a left there?</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.700" end="00:49:37.620" style="s2">Hi&#39;s got a big Oedpal problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.960" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">Old Rob Crumb</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:41.260" style="s2">And the problem with him fundamentaly is</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.260" end="00:49:46.080" style="s2">That his mother was something like a gigant spider and did everything what she possibly could to cross the  life out of him</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.140" end="00:49:48.840" style="s2">Hence his remining relationship with women</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.140" end="00:49:52.580" style="s2">And so thats partly the reason why femininity can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.600" end="00:49:57.080" style="s2">Something that&#39;s turnes you to stone</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.080" end="00:49:59.400" style="s2">It&#39;s an experiemce that many man are familiar with  by the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.400" end="00:50:03.620" style="s2">Because the average man is rejected far more often then he is accepted</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.620" end="00:50:06.680" style="s2">And since women are the gateway to reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.000" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">They constitute nature itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:12.040" style="s2">And nature itself tells most man</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.040" end="00:50:14.120" style="s2">That you should go home and stay under your bed</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.240" end="00:50:19.560" style="s2">There is lots of experiments done about this so for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.560" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">Psychologists have undergraduated woman go out into the concours</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">And see how long it takes someone - her to find someone to agree to sleep with her</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">And that takes , you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.740" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">Two seconds after she asks the first man</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.860" end="00:50:33.420" style="s2">And then</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.340" end="00:50:35.780" style="s2">And then they flip it!</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.780" end="00:50:38.740" style="s2">You know, and they get randome undergraduate guy to do the same things</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.740" end="00:50:41.220" style="s2">and you can imagine the consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.220" end="00:50:43.880" style="s2">Since many of you man have lived through it</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.020" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">Mother nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.860" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">Well, the woman weares the face of Mother Nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.900" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">And the face is generaly rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:55.640" style="s2">Especialy the man who are lower on the dominance hierarchy by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.640" end="00:50:58.440" style="s2">Which is one of the things that irritates guys like Elliot Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.440" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">And one of the things that motivates  their desire to take revenge</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">That&#39;s the universal phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:05.580" style="s2">So that&#39;s part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.580" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">The feminine is nature and why nature by the way is Mother Nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.840" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.840" end="00:51:14.040" style="s2">It&#39;s diagnosis of your status is not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.100" end="00:51:14.980" style="s2">And no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.800" end="00:51:21.600" style="s2">What seams to have happend fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.940" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">Is that this domains that  I talked to you about</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:27.360" style="s2">Which can be represented as Chaos and Order</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.360" end="00:51:33.360" style="s2">We say in our, fom the Daoist&#39;s perspective, can also be represented as musculine and feminin</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.720" end="00:51:36.040" style="s2">And I think the reason for it is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:40.200" style="s2">Human beings their fundamentally social primates, right?</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.200" end="00:51:41.320" style="s2">We&#39;re very very social</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.660" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">And we know that one of the corelates of brain size in primates is social group size</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.020" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">And we also know that  the most primates, say chimps who we are quite closely related to</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.860" style="s2">They don&#39;t like go out and invenstigate  leaves and you know pear at things through the microscope</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.860" end="00:51:58.040" style="s2">they spend all their time interacting with other chimpanzies</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.040" end="00:52:02.440" style="s2">Although they chewing all the time , they have to do it because they have a rediculously inefective</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.440" end="00:52:04.740" style="s2">You know, digestive and eating system</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.460" end="00:52:09.980" style="s2">Their brain is adapted</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.460" end="00:52:14.560" style="s2">To the social circumstances as the primary reality so you could say</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.560" end="00:52:20.820" style="s2">Well tribe is the primary reality and there is the secondary reality which is all that wich is outside tribe</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.820" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2">And that&#39;s corresponds to Chaos and Order</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.780" end="00:52:31.120" style="s2">Order in contradiction to Chaos is symbolised by masculine symbols</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.160" end="00:52:35.240" style="s2">And that&#39;s for example why ideologies like radical feminism</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.240" end="00:52:38.080" style="s2">Presume  the existence of a patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.080" end="00:52:40.380" style="s2">It fits in to a symbolic structure of our minds that idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.420" end="00:52:43.120" style="s2">And it is true in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.300" end="00:52:47.580" style="s2">Just like a chimpanzie troups, the proper primary or metahierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.580" end="00:52:52.380" style="s2">That makes up human civilization is fundamentaly masculine in its origin  and structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.380" end="00:52:55.800" style="s2">And so, masculine is fundamentaly the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.800" end="00:52:58.255" style="s2">And feminine is fundamentally all the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.260" end="00:53:01.380" style="s2">That are outside or the chalenge the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.620" end="00:53:04.100" style="s2">And so, it is the perfectly reasonable...its wierd...</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.180" end="00:53:07.640" style="s2">Because our brain is organised to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.780" end="00:53:11.380" style="s2">Fundamentaly aprechend world in terms of the personalities</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.380" end="00:53:13.060" style="s2">And that&#39;s partly because , you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.060" end="00:53:15.780" style="s2">As we emerged of over the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.780" end="00:53:20.080" style="s2">It&#39;s been relatively constant that there are males around and the there were females around</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.080" end="00:53:23.580" style="s2">And then the males were fathers and the females were mothers</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.700" end="00:53:26.500" style="s2">And , you know , they were both mates as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.500" end="00:53:28.740" style="s2">That&#39;s the constant of the evolutionary landscape</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.740" end="00:53:30.660" style="s2">And that&#39;s what our brain evolved to process</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.660" end="00:53:36.560" style="s2">And then what happened when we develop the capacity to abstruct is we use this underlying</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.600" end="00:53:43.600" style="s2">Social cognitive abstraction  structure to start to represent the structure of being itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.600" end="00:53:47.500" style="s2">so we can say: &quot;Well, there is dominance hierarchy and that&#39;s society</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.500" end="00:53:50.980" style="s2">And that&#39;s masculine and there is all the things that challenge the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.980" end="00:53:53.100" style="s2">And they&#39;re outside and they are feminine</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.220" end="00:53:55.780" style="s2">The weirdest thing about that however</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.800" end="00:53:57.480" style="s2">Is that it actually works</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.480" end="00:54:02.280" style="s2">You know, we&#39;ve got away with that for some reason which seams to be practicaly reasinable</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.280" end="00:54:04.220" style="s2">To map the world in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.520" end="00:54:05.640" style="s2">It keeps us going</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:19.420" style="s2">All right, I&#39;m gonna try to explain this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.480" end="00:54:21.520" style="s2">This is now chemical symbol</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.860" end="00:54:26.700" style="s2">At the bottom of this symbol</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:29.120" style="s2">There is this round thing with wings</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.300" end="00:54:32.220" style="s2">Do you ever see Harry Potter ?</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.900" end="00:54:33.400" style="s2">Ye...</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">You know the game &quot;Quidditch&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.800" end="00:54:37.800" style="s2">You remember what they chase?</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.800" end="00:54:39.660" style="s2">They chase the gold one of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.280" end="00:54:41.400" style="s2">All right, so...</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.400" end="00:54:43.220" style="s2">They call that the snitch I believe</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.220" end="00:54:44.980" style="s2">And there is a little fragment of soul in</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.980" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">It&#39;s very interesting idea because</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.920" end="00:54:50.520" style="s2">For the alchemists the primary element of reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.560" end="00:54:53.560" style="s2">Whatever that was could be conceptualised as this thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.580" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">This round Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.840" end="00:54:57.800" style="s2">And what is was conceptualised of, in part, was</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.800" end="00:55:01.880" style="s2">It was a container from which matter and spirit could emerge</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.880" end="00:55:04.360" style="s2">And you might ask &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.140" end="00:55:06.580" style="s2">This is what it means:</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:13.360" style="s2">When a child experiences something it can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">It does the thing that led to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.700" end="00:55:17.980" style="s2">Uncertain outcome</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.980" end="00:55:19.420" style="s2">Over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:20.920" style="s2">Until it can map it</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.240" end="00:55:23.260" style="s2">And than you think &quot;What will the child do?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.260" end="00:55:27.740" style="s2">What the child did was take the domain of that which it did not understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.860" end="00:55:33.400" style="s2">And it transformed it into matter, which is the predictable world of entities and spirit</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.400" end="00:55:37.180" style="s2">Which is the internal pssychological structure that is adapted to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.180" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">And so, whats the alchemists basically conceptualised was that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.380" end="00:55:47.640" style="s2">What exists outside of your conceptual framework is something like</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.020" end="00:55:49.540" style="s2">Unrealised potential</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.540" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">And when you interact with that unrealised potential you actualise it</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:55.720" style="s2">And you actualise it in to two component elements</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.720" end="00:55:58.520" style="s2">One being:the material world and the other being</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.580" end="00:56:00.120" style="s2">You own psychological structure</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.220" end="00:56:03.580" style="s2">That&#39;s why they conceptualised matter and spirit</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.580" end="00:56:06.780" style="s2">The container of matter and spirit as the ultimate reality</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.780" end="00:56:09.420" style="s2">And out all of that emerged something that was quite primodial</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.420" end="00:56:10.300" style="s2">Which is the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.100" end="00:56:11.600" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:14.560" style="s2">One of the things we know</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.940" end="00:56:17.780" style="s2">Remember the Genesis story?</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:22.520" style="s2">It&#39;s the snake that gives people vision</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.680" end="00:56:23.460" style="s2">Remember that?</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.100" end="00:56:27.600" style="s2">It gives them wisdom and also produces self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.280" end="00:56:33.060" style="s2">There is women named Lynne Isbell, who is the anthropologist in LA</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.060" end="00:56:35.420" style="s2">And she was very interested in human being&#39;s  sight</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.420" end="00:56:36.500" style="s2">Because we can realy see</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.500" end="00:56:39.900" style="s2">We can see better than any other creature, exept predatory birds</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.900" end="00:56:42.420" style="s2">We can see way better than most primates</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.620" end="00:56:48.520" style="s2">Is thou  new that our tree dwelling ancestors, some 60 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.620" end="00:56:51.100" style="s2">Emerged at about the same time as snakes</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.100" end="00:56:52.440" style="s2">Thery&#39;re younger...</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.440" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">than lizards, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:58.340" style="s2">And than we were preyed on quite intensely by snakes for tens of millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.340" end="00:57:02.260" style="s2">She also knew that we were good at detecting snakes at the bottom of our visual field</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.260" end="00:57:04.180" style="s2">And that we were particulary good at detecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.180" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">The camouflage patternes of snakes at the bottom of our visual field</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">So, she did a series of field experiments showing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.900" end="00:57:12.720" style="s2">Primate visual acuity was</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.060" end="00:57:17.420" style="s2">Correlated strongly with the presence of preditory snakes in the immediate enviroment</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.280" end="00:57:18.940" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.460" end="00:57:21.540" style="s2">The idea that snakes gave us vision</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.720" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">Is right !</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:24.520" style="s2">Now, why is that relevant to this?</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.440" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">We were prey upon for a very long period of time and we developed</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:32.520" style="s2">A neural circuit to deal with predators</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.520" end="00:57:36.500" style="s2">And that&#39;s the neural circuit that is activated in children ... when they are terrified</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.500" end="00:57:38.080" style="s2">About monsters at night</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.980" end="00:57:39.480" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.740" end="00:57:42.080" style="s2">The predator entity</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.080" end="00:57:43.400" style="s2">Which is this dragon</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.500" end="00:57:46.840" style="s2">It&#39;s like a ...like amalgam of the predatory forces</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.280" end="00:57:52.220" style="s2">Is one of the manifestations of the things that exist outside of the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.220" end="00:57:54.860" style="s2">So, it&#39;s a ...it&#39;s a form of primodial reality</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.860" end="00:57:57.820" style="s2">It&#39;s not abstract any more, like the matter and spirit container</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.820" end="00:58:02.620" style="s2">It&#39;s like the first practical manifestation of what&#39;s terrifying and treatning</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.620" end="00:58:04.200" style="s2">Concretly  outside that</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.440" end="00:58:05.000" style="s2">And so..</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.120" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">Remember ...</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:08.820" style="s2">Animals can respond to treat</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.820" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">But they can&#39;t conceptualise treat as a category</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:15.400" style="s2">That&#39;s the conceptualsation of treat as a category</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:17.360" style="s2">It emerges absolute unknown</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.360" end="00:58:19.120" style="s2">It manifest itself as treat</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.160" end="00:58:20.440" style="s2">So, for example ...</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.600" end="00:58:24.600" style="s2">If you hear a loud noise behind you or a growl when you&#39;re in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.600" end="00:58:27.580" style="s2">The first thing that happends is you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.580" end="00:58:30.680" style="s2">And that&#39;s initial states of contact with potential</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.680" end="00:58:32.360" style="s2">And then when you turn around</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.360" end="00:58:36.380" style="s2">And you look that potential manifest itself in to something that predatory</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.380" end="00:58:37.880" style="s2">And you have a circuit for that!</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.880" end="00:58:43.240" style="s2">And that&#39;s the same circuit that we now use to assess anything unexpected that occurs to us</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.240" end="00:58:45.740" style="s2">And like that circuit have to come from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.740" end="00:58:49.120" style="s2">And so, our capacity to respond to surprising entities</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.160" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">Is elaboration and elaboration up into abstraction of our capacity to identify predators</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.140" end="00:58:58.460" style="s2">So that&#39;s the next level of reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.560" end="00:59:00.080" style="s2">And out of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:04.800" style="s2">Chaotic circumstance, comes something that&#39;s more human, and...</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.380" end="00:59:07.940" style="s2">...That is the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.940" end="00:59:12.040" style="s2">Masculinity and femininity, and out of that, more primodial element</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.600" end="00:59:29.780" style="s2">Let me show you</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.360" end="00:59:31.180" style="s2">Two things</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.680" end="00:59:36.140" style="s2">This is a map of ...</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.620" end="00:59:39.220" style="s2">...pragmatic teritory</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.420" end="00:59:40.620" style="s2">As far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.620" end="00:59:43.180" style="s2">Is the teritory that people actually inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.960" end="00:59:48.460" style="s2">At the first level , thats the square, I call that The Dragon of Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.260" end="00:59:51.160" style="s2">That&#39;s the unknown as such</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.220" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">And it&#39;s the thing that you fall in to when your conseptual schemes fall epart</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">What manifest itself out of that is...</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.760" end="01:00:02.560" style="s2">Femininity</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.680" end="01:00:04.520" style="s2">And femininity comes in two forms</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.580" end="01:00:06.580" style="s2">One is benevolent femininity</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.300" end="01:00:08.760" style="s2">Example would be</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.460" end="01:00:10.120" style="s2">This</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:14.300" style="s2">You see Mary on the left there</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.300" end="01:00:16.300" style="s2">She is in the structure called a Meandorla</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.300" end="01:00:19.220" style="s2">Which is from a freudian perspective</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.380" end="01:00:20.340" style="s2">Has obvious</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:22.320" style="s2">Sexual conotations</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.380" end="01:00:26.140" style="s2">You see, if you look carefuly, that she&#39;s standing on the reptile</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.280" end="01:00:28.520" style="s2">and holding her child away from it</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.080" end="01:00:31.640" style="s2">It&#39;s a comon midieval christian image</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.640" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">And you can think of it as divine because woman spent an awful lot of time doing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.120" style="s2">with their children over the course of our milions of years of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.120" end="01:00:41.900" style="s2">And it&#39;s something that&#39;s sacred because our species depended on that</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.520" end="01:00:44.440" style="s2">For its...for its survival!</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.680" end="01:00:45.960" style="s2">This is even better</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.960" end="01:00:48.140" style="s2">This is the medieval image, I love this image</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.140" end="01:00:52.780" style="s2">So there is Mary with the Christ child and she is standing again on a reptile</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.780" end="01:00:54.140" style="s2">A predatory reptile</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.140" end="01:00:56.380" style="s2">But in the background you see all those weird little shapes?</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:00:59.360" style="s2">Those are musical instruments</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.360" end="01:01:01.240" style="s2">And there they fill the space</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.240" end="01:01:04.200" style="s2">And the medivialartist who drew this picture</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.220" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">Had this intimation</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.980" end="01:01:06.540" style="s2">That...</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.320" end="01:01:11.360" style="s2">Behind the manifestation of something as primary as...</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.860" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">The protective maternality of Mary was...</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:20.340" style="s2">Something like the music of the spheres or a colection of harmonious patterns</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.340" end="01:01:26.260" style="s2">And at this figure was constantly emerging out of that background of harmonious patterns</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:29.740" style="s2">Across the infinite stretches of time itself!</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.180" end="01:01:30.900" style="s2">That&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.900" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">It&#39;s a sacred image because it represent something that human society can not live without!</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">It&#39;s like...Any society that doesn&#39;t regard the Virgin and the Child</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:43.360" style="s2">Who protects the child from the predatory serpent</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.360" end="01:01:46.300" style="s2">Has prime element of sacred reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.320" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">Is going to make itself extinct!</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:50.620" style="s2">You know ...I could say for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.680" end="01:01:54.580" style="s2">That that&#39;s what happening to the endogenous population of Eastern Europe at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.340" style="s2">where the birth rate is far below replacement</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.680" end="01:02:02.840" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna show you another image</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.580" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">This is called the (................) or &quot;open Virgin &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">And this was a common representation in...</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:12.300" style="s2">Midieval Europe , and it&#39;s weird representation</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.300" end="01:02:13.820" style="s2">From a christian perspective</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.820" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">Because its , kind of, reverses that normal hierarchy of power</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.500" end="01:02:18.860" style="s2">What you have here is</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.080" end="01:02:19.860" style="s2">Mary</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.860" end="01:02:22.360" style="s2">She&#39;s holding the Christ child when the statue is closed</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.360" end="01:02:23.800" style="s2">And then you open her up</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.520" end="01:02:27.240" style="s2">What you see inside Mary is God the Father</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.460" end="01:02:29.380" style="s2">And God the Father is holding</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.560" end="01:02:30.260" style="s2">Christ</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.400" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">In his hands</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:32.260" style="s2">Now....</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.460" end="01:02:38.540" style="s2">Mary constitutes the super ordinate benevolence permanent</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">Inside her is the structure of culture</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.380" end="01:02:45.060" style="s2">So you can think: inside nature is the structure of culture</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.060" end="01:02:47.180" style="s2">And that&#39;s represented in this image by God</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.180" end="01:02:49.800" style="s2">Because he is the ultimate Father, obviously</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.800" end="01:02:50.900" style="s2">In christian thinking, and than</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">The God figure is holding what?</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:55.280" style="s2">Crusified individual</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.900" end="01:02:57.100" style="s2">What is that mean?</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:02:57.940" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.940" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">All the people around there: kings, queens, commoners</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:02.860" style="s2">Are all gazing at that central figure</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.860" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">Which of course is fundamentally what</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:08.780" style="s2">Everyone in western civilisations has been doing for two thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.980" end="01:03:10.440" style="s2">Not knowing why!</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.700" end="01:03:14.860" style="s2">Nature gives rise to the culture</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.920" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">Culture gives rise</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:18.780" style="s2">to the suffering individual</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.240" end="01:03:20.680" style="s2">O! That&#39;s true enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">It&#39;s true for every one</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">It&#39;s true for life every point in time</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.680" end="01:03:28.460" style="s2">But there is more to the image of the crucifiction</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.460" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">Because the crucifiction also represents</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.740" end="01:03:34.280" style="s2">Voluntarily acceptance of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">And volutarily acceptance of death</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:41.480" style="s2">And it also points to something else that&#39;s a paramount importance which is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.340" end="01:03:45.360" style="s2">There is an element of the human psyche that can die</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.380" end="01:03:46.300" style="s2">And Come back!</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.300" end="01:03:49.300" style="s2">And die and come back and that&#39;s what happends to you</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.560" end="01:03:51.940" style="s2">When you encounter a catastrophy</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.940" end="01:03:56.020" style="s2">And you make horror of it, and you climb back out of the underworld</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.020" end="01:03:59.940" style="s2">And you...your vojage through life is punctuated by trips to the underworld</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.940" end="01:04:04.060" style="s2">And so, you are somwhere and then you go outside of that and then you go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.060" end="01:04:05.220" style="s2">and you go outside that</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.220" end="01:04:10.120" style="s2">And so what happends to people is they generaly identify with where they are</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.580" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">Order</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.900" end="01:04:14.380" style="s2">But Order just dissolve and colapses</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.380" end="01:04:15.800" style="s2">and then reconstitutes itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.800" end="01:04:16.740" style="s2">so then you might say</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.740" end="01:04:20.380" style="s2">&quot;If you are trying to adapt to the structure of reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.580" end="01:04:23.100" style="s2">instead of identifying with Order</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.240" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">You would identify with the process that allowed you to transform yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:30.900" style="s2">Across repeated bouts or Order and Chaos</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.180" end="01:04:35.020" style="s2">And thats what this sort of images are trying to represent</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:39.200" style="s2">Let me show you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.500" end="01:04:43.040" style="s2">One final idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.940" end="01:04:52.580" style="s2">There is the Dao&#39;s idea that is like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.580" end="01:04:55.600" style="s2">So the Dao&#39;s symbol, you know the Dao&#39;s symbol?</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.600" end="01:04:57.540" style="s2">I already talked to you about it, you,ve all seen it</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.720" end="01:04:58.760" style="s2">Chaos and Order</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.180" end="01:05:00.780" style="s2">Masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.380" end="01:05:02.680" style="s2">Constantly</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.180" end="01:05:04.340" style="s2">In inter play</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.420" end="01:05:04.920" style="s2">That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.580" end="01:05:06.080" style="s2">Dao!</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.080" end="01:05:07.700" style="s2">From the daoist perpective</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.800" end="01:05:09.640" style="s2">and Dao is the source of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.640" end="01:05:14.140" style="s2">So the idea that there is the constant interplay between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.140" end="01:05:16.860" style="s2">that produces the sense of meaning in human beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.920" end="01:05:17.900" style="s2">And that&#39;s true!</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.980" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">That is what produces the sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:25.460" style="s2">You know that because when you engage in a compeling operation</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.460" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">you&#39;re partly ordered than secured and you have one foot out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:31.180" style="s2">And the balance is proper</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.180" end="01:05:33.740" style="s2">And as a consequence you&#39;re engaged in what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.740" end="01:05:36.820" style="s2">And as  consequence of that you loose yourself consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.940" end="01:05:40.140" style="s2">And if you stay engaged in that sort of situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.140" end="01:05:44.180" style="s2">On a continual basis then you find that your life is meaningfuland rich</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.180" end="01:05:48.820" style="s2">And that is the best antidote to the fact that life is bounded and full of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.040" end="01:05:49.540" style="s2">Now...</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.080" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">Dao means meaning and also means jurney</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.060" end="01:05:57.020" style="s2">And the center of the Dao is the place  you&#39;re suppose to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.240" end="01:05:59.720" style="s2">One foot in chaos and one foot in order</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">And thats the best place to be in the actual enviroment itself</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:08.440" style="s2">because the actual enviroment is better construde than the constant danger play</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.440" end="01:06:12.780" style="s2">between chaos and order than it is construde as a colection of the material objects</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.100" end="01:06:15.420" style="s2">And if you adopt the pragmatic view</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.600" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">that points out that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.140" end="01:06:21.580" style="s2">There are metarealities above the miere objects that we percieve</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.580" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2">You can also apprehend that our brains are actualy adapted</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:26.880" style="s2">To the metarealities and not the realities</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.920" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">Because our brains are like</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.540" end="01:06:30.660" style="s2">3 hundred million years old</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.800" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">And what we&#39;ve done is abstracted out those things that are constant across</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.060" end="01:06:36.100" style="s2">strands of times</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.100" end="01:06:39.880" style="s2">Strand of times that are hundred millions years in lenght</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.200" end="01:06:43.160" style="s2">and those are&#39;nt chairs and tables or automobiles</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.160" end="01:06:47.320" style="s2">They are metastructures that are much more sophisticated than that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.320" end="01:06:51.820" style="s2">and we ignore that at our perilbecause modern people don&#39;t believe  that meaning exist</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.820" end="01:06:53.120" style="s2">They think it&#39;s myth</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.120" end="01:06:53.820" style="s2">Epiphenomal</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.820" end="01:06:56.680" style="s2">There is nothing subjective about our world view</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.700" end="01:06:59.460" style="s2">where in fact our nervous systems are tuned</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.800" end="01:07:04.200" style="s2">so that life is manifesting itself in the most meaningful possible way</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.200" end="01:07:08.520" style="s2">when you happend to be occuping the precise position between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.680" end="01:07:11.260" style="s2">that maximases your  security</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.260" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">and the developement of that security across time</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.920" end="01:07:15.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.640" end="01:07:23.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the most realthing there  is and to stay in that positionis also to accept voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.800" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">the necessity for a certain degree of suffering</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.540" end="01:07:29.020" style="s2">because as you extend your capacitys</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.100" end="01:07:32.860" style="s2">by exposing yourself to the optimal level of the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.860" end="01:07:37.020" style="s2">You&#39;re constantly taking yourself apart and rebuilding yourself</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.100" end="01:07:41.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s what allows you to trive not only in the present self stability</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.500" end="01:07:43.660" style="s2">But also in a state that consists</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.660" end="01:07:45.800" style="s2">of the transformation of that stability</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.820" end="01:07:59.940" style="s2">Here is the representation from ancient Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.560" end="01:08:03.860" style="s2">Thise are the representations of Horus</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.860" end="01:08:10.080" style="s2">There is a lot of evidence that many of the ideas we have about Christ are derivative of Egyptian ideas</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.660" end="01:08:12.560" style="s2">Most people who point that out</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.060" end="01:08:18.460" style="s2">point it out in the manner that, saying that&#39;s devaluing the ideas that we&#39;re derive from Egipt</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.840" end="01:08:21.240" style="s2">Because they have a priority motive</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.240" end="01:08:22.860" style="s2">Which is the distractive motive</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.540" end="01:08:28.620" style="s2">As mitology progreses across the centuries its transforms itself</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.620" end="01:08:32.380" style="s2">And it tends to continually encapsulate, re-encapsulate</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.380" end="01:08:38.440" style="s2">The primary ideas that the human race is managed to produce  both the structure and reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.440" end="01:08:40.940" style="s2">There are constantcies across this cultural</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.460" end="01:08:46.580" style="s2">manifestations because the reality to which they referes actually reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.620" end="01:08:48.280" style="s2">Horus</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.720" end="01:08:52.000" style="s2">This is the good lesson and I leave you with this</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.180" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">Horus is the eye</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.180" end="01:08:57.380" style="s2">The eye is not the intelect!</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.680" end="01:09:03.200" style="s2">The intelect is the thing that forces everything into the pre-existing structure</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.680" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">And it crunches reality to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">It works it and twists it</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:10.100" style="s2">And it makes people ideological and rigid</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.100" end="01:09:12.580" style="s2">The eye is something comletely different</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.220" end="01:09:15.860" style="s2">The eye is the thing that pays attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.860" end="01:09:18.260" style="s2">And your attention is automaticaly directed</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.260" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">To those elements of your experiencial field</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:24.220" style="s2">When the most information it&#39;s manifesting itself</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.220" end="01:09:26.520" style="s2">That&#39;s why for example if you&#39;re talking to someone in the bar</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.520" end="01:09:29.960" style="s2">And there&#39;s TV flickering you can&#39;t help butlook at the TV</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.960" end="01:09:34.300" style="s2">The change, the transformation is what your nervous system is atuned to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:37.680" style="s2">And the teory is that if you are a follower of Horus</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.680" end="01:09:42.260" style="s2">Who&#39;s the eye and the falcon, because falcons can see and they fly above everything else</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.260" end="01:09:45.080" style="s2">If you are a follower of Horus you pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.080" end="01:09:47.560" style="s2">When you pay attention you absorbe information</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.660" end="01:09:50.700" style="s2">when you absorb information you continually</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.600" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">Transform yourself</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:56.140" style="s2">And that keeps you on top of that ever shifting reality</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.660" end="01:09:58.120" style="s2">Doing that is meanningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.120" end="01:10:01.180" style="s2">And that&#39;s what stops you from becoming bitter and cruel</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.180" end="01:10:03.760" style="s2">Because, you know, life is suffering</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.760" end="01:10:06.860" style="s2">And if you don&#39;t have an antidote to that suffering that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.860" end="01:10:09.960" style="s2">Then you become resentful about the structure of experience</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.960" end="01:10:12.740" style="s2">And then you do everything you can to take revenge on it</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.400" end="01:10:18.040" style="s2">And we saw what happened when people get that in the  twentieth century</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.040" end="01:10:21.380" style="s2">And it would be a good thing if people won&#39;t happend stop doing it</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.880" end="01:10:25.240" style="s2">And as far as I can tell after trying to figure this out for, like ...</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:26.800" style="s2">thirty years</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.220" end="01:10:28.960" style="s2">The way that you do that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.160" end="01:10:31.300" style="s2">Is by paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.300" end="01:10:34.160" style="s2">And transforming yourself when it&#39;s neccesary</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.620" end="01:10:37.180" style="s2">And stoping the proces of identifying</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.180" end="01:10:39.040" style="s2">With what you already believe</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.040" end="01:10:41.020" style="s2">who the hell cares what you believe ?</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.020" end="01:10:43.860" style="s2">You should be attending to the things you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">Which is a much larger space than the things you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:51.320" style="s2">And then you should be construing yourself not as the inhabitant</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.320" end="01:10:54.440" style="s2">of a sterile and static, and already completed</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.140" end="01:10:55.860" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.860" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">But as the thing that lives on the edge of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:00.600" style="s2">That&#39;s constantly building and re-building it</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.060" end="01:11:04.340" style="s2">and then if something happends to your structure</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.340" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not so relevant because thats not what you are!</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.440" end="01:11:11.220" style="s2">you are the thing that can engage in transformation of structure</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">by paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.880" end="01:11:18.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s what thise representations mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.540" end="01:11:28.060" style="s2">this are Renaissance pictures , you know, they elevated</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.440" end="01:11:32.900" style="s2">the entity that voluntarily accepted the necessity of suffering and  death</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.900" end="01:11:34.680" style="s2">So that&#39;s represented by Christ</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.140" end="01:11:38.500" style="s2">to the highest position in the heavenly hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.900" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">what that idea means is that what should constitute the transcended value</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:51.340" style="s2">that sits above all other values</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.080" end="01:12:02.160" style="s2">is your capacity to voluntarily accept the restricted and painful conditions of your life</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.220" end="01:12:03.680" style="s2">to face them</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.680" end="01:12:07.960" style="s2">And as a consequence of facing them immediately transcend them</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.960" end="01:12:10.860" style="s2">and one of the things we know from clinical psychology</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.860" end="01:12:13.380" style="s2">is that if you have someone who is afraid</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.240" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">they aviod</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.020" end="01:12:17.820" style="s2">so what do you do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.820" end="01:12:20.660" style="s2">you brake down the things they are afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.660" end="01:12:23.360" style="s2">till you find the small unit that they can approach</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.920" end="01:12:27.760" style="s2">When they approach it they learn that they can approach it</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.760" end="01:12:29.680" style="s2">and that they&#39;re more than they thought they were</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.720" end="01:12:32.120" style="s2">and they can approach the next thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.120" end="01:12:37.560" style="s2">and than the next thing so you take a women whos got agarophobia who can&#39;t get into an elevator</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.560" end="01:12:43.720" style="s2">and week later she can and then she goes home and has the fight with her husband that she should had twenty years ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.720" end="01:12:47.760" style="s2">adn the reason for that is that when she is exposed to the things that she&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.760" end="01:12:49.180" style="s2">insted of running from them</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.200" end="01:12:54.160" style="s2">she learns that she is the thing that can be exposed to thing she&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.160" end="01:12:56.580" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t learn that things aren&#39;t frightning</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.580" end="01:13:01.700" style="s2">and learning the  thing  she&#39;s is the thing that can be exposed to things that are frightning</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.700" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">makes her more than the  frightning things</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:09.180" style="s2">and is certenely possible that we &#39;re more than the things that frightened us</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.180" end="01:13:11.420" style="s2">if we weren&#39;t we wouldn&#39;t be here</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.040" end="01:13:29.200" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t throw this things away before we understand them</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.240" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re in danger of doing that now</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.660" end="01:13:37.700" style="s2">so part what I was trying to do with my lecture and my work is to poin out</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.200" end="01:13:39.000" style="s2">what our...</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.320" end="01:13:40.520" style="s2">forefathers knew</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.140" end="01:13:48.300" style="s2">to try to help modern people understand it and to make pace that this things that we think of as</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.360" end="01:14:00.020" style="s2">non-real representations are more real then enything that we currently comprehend as a real</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.080" end="01:14:06.500" style="s2">that consequences of not comprehending them</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.060" end="01:14:10.940" style="s2">And living by them as far as I can tell is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.320" end="01:14:12.680" style="s2">things deteriorate</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.780" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">And they can deteriorate to the point</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2">Where everything is intolerable for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.240" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s seams to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.420" end="01:14:24.680" style="s2">suboptimal destination</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.700" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">thanks for the invitation</p>
