<p begin="00:01:44.930" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">so the thing I&#39;d like to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">today is you&#39;ve been doing this thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">where we you know initially we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">learning the past night and we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">getting I know remember the metaphor the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">pond we&#39;re getting to get the pond to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">still still so the stilling of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">surface and I brought an enquiring</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">lifeless going deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">now we want to take that quite deep this</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.610" style="s2">practice is the deepening of a pasta and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">it has it has a very important function</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.610" end="00:02:24.629" style="s2">now you&#39;ve already like everything else</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve all been training us implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.629" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">especially more recently but now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">going to make it explicit and focal so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">the idea here is we want to take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">kind of insight that the parsnip affords</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:49.859" style="s2">but we want to take it into the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">meta and this is and what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.859" end="00:02:53.400" style="s2">today is actually preparation for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">practice where I&#39;m going to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.400" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">next week which is the progeny practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.319" end="00:03:01.319" style="s2">but we want to take that mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">that the past not very very deep we want</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.319" end="00:03:05.549" style="s2">to like breaking frame in a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">really deep and profound way remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.549" end="00:03:09.510" style="s2">what we want we want eventually to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">able to integrate the past not the level</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.510" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2">of matter we want you know that insight</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">not to just be a cognitive or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">intellectual insight but one going an</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.919" style="s2">accident an existential insight when</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:22.769" style="s2">going into the depths of that process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.919" end="00:03:26.579" style="s2">identification a process by which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">assuming and assigning identities we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.579" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">also want to bring a space into that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:35.579" style="s2">want to open it up so so now we serve</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:38.819" style="s2">getting deeper but we want to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.579" end="00:03:43.139" style="s2">open up a space in which when only three</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.819" end="00:03:45.299" style="s2">from automatic unconscious and reactive</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.139" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">ways in which were framing that process</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.299" end="00:03:51.540" style="s2">of identity formation and operation we</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:57.109" style="s2">also want to be free too we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.540" end="00:04:00.359" style="s2">free to grow develop change transform</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.109" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">freedom from what was just right which</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.359" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve already been really deepening and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">now we&#39;re going to deepen that more but</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">also start to integrate it with freedom</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">- what does that mean well think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.099" style="s2">how I mentioned especially if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:16.410" style="s2">been meditating on your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.099" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">especially the distraction of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.410" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">it could come a moment where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:25.469" style="s2">distraction goes away there is no set</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:29.969" style="s2">there&#39;s no inner speech so inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.469" end="00:04:33.319" style="s2">pictures is just a space and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.969" end="00:04:36.930" style="s2">happening in that space is you are dis</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.319" end="00:04:41.430" style="s2">identifying your dis identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.930" end="00:04:44.999" style="s2">that inner speaking voice and think</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:46.830" style="s2">about how much we identified with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.999" end="00:04:49.259" style="s2">inner voice in our head that inner</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.830" end="00:04:51.029" style="s2">speaking voice and of course that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.259" end="00:04:52.289" style="s2">afforded us lots of things we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.029" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">about how you need to do that with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.289" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">coaching are you directing like</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.229" style="s2">everything else that this has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.360" style="s2">tremendous function but like every</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.229" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">function it can be overused and abused</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.360" end="00:05:06.770" style="s2">and malfunction and what happens is if</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:09.569" style="s2">we are too tightly and automatically and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.770" end="00:05:13.159" style="s2">mindlessly identified with our speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.569" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">voice that puts a lot of constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.159" end="00:05:20.789" style="s2">the process of identity formation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:22.319" style="s2">operation remember we&#39;re talking not</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.789" end="00:05:23.969" style="s2">just about the identities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.319" end="00:05:25.800" style="s2">assuming for yourself because they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.969" end="00:05:27.270" style="s2">correlated and Co determined by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.800" end="00:05:29.250" style="s2">identities you&#39;re assigning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.270" end="00:05:32.310" style="s2">everything else so to the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.250" end="00:05:34.199" style="s2">which you are over identified with your</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.310" end="00:05:36.930" style="s2">speaking mind is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.199" end="00:05:39.089" style="s2">your identity and the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.930" end="00:05:41.699" style="s2">world can disclose a tough self to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.089" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">are locked down and of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.699" end="00:05:45.149" style="s2">trying to open that up and meta now</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.560" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">we&#39;re deepening the past us so we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.149" end="00:05:50.939" style="s2">take it more deeply into a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:53.449" style="s2">integration with meta itself so how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.939" end="00:05:55.500" style="s2">we do this it sounds all very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.449" end="00:05:57.659" style="s2">one thing is you&#39;re already doing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.500" end="00:06:00.899" style="s2">which is whenever you meditating on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.659" end="00:06:07.229" style="s2">distraction and it falls silent there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.899" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">for moment no speech no scenery I try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.229" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">as I said try to create a felt memory</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:14.490" style="s2">for that what does that feel like does</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">that feel like and I know you&#39;ll say but</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.490" end="00:06:19.529" style="s2">I have to talk to myself and try not to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:21.719" style="s2">count the initial self coaching as part</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.529" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">of what you&#39;re paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.719" end="00:06:24.899" style="s2">eventually you&#39;ll just be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.310" style="s2">directly note oh you wanted to save</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.899" end="00:06:28.710" style="s2">yourself just like you don&#39;t have to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.310" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">to yourself you know I need to turn on</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.710" end="00:06:31.740" style="s2">the tap when you&#39;re washing your hands</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:33.240" style="s2">you just notice that you need to turn on</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.740" end="00:06:35.339" style="s2">the top you&#39;ll get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.240" end="00:06:37.080" style="s2">you&#39;ll just notice without having to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.339" end="00:06:40.470" style="s2">speak yourself oh this is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.080" end="00:06:44.250" style="s2">when my mind is empty inner speech and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.470" end="00:06:45.750" style="s2">inner scenery so that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.250" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">already mentioned this to you and now</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.750" end="00:06:51.300" style="s2">you want to make that you know something</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:52.919" style="s2">that you really try to remember to do on</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.300" end="00:06:56.460" style="s2">a regular basis with dealing with your</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.919" end="00:07:01.259" style="s2">destructions but now we&#39;re also going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.460" end="00:07:04.620" style="s2">learn a new focus for of a pasta that is</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">metaphor that we already use think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.550" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">train of thought the idea is a train of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:55.620" style="s2">thought right</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.690" style="s2">one thing is pulling on the other and</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.690" end="00:09:02.550" style="s2">because they&#39;re linked like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.250" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">causal effect to train all right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.550" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">imagine now a literal train and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:08.940" style="s2">you&#39;re standing very close to it its it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">fills up your vision and it seems solid</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.940" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">to you but if you could step back and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:22.019" style="s2">look at deeper version of this all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.779" style="s2">you can actually notice the space</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.019" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">between the cars and then you can do</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.779" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">that thing with your attention where</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:31.140" style="s2">instead of for grounding the cars you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:34.230" style="s2">forth around the space between the cars</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.140" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">and you start to see beyond the empty</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.230" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">space you see beyond the train to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:42.660" style="s2">empty space that&#39;s on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:45.329" style="s2">it so what we do is we&#39;re sitting we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.660" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">the basics of pasta for a while and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.329" end="00:09:51.810" style="s2">we just let write the distractions the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">thoughts come up but here&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.810" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">gonna do we&#39;re gonna count our thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.860" end="00:10:07.410" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna count your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.850" end="00:10:10.260" style="s2">1 2 3 4 5 the number the number is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.410" end="00:10:12.120" style="s2">meaningless the point about counting</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:15.240" style="s2">your thoughts is it does that thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.120" end="00:10:17.490" style="s2">where you step back and by counting you</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.240" end="00:10:19.860" style="s2">step back and you start to look for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.490" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">spaces between your thoughts and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.860" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">be small but you&#39;ve had some familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">of that already from working with your</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">structure than in crime rifles you look</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:32.520" style="s2">at the spaces and then try more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">to notice the spaces typically what</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.520" end="00:10:37.260" style="s2">happens is they start to get bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:39.660" style="s2">the the train of thought starts to slow</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.260" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">down and then see if you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.660" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">see if you then do for pasta where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">focus isn&#39;t on your breath the focus is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:53.459" style="s2">on that empty space between your</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:55.620" style="s2">thoughts and then the distractions are</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.459" end="00:10:57.300" style="s2">out here again that&#39;s the empty space</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.620" end="00:10:59.399" style="s2">between your thoughts and then what do</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.300" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">you do you apply the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.399" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">inquiring mindfulness to that empty</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:04.209" style="s2">space you meditate into it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:06.639" style="s2">meditatively quest</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.209" end="00:11:08.220" style="s2">into it in the tradition this is it this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.639" end="00:11:11.050" style="s2">is described as you&#39;re like a cat</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.220" end="00:11:12.939" style="s2">sitting outside of a mousehole waiting</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.050" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">for a mouse what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.939" end="00:11:18.100" style="s2">so I meditate into that space and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.220" end="00:11:19.660" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to see when I&#39;m in that space</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.100" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">is I&#39;m trying to get an inkling I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.660" end="00:11:25.629" style="s2">trying to get a sense of sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:27.790" style="s2">movement of bubbling and energy that</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.629" end="00:11:30.459" style="s2">right as if a thought is going to form</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.790" end="00:11:32.499" style="s2">and see if you can pull back this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.459" end="00:11:35.309" style="s2">identify with that bubbling it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.499" end="00:11:38.319" style="s2">there so that it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.309" end="00:11:40.679" style="s2">germinate into a thought bubbles here</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.319" end="00:11:44.230" style="s2">that&#39;s probably and so you&#39;re meditating</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.679" end="00:11:48.209" style="s2">into that space and you&#39;re always sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.230" end="00:11:50.949" style="s2">of sensing these proto thoughts these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.209" end="00:11:54.490" style="s2">first first seeds there&#39;s no so many</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.949" end="00:11:56.559" style="s2">metaphors for thinking and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.490" end="00:11:59.619" style="s2">stay dis identified from them and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.559" end="00:12:01.569" style="s2">try to look at them just as shifting</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.619" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">patterns if you&#39;ll allow me this</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.569" end="00:12:07.059" style="s2">metaphor of energy and then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:09.579" style="s2">you&#39;re meditating on and what tends to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.059" end="00:12:12.369" style="s2">happen is you get the empty space</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.579" end="00:12:14.679" style="s2">between your thoughts opens up very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.369" end="00:12:17.999" style="s2">profit and you keep meditating into it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.679" end="00:12:22.209" style="s2">the five factors of inquiry mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.999" end="00:12:23.799" style="s2">now you say to me but how do it like if</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.209" end="00:12:25.329" style="s2">I was counting my thoughts what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.799" end="00:12:27.189" style="s2">with their distractions it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.329" end="00:12:30.309" style="s2">rule if you can get to the place with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.189" end="00:12:32.290" style="s2">space between your thoughts is now you</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.309" end="00:12:35.610" style="s2">know center stage and holding the mic</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.290" end="00:12:38.019" style="s2">then that becomes your passing the focus</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.610" end="00:12:40.209" style="s2">you stop counting your thoughts and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.019" end="00:12:41.439" style="s2">focus on the space you now you say well</p>

<p begin="00:12:44.889" end="00:12:48.699" style="s2">following your breath you zero in on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.019" end="00:12:51.339" style="s2">space and you say but what if I get</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.699" end="00:12:53.499" style="s2">fully distracted correct if you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.339" end="00:12:57.160" style="s2">fully distracted from the space if you</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.320" end="00:37:30.170" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.930" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.170" end="00:37:40.099" style="s2">so there&#39;s I&#39;m trying to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.260" style="s2">careful representative I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.099" end="00:37:46.430" style="s2">give people sort of too much expectation</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.260" end="00:37:48.890" style="s2">because then that&#39;ll play into it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.430" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">try and hold on to that emptiness I know</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.890" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">that sounds strange if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:56.450" style="s2">keep it in existence that&#39;s the language</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.000" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to keep it into existence</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.450" end="00:38:00.680" style="s2">that will actually mean you&#39;ll go back</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.000" end="00:38:02.690" style="s2">off and just thought and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.680" end="00:38:04.099" style="s2">because you&#39;ll get that hard you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.690" end="00:38:05.780" style="s2">actually doing the opposite of what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.099" end="00:38:07.640" style="s2">want is that hard focusing trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.780" end="00:38:10.670" style="s2">keep it into into existence is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.640" end="00:38:12.920" style="s2">opposite of that I of the soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:16.220" style="s2">that we want at the core of acquiring</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.920" end="00:38:17.690" style="s2">mindfulness so instead of trying to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.220" end="00:38:19.099" style="s2">know keep it into existence try and look</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.690" end="00:38:21.140" style="s2">and then it might be oh then it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.099" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">goes away right and I&#39;m going back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.140" end="00:38:25.130" style="s2">the basics in that that&#39;s like I said</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">that that will take quite a bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.130" end="00:38:28.609" style="s2">quite a bit of time before that starts</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:31.609" style="s2">to stabilize you have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.609" end="00:38:32.869" style="s2">practice quite a bit so I your question</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.609" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">was a little ambiguous I hope I answered</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.869" end="00:38:39.619" style="s2">both sides of it or both interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:41.300" style="s2">ah sure Brioni what&#39;s the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.619" end="00:38:42.710" style="s2">meditating on distractions as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.300" end="00:38:44.359" style="s2">understand either the distraction goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.710" end="00:38:46.609" style="s2">away in which case you should try not to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.359" end="00:38:48.680" style="s2">be happy about it you go away in which</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.609" end="00:38:49.970" style="s2">case you start again or you&#39;re enduring</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.680" end="00:38:52.460" style="s2">and have to start again none of which</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.970" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">sounds particularly beneficial um it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.460" end="00:38:58.970" style="s2">very beneficial if the distraction goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:39:00.770" style="s2">away then you get that moment of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.970" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">dissident vacation that I rectified was</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.770" end="00:39:05.540" style="s2">talking about today which is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:08.630" style="s2">important if you go away you can realize</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.540" end="00:39:10.790" style="s2">how powerful these distractions are and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.630" end="00:39:14.150" style="s2">you&#39;ll start to give you get ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.790" end="00:39:16.670" style="s2">meditate into them to quite as that as a</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.829" end="00:39:26.329" style="s2">from your distractions reveal some very</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:28.280" style="s2">deep habitual patterns of mind this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.329" end="00:39:30.710" style="s2">how you can become aware of them and how</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.280" end="00:39:32.089" style="s2">you can learn them and so that you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.710" end="00:39:34.670" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer operating</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.089" end="00:39:37.640" style="s2">unconsciously and reactively in you if</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.670" end="00:39:40.130" style="s2">you&#39;re merely enduring yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.640" end="00:39:42.380" style="s2">then that is something that should just</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.130" end="00:39:45.109" style="s2">be that is I agree with you that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.380" end="00:39:46.849" style="s2">uh if it comes to just endurance that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.109" end="00:39:48.470" style="s2">fruitless and you should let it go</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.849" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what the practice says and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.470" end="00:39:54.890" style="s2">return back to following you brother</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:56.569" style="s2">these are Carlucci sometimes if I hold</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.890" end="00:39:59.150" style="s2">my breath my thoughts also pause and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.569" end="00:40:01.339" style="s2">then and there&#39;s that space was that why</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.150" end="00:40:04.059" style="s2">does that happen and should I not do</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.339" end="00:40:07.730" style="s2">that um you shouldn&#39;t hold your breath</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.059" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">so holding your breath is an alerting</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.730" end="00:40:13.970" style="s2">response okay and so alerting response</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.700" end="00:40:17.059" style="s2">will often make your mind go empty so</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.970" end="00:40:19.250" style="s2">that you can give those resources to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.059" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">whatever threat or you know really</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.250" end="00:40:22.220" style="s2">important opportunity is suddenly in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.309" style="s2">front of you that&#39;s why you can even</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.220" end="00:40:27.230" style="s2">freeze in fear because what it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.309" end="00:40:29.299" style="s2">to do is clear everything away so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.230" end="00:40:29.690" style="s2">everything can be given to you what&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.299" end="00:40:31.819" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.690" end="00:40:34.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s why it does that I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.819" end="00:40:38.210" style="s2">recommend not holding your breath if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.039" end="00:40:39.859" style="s2">can because your sir I understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.210" end="00:40:43.819" style="s2">kind of nice because you get that to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.859" end="00:40:46.009" style="s2">that pause holding your breath may be</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.819" end="00:40:47.390" style="s2">very very slightly to get that is okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.009" end="00:40:49.190" style="s2">but trying to you know making an</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.390" end="00:40:52.789" style="s2">extensive and repeated practice then</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.190" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">you&#39;re going to limit the space to only</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.789" end="00:40:56.569" style="s2">when you&#39;re holding your breath and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.710" end="00:40:59.000" style="s2">while it initially gives you a gift</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.569" end="00:41:01.430" style="s2">it&#39;s got a hook in it then keeps you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.000" end="00:41:03.619" style="s2">sort of attached to that state of empty</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.430" end="00:41:05.480" style="s2">breath which is not good for trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.619" end="00:41:07.130" style="s2">bring this kind of depth of awareness in</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.480" end="00:41:08.630" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing Praja because in Praja</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.130" end="00:41:10.819" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be trying to get this</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.630" end="00:41:12.170" style="s2">depth while following the flow of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.819" end="00:41:14.329" style="s2">breath that doesn&#39;t make much sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.170" end="00:41:15.799" style="s2">right now but I&#39;m just mentioning that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.329" end="00:41:22.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s relevant to answering the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.799" end="00:41:24.470" style="s2">question was asked Mycah Schreck back</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.970" end="00:41:25.700" style="s2">pain during the practice despite trying</p>

<p begin="00:41:27.259" end="00:41:31.309" style="s2">because the pain is really distracting</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.490" end="00:41:34.730" style="s2">me from bullying present yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.309" end="00:41:35.809" style="s2">yeah so I hope that you&#39;re trying not</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.730" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">only different positions but also</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.809" end="00:41:39.380" style="s2">meditating against the wall perhaps or</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:41.990" style="s2">in a chair to take some of the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.380" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">off if you&#39;re still getting pain then</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">and then some people it becomes part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:50.730" style="s2">their practice because they experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:53.930" style="s2">chronic pain chronic pain and so</p>
