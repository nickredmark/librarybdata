<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:07.530" style="s2">looking back I didn&#39;t know I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">intelligent when I was a child I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.530" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">just because children are as curious as</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">they are and as intelligent as they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">and so things stuck or they didn&#39;t stick</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:19.470" style="s2">I was very interested in our religion as</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">a child I read through the Bible when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.470" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">was in grade 4</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:26.050" style="s2">I am which i think is fairly unique I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:27.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think votes for grade fours or</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.050" end="00:04:29.830" style="s2">read the Bible I don&#39;t know how much I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">understood but I did read it from cover</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.830" end="00:04:36.640" style="s2">to cover and we it&#39;s weird is looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">back like I have three things that make</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.640" end="00:04:40.690" style="s2">my brain medically unique to than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:45.610" style="s2">rest of the world I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.690" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">everybody is it is neurodiverse I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.610" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">really believe in neurotypicals mainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.380" end="00:04:49.720" style="s2">because my brain so isn&#39;t her own</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:52.360" style="s2">typical I don&#39;t even know what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.720" end="00:04:54.760" style="s2">would be like I&#39;m sure they do exist but</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.360" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">at the same time how do you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.760" end="00:04:57.820" style="s2">you know what anyone else&#39;s brain is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:00.970" style="s2">like unless you&#39;ve been in it and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.820" end="00:05:02.830" style="s2">haven&#39;t you&#39;ve only been in one I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.970" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">been in multiple in my brain because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.830" end="00:05:06.820" style="s2">it&#39;s continually changing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.900" end="00:05:08.530" style="s2">what makes it unique so I had a TD my</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.820" end="00:05:11.080" style="s2">whole life and I knew that I had a TD</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:13.390" style="s2">but my brother had it worse than I did</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.080" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t feel as a TD as him but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.390" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">knew I was definitely fair to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">else I think if I hadn&#39;t had a TD maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.980" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">I would have been seen as intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:23.560" style="s2">and junior in like elementary school</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">because I wouldn&#39;t have associated might</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.560" end="00:05:27.850" style="s2">me with like Jubilee cats it still it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.500" end="00:05:29.860" style="s2">needs to get up and talk to her friends</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.850" end="00:05:34.750" style="s2">all that talk to everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.860" end="00:05:36.460" style="s2">classroom and those kind of things where</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.750" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">I don&#39;t know there were things that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.460" end="00:05:39.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t there were things that stuck</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:41.950" style="s2">automatically in things that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.220" end="00:05:45.340" style="s2">stick and looking back I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.950" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">fairly good at retaining information</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.340" end="00:05:51.040" style="s2">especially if I was curious about it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:56.070" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know I&#39;m sorry master Merritt</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.040" end="00:05:57.550" style="s2">is exactly I created great but again</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.070" end="00:06:01.990" style="s2">they exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:04.810" style="s2">neurotypicals again I don&#39;t know and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.990" end="00:06:06.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve known I was a TD my almost my whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.810" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">life once my brother was diagnosed and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.610" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">it became apparent that most people my</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:14.470" style="s2">family are my my uncles and me and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:15.850" style="s2">brother my sister are way less so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.470" end="00:06:18.340" style="s2">don&#39;t actually think she&#39;s a to date at</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.850" end="00:06:20.970" style="s2">all this she just likes saying she was</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.340" end="00:06:26.950" style="s2">things she could have overcome them um</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.970" end="00:06:29.260" style="s2">but having what a lot of what like life</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.950" end="00:06:31.780" style="s2">circumstances masked a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.260" end="00:06:34.439" style="s2">neurodiversity I didn&#39;t know I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.780" end="00:06:36.569" style="s2">autistic till last year partly because</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.439" end="00:06:39.599" style="s2">we moved around so much in my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.569" end="00:06:41.249" style="s2">that I associated not having friends and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.599" end="00:06:43.860" style="s2">having trouble fitting into groups from</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.249" end="00:06:45.869" style="s2">that and that could vary like we I went</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.860" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">to I counted them up before this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.869" end="00:06:49.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t count them up on camera I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:50.759" style="s2">just seven different elementary schools</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.050" end="00:06:53.580" style="s2">which is kindergarten to grade six I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.759" end="00:06:54.959" style="s2">repeated grade three so in eight years I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:58.139" style="s2">went to seven different elementary</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.959" end="00:07:01.619" style="s2">schools and I lived in eight different</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.139" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">houses and on top of that even though I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.619" end="00:07:05.969" style="s2">went to eight different sorry seven</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:07.489" style="s2">different schools I did not count up the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.969" end="00:07:11.129" style="s2">teachers that I know in grade 3</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.489" end="00:07:12.509" style="s2">specifically I had a teacher I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.129" end="00:07:14.849" style="s2">given and then I was given a new teacher</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.509" end="00:07:16.649" style="s2">and we had to go to these little cubicle</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.849" end="00:07:17.969" style="s2">or do they called I don&#39;t even know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.649" end="00:07:18.899" style="s2">aren&#39;t like in the main school and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.969" end="00:07:20.129" style="s2">the secondary school which was cool</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.899" end="00:07:22.229" style="s2">because I was in grade 3 and it made me</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.129" end="00:07:26.519" style="s2">feel grown up and then we moved from</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.229" end="00:07:27.929" style="s2">Edmonton Raymond and I had a teacher two</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.519" end="00:07:29.789" style="s2">teachers that taught that grade and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.929" end="00:07:31.139" style="s2">they decided four teachers my first year</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.789" end="00:07:32.489" style="s2">of grade three and how they decided I</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.139" end="00:07:34.110" style="s2">should repeat grade three yes I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.489" end="00:07:35.639" style="s2">know it wasn&#39;t fitting in I was having</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.110" end="00:07:37.529" style="s2">trouble struggling after having four</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.639" end="00:07:39.779" style="s2">teachers and then the second year I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.529" end="00:07:42.059" style="s2">two new teachers so I mean they taught</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.779" end="00:07:44.550" style="s2">together so it&#39;s but seven teachers for</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.059" end="00:07:47.669" style="s2">two years of grade three which is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.550" end="00:07:49.649" style="s2">I think even more than that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.669" end="00:07:53.179" style="s2">moved yes we moved halfway through my</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.649" end="00:07:55.079" style="s2">grade three-year tip for the Edmonton to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.179" end="00:07:57.089" style="s2">Raymond and then we moved halfway</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.079" end="00:08:01.559" style="s2">through my second grade three year to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.089" end="00:08:06.329" style="s2">left bridge moving ahead for for schools</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.559" end="00:08:08.189" style="s2">for grade three that is a lot well I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.329" end="00:08:09.569" style="s2">having social trouble like I always felt</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.189" end="00:08:11.729" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t quite belong and it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.569" end="00:08:16.559" style="s2">hard to make friends granted Raymond was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.729" end="00:08:19.529" style="s2">an entire what if I called town full of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.559" end="00:08:21.689" style="s2">Mormons and we were Christian so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.529" end="00:08:23.249" style="s2">really didn&#39;t fit in even nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.689" end="00:08:26.279" style="s2">wanted to play but that was beyond like</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.249" end="00:08:29.399" style="s2">even there was just Sir circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.279" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">beyond like Anne in Edmonton we had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.399" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">very I don&#39;t know like there was like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:36.149" style="s2">gang of children and so everyone fit it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:37.469" style="s2">and even if you didn&#39;t fit in you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.149" end="00:08:38.879" style="s2">necessarily have a friend but like there</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.469" end="00:08:39.959" style="s2">was enough kids outside playing in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.879" end="00:08:43.469" style="s2">common area you&#39;d always have something</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.959" end="00:08:44.910" style="s2">to play with and then so there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.469" end="00:08:47.009" style="s2">people to play with but I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.910" end="00:08:48.060" style="s2">have a friend and then we moved to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.009" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">Raymond and it was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.060" end="00:08:52.380" style="s2">all my only friends really my siblings</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">was the only ones who gets us and like</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.380" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">our okay with our family and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:59.190" style="s2">left brain should I had more because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:09:02.660" style="s2">my imagination I had friend like when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.190" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">was younger younger imagination was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.660" end="00:09:08.040" style="s2">bonus a bonus for four other kids and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:10.050" style="s2">had a hyper imagination</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.040" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">I still haven&#39;t shown as I was they</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.050" end="00:09:11.690" style="s2">believe in bad the world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.690" end="00:09:16.440" style="s2">only I could has concentrated on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">writing I wanted to do since I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.440" end="00:09:21.029" style="s2">then maybe I could communicate it but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:22.620" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m sticking up a childhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.029" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">for way too long because there isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">like the two-minute introductory part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:28.770" style="s2">the portion but I didn&#39;t know I knew I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">had a TV I didn&#39;t know anything else at</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.770" end="00:09:31.020" style="s2">the time and I didn&#39;t know it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:33.540" style="s2">intelligent until I got to high school</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.020" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">because in junior high in Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.540" end="00:09:36.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still the case but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:37.589" style="s2">there&#39;s elementary to grade six so they</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.420" end="00:09:39.029" style="s2">can go to junior high for seven eight</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.589" end="00:09:42.779" style="s2">nine and then you have high school for</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.029" end="00:09:44.190" style="s2">11 for 10 11 12 and junior High&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.779" end="00:09:46.110" style="s2">the throwaway years it&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.190" end="00:09:47.790" style="s2">hormones kick in don&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.110" end="00:09:51.300" style="s2">you&#39;re going through more peer stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.790" end="00:09:54.260" style="s2">that you are intellectual and so I had</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">this alcoholic teacher that was a I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.260" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t know he&#39;s an alcoholic but I met</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:10:00.540" style="s2">his son later who also didn&#39;t like him</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">but he thinking back he&#39;s smelling</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.540" end="00:10:04.620" style="s2">alcohol all the time but it didn&#39;t click</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.990" style="s2">that that was his reason and why he had</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.620" end="00:10:10.339" style="s2">issues he had issues me probably cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.990" end="00:10:13.589" style="s2">mean vessel I pay attention in class and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.339" end="00:10:15.060" style="s2">my I was not on medication at basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.589" end="00:10:17.270" style="s2">any point for a because my brother was</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.060" end="00:10:20.339" style="s2">fond of medication he got Tourette&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.270" end="00:10:21.980" style="s2">and so it was like and he even went off</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.339" end="00:10:24.570" style="s2">medication at one point in time even</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:26.460" style="s2">after trying all of them and so I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.570" end="00:10:27.900" style="s2">and because we were I was less than and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.460" end="00:10:31.290" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want side effects I did not go</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.900" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">on ATT buds uh-huh he anyway so high</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.290" end="00:10:34.830" style="s2">school this teacher that was both my</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:36.930" style="s2">math and science teacher told me I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.830" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">an idiot literally he was like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.930" end="00:10:41.310" style="s2">not smart enough to do mainstream math</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">and like there&#39;s a nicer way to say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.310" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">he&#39;s like so you need to do money do</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">math there&#39;s no way you can handle it</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:48.500" style="s2">you should also probably do a remedial</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:50.850" style="s2">science but we&#39;ll leave that up to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.500" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">there was like the sciences were split</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.850" end="00:10:54.810" style="s2">up into chemistry physics and biology or</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">you could take remedial science and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.810" end="00:11:01.570" style="s2">wanted didn&#39;t understand anyway so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:05.589" style="s2">went into remedial math</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.570" end="00:11:08.680" style="s2">and started off reading your thing don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.589" end="00:11:10.449" style="s2">you see good c180 oh yeah I know he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.680" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">the worst teacher definitely the worst</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.449" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">teacher again I bet his son won at one</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:18.430" style="s2">point when I was in high school and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:20.649" style="s2">were at a party but horrible but if he</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.430" end="00:11:21.910" style="s2">would hadn&#39;t been in my path I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.649" end="00:11:23.380" style="s2">have went into remedial math and if I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.910" end="00:11:24.459" style="s2">hadn&#39;t went into media laughs I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.380" end="00:11:28.509" style="s2">think I ever would have known how</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.459" end="00:11:30.069" style="s2">intelligent I was because the first exam</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.509" end="00:11:31.240" style="s2">that I did I never quite got a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.069" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">percent because I always made one or two</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.240" end="00:11:38.860" style="s2">errors that were kind of like stupid but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">I got 99% on almost every math test that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.860" end="00:11:45.130" style="s2">I did in math 13 some like 10 20 30 and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:46.569" style="s2">then 13 23 33 so I ended up going I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.130" end="00:11:49.300" style="s2">for math classes in the three years</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.569" end="00:11:51.220" style="s2">because I did I switched in the I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.300" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">switched I did thirteen twenty three</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.220" end="00:11:57.459" style="s2">twenty thirty and I got nearly 99% in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:58.839" style="s2">all of them and if I hadn&#39;t if I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.459" end="00:11:59.980" style="s2">written or maybe go math I wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.839" end="00:12:01.089" style="s2">gotten nearly a hundred percent I</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.980" end="00:12:02.380" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have known I was smart and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.089" end="00:12:05.829" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have gotten straight A&#39;s in all</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.380" end="00:12:09.250" style="s2">of my classes I got eighty was an A and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.829" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">I think I got 277 in German 20 and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.250" end="00:12:13.959" style="s2">everything else I got I got an A in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:16.690" style="s2">which is how I got into University four</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.959" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">years later after going to volunteer in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.690" end="00:12:21.310" style="s2">Costa Rica and going to Australia and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:23.199" style="s2">once I get high school I know I was in</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.310" end="00:12:24.940" style="s2">television because I&#39;ve got grades and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.199" end="00:12:27.310" style="s2">that is how you know you&#39;re intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.940" end="00:12:31.990" style="s2">it&#39;s about getting good grades and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.310" end="00:12:33.940" style="s2">I went to university I took 4 years off</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.990" end="00:12:38.680" style="s2">from between High School University</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.940" end="00:12:40.420" style="s2">which is its own story and then god I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.680" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">knew I wanted to take I wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.420" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">marine biologist so I wanted to got into</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:47.260" style="s2">UBC while I was in Australia I applied</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">to this program called science 1 which</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.260" end="00:12:52.120" style="s2">is at UBC and it&#39;s an integrated science</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:54.310" style="s2">program with like the top science</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.120" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">students people who end up going in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:56.319" style="s2">there so they&#39;re all the people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:59.439" style="s2">didn&#39;t even just get a tease they got</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.319" end="00:13:02.709" style="s2">like 99% in school got the scholarships</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.439" end="00:13:03.250" style="s2">and it was like 50 of us in class five</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.709" end="00:13:05.380" style="s2">days a week</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.250" end="00:13:07.269" style="s2">besides our clubs that we did with other</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.380" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">science students and so our physics</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.269" end="00:13:11.139" style="s2">professor or math professor chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:13.089" style="s2">professor my professor were all in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.139" end="00:13:14.870" style="s2">same room and although we had individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.089" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">classes it was more about</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.870" end="00:13:18.870" style="s2">how do we integrate them how to science</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.280" end="00:13:21.510" style="s2">apply to chemistry apply to biology you</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.870" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">play math the one downfall that was that</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.510" end="00:13:26.340" style="s2">they taught calculus in this weird way</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:28.650" style="s2">where like some of us didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.340" end="00:13:29.700" style="s2">calculus in high school or mine offered</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.650" end="00:13:31.890" style="s2">it but I didn&#39;t know what it was so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.700" end="00:13:33.150" style="s2">didn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:34.740" style="s2">and so they taught it in this weird way</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.150" end="00:13:36.930" style="s2">where it was like above the heads of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.740" end="00:13:39.690" style="s2">people like me that hadn&#39;t taken it</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.930" end="00:13:41.280" style="s2">before and way below there&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.690" end="00:13:43.470" style="s2">who was a repetition for it was like</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.280" end="00:13:45.990" style="s2">this in-between it was just bad so</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.470" end="00:13:47.790" style="s2">calculus isn&#39;t my strong point and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.990" end="00:13:49.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t do great on it and I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.790" end="00:13:51.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t do great in science one I got</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.410" end="00:13:52.710" style="s2">like 60% because I failed physics</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.060" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">because physics wasn&#39;t high school</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.710" end="00:13:57.630" style="s2">physics where I basically got to go in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:14:00.270" style="s2">the night before the test cram and asic</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.630" end="00:14:01.890" style="s2">because it was just following the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.270" end="00:14:04.350" style="s2">equations and putting in the numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.890" end="00:14:06.510" style="s2">doing math it was how do you derive the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.350" end="00:14:09.570" style="s2">equations how does this actually make</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.510" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">sense in science and I thought was not I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.570" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">was not this physicist and then the math</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:16.140" style="s2">was difficult between those two but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:18.900" style="s2">did a lot of open book tests a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.140" end="00:14:20.550" style="s2">group tests a lot of so and I was really</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.900" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">good at the biology portion I was okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.550" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">at the chemistry portion and I had a 40</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">other like 49 other peer support people</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">to help because it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:31.530" style="s2">competitive system even though these</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.970" style="s2">people who went through the like science</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.530" end="00:14:34.980" style="s2">is fairly competitive it was like who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.970" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">smarter but not if you get an A I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.980" end="00:14:39.810" style="s2">gonna get an A and so universe was</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:41.370" style="s2">really interesting because I had the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.810" end="00:14:44.730" style="s2">science one experiment and then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.370" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">else you go to year one and tarde but</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.730" end="00:14:50.550" style="s2">then you go to gear 2 and it&#39;s a step up</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:52.290" style="s2">and for us it was like science one was</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.550" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">everyone was in kindergarten but we I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.290" end="00:14:56.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know like we did more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:59.580" style="s2">stuff so we then when we went into grade</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.370" end="00:15:01.350" style="s2">grade 2 we wanted to get her to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.580" end="00:15:03.900" style="s2">else it was a step up and for us it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.350" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">honestly a step down and so I took one</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.900" end="00:15:09.090" style="s2">grade three three three your three class</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:09.960" style="s2">that I really loved it won&#39;t be route</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.090" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">memorization</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.960" end="00:15:14.340" style="s2">when Chavez never really great at I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.260" style="s2">would cuz this is part of like a TD from</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.340" end="00:15:17.520" style="s2">what I understand now is you can cram</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.260" end="00:15:19.290" style="s2">information in your brain with</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.520" end="00:15:20.820" style="s2">adrenaline and it doesn&#39;t stay around</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.290" end="00:15:22.920" style="s2">long but that&#39;s kind of how you can pass</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.820" end="00:15:25.200" style="s2">tests and I it&#39;s been really little on</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.920" end="00:15:27.180" style="s2">tests with the adrenaline sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:27.960" style="s2">ready to test and cramming it in with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.180" end="00:15:29.399" style="s2">with adreno</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.960" end="00:15:31.320" style="s2">and there was something about that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.399" end="00:15:33.630" style="s2">I was like I can pretty much do any test</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.320" end="00:15:37.550" style="s2">write an essay over a two-week period no</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.630" end="00:15:39.870" style="s2">write an essay in two hours yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.550" end="00:15:42.990" style="s2">University was just weird because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.870" end="00:15:44.730" style="s2">also like all of the bell curve all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">like the 80 plus students who get in and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.730" end="00:15:48.690" style="s2">then they redistribute themselves so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:50.580" style="s2">knew and I was a mature student was four</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.690" end="00:15:53.160" style="s2">years older than everybody else so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.580" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">kind of knew that one put a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.160" end="00:15:55.500" style="s2">kids who go to school it&#39;s their first</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:15:57.380" style="s2">time away from their parents ain&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.500" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">partying and I&#39;m sliding down the scale</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.380" end="00:16:01.800" style="s2">but I had this hypothesis that I bet you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">there were a ton of C and D students</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.800" end="00:16:06.089" style="s2">from high school who didn&#39;t apply</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:07.709" style="s2">themselves and were bored and probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.089" end="00:16:09.600" style="s2">would have thrived in a university and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.709" end="00:16:13.170" style="s2">so it was weird that you needed this</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.600" end="00:16:14.970" style="s2">higher grades to get in and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.170" end="00:16:16.709" style="s2">extracurricular but then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.970" end="00:16:18.149" style="s2">redistributed yourselves anyway it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.709" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">like this seems arbitrary than like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.149" end="00:16:22.589" style="s2">medical school UBC&#39;s science day one</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:24.600" style="s2">they asked everyone who plans to go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.589" end="00:16:26.610" style="s2">medical school and 99% of people put up</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.600" end="00:16:28.350" style="s2">their hands because it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.610" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">engineering students so engineers the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.350" end="00:16:32.580" style="s2">other thing that scientists go into to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.680" style="s2">go but they go into university to do for</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.580" end="00:16:35.880" style="s2">science and at the end of course not</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.680" end="00:16:37.589" style="s2">everyone gets into Medical School not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.880" end="00:16:38.700" style="s2">everyone even follows that path it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.589" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">just the thing you do if you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.700" end="00:16:43.470" style="s2">science enough comin up der and I never</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:44.940" style="s2">wanted to be a doctor one to a marine</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.470" end="00:16:47.339" style="s2">biologist and I wanted to did you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.940" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">all of elephants and anyway this about</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.339" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">my brain so in year three that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:56.250" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:17:00.270" style="s2">I would&#39;ve been in your floor no I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.250" end="00:17:01.860" style="s2">in year three and I was doing integrated</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.270" end="00:17:03.690" style="s2">science degree so I was taking a college</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.860" end="00:17:05.040" style="s2">in genetics and with a minor in</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.690" end="00:17:06.390" style="s2">economics but you can&#39;t do a minor in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.040" end="00:17:08.730" style="s2">economics with an integrated science</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.390" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">degree so I just took the courses in any</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.730" end="00:17:12.660" style="s2">way at a lot of genetics a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.040" style="s2">ecology a lot of biology I threw out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.660" end="00:17:15.270" style="s2">biology courses I didn&#39;t want to take I</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.040" end="00:17:16.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to take Anatomy I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.270" end="00:17:18.870" style="s2">want to take I wanted to take more</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.380" end="00:17:22.290" style="s2">economic students learned that I spent</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.870" end="00:17:23.790" style="s2">this entire semester it&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.290" end="00:17:25.559" style="s2">second the FIR the last part of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.790" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">first semester and into the second</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.559" end="00:17:30.780" style="s2">semester with double vision and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:32.490" style="s2">finally cuz I was also working in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.780" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">laboratory at the time which I got</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.490" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">through science one and I had a couple</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:36.900" style="s2">other people from science one in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">laboratory we were undergrads we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.900" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">paid to be a which was our own record</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:46.290" style="s2">remember you&#39;re paid to do like an</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:48.450" style="s2">internship a paid during University and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.290" end="00:17:50.520" style="s2">it was an amazing experience because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.450" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">were treated like peers in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.520" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">laboratory as we were able to like</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.220" end="00:19:51.540" style="s2">neuroma in my brain my hearing on one</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.470" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">side was 30% compared to hearing no</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.540" end="00:19:55.870" style="s2">other side which again I should have</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:57.309" style="s2">known because I would talk to someone on</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.870" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">the phone and be like yeah and then be</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.309" end="00:20:00.669" style="s2">like why don&#39;t you get quiet I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:03.780" style="s2">understand and I didn&#39;t know that it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.669" end="00:20:05.860" style="s2">one year they got in to get surgery</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.780" end="00:20:07.059" style="s2">fairly fast they had to mount my brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.860" end="00:20:08.770" style="s2">they had to get that stuff down and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.059" end="00:20:12.820" style="s2">not a deadly tumor it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.770" end="00:20:16.860" style="s2">generally cancerous it was a really hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.820" end="00:20:16.860" style="s2">time for my family it was a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.070" end="00:20:21.669" style="s2">but it was also a really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.900" end="00:20:23.559" style="s2">rewarding time I was saying yes to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.669" end="00:20:25.210" style="s2">things like going to parties and going</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.559" end="00:20:27.370" style="s2">to events with friends like I never</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.210" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">really did before I was like alright who</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.370" end="00:20:31.570" style="s2">knows I&#39;m gonna die during this I need</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:34.809" style="s2">to have as much as possible and my whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.570" end="00:20:38.070" style="s2">family came down for the surgery and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.809" end="00:20:40.780" style="s2">had the surgery which resulted in me</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.070" end="00:20:42.700" style="s2">because my brain corrected for vision as</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.780" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">long as it could and then it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.700" end="00:20:45.669" style="s2">eat anymore and it went into double</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:46.900" style="s2">vision when I got it my tumor taken out</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.669" end="00:20:48.820" style="s2">and we crossed the other way and I had</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.900" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">extreme double vision that my brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.820" end="00:20:53.169" style="s2">would eventually coordinate I had I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:54.100" style="s2">deaf in one ear and they severed the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.169" end="00:20:56.020" style="s2">year because they couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.100" end="00:20:57.400" style="s2">save the hearing and if I had three</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.020" end="00:21:01.390" style="s2">tumors not just one all wrapped around</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.400" end="00:21:04.330" style="s2">in in one and but the main thing was</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.390" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">after I mean getting acclimatized to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.330" end="00:21:07.480" style="s2">single-sided deafness is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.549" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know direction of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.480" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">sounds and you don&#39;t know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.549" end="00:21:13.000" style="s2">of information you can no longer process</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:17.890" style="s2">remember walking down the street and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.000" end="00:21:19.929" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of humor like I&#39;m over</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.419" end="00:21:36.280" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it&#39;s like everything came from</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.400" end="00:21:38.740" style="s2">from my left side because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.280" end="00:21:41.620" style="s2">only sign I hear on but right after my</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.740" end="00:21:43.720" style="s2">surgery I was living with my roommate</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">know if it being back in hospital for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.340" end="00:23:45.010" style="s2">for a few about another week and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:46.750" style="s2">first time after brain surgery I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.010" end="00:23:48.310" style="s2">only in for a couple days so as much and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.750" end="00:23:50.440" style="s2">then I ended up going to stay with one</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.310" end="00:23:52.090" style="s2">of mine with my boss from the lab and my</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.440" end="00:23:54.730" style="s2">dad would come and watch me and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:57.340" style="s2">not like learn how to ReWalk it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.730" end="00:24:00.120" style="s2">quite that dramatic but Laurie learned</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.340" end="00:24:02.650" style="s2">balance and it was harder and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.120" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">just allow my brain to have this resting</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.650" end="00:24:11.310" style="s2">time and what&#39;s the point of that okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.510" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">besides just bring tubers and fun um</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.310" end="00:24:15.670" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:16.690" style="s2">I yeah oh the reason that my brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.670" end="00:24:18.820" style="s2">swelled was because they took me out</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.690" end="00:24:20.620" style="s2">steroids that was that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.820" end="00:24:22.750" style="s2">their policy that&#39;s best steroids are</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.620" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">considered a more dangerous drug they</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.750" end="00:24:25.870" style="s2">want to watch you while you&#39;re on them</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:27.160" style="s2">and so they took me off of them for my</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.870" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">surgery and might have brain swelled</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.160" end="00:24:32.650" style="s2">because it couldn&#39;t handle it it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:33.730" style="s2">taper it off and so then which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.650" end="00:24:37.330" style="s2">know that&#39;ll be important or in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.730" end="00:24:39.940" style="s2">story because depends on whether taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.330" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">gray trade right now I love it to murder</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.940" end="00:24:44.350" style="s2">once it&#39;s daata eak let&#39;s do double</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:46.630" style="s2">vision which now like it&#39;s funny my</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.350" end="00:24:48.340" style="s2">doctor I&#39;ve had so many doctors like</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.630" end="00:24:49.330" style="s2">does this and that&#39;s something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.340" end="00:24:51.310" style="s2">supposed to get in your annual exam</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.330" end="00:24:53.620" style="s2">basically every year because if your</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.310" end="00:24:55.150" style="s2">sound isn&#39;t the same on both sides then</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.620" end="00:24:57.010" style="s2">it can be a symptom of an acoustic</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.150" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">neuroma which are quite common well the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.010" end="00:25:00.100" style="s2">brain tumors they&#39;re not common but out</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">of brain tumors they&#39;re fairly common</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.100" end="00:25:08.470" style="s2">and so I went back did my last year of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">university but I really wasn&#39;t quite the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.470" end="00:25:12.430" style="s2">same it wasn&#39;t as easy if I hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.680" style="s2">in fourth year and they kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.430" end="00:25:15.880" style="s2">accommodations like well I was going</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.680" end="00:25:17.410" style="s2">through my brain store they definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.880" end="00:25:19.090" style="s2">made accommodations I was allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.410" end="00:25:20.260" style="s2">basically do the work I wanted to do and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.090" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">not do any of the other work but then I</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.260" end="00:25:25.270" style="s2">had a whole year to do I had another</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:27.610" style="s2">year to do so I did that year and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.270" end="00:25:30.370" style="s2">passed it and I got my university degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.610" end="00:25:31.900" style="s2">and I went on to you finance a finance</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.370" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">degree as well so I could still use my</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.900" end="00:25:36.700" style="s2">brain it was still alright but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:39.070" style="s2">quite the same and I was always I ended</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.700" end="00:25:41.410" style="s2">up calling in sick a lot to every job I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.070" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">had after that because I was exhausted a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.410" end="00:25:44.020" style="s2">lot of the time from from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">single-sided deafness without really</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.020" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">quite realizing that until my new I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.930" style="s2">single-sided deaf I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:52.540" style="s2">realize that the amount of processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.930" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">that like the only other time I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.540" end="00:25:55.750" style="s2">experience not much fatigue in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.580" end="00:25:57.760" style="s2">matter it was when I was in Germany</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.750" end="00:25:59.080" style="s2">trying to learn another language or</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.760" end="00:26:00.160" style="s2">you&#39;re just so exhausted by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.080" end="00:26:01.180" style="s2">the day sir paintings like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.160" end="00:26:02.830" style="s2">pick up something that I can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.180" end="00:26:07.300" style="s2">pick up and that&#39;s what I felt after</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.830" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">becoming definite one year so then five</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.300" end="00:26:12.280" style="s2">years later because that was in 2005</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:14.440" style="s2">that I had my brain surgery in 2010 what</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.280" end="00:26:16.420" style="s2">happened why would they Oh cuz I got</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.440" end="00:26:18.910" style="s2">nearly MRI scans I got here the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.420" end="00:26:20.710" style="s2">eye scans and it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.910" end="00:26:21.880" style="s2">tumor that oh this is why by the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.710" end="00:26:23.050" style="s2">telling my story today because I have</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.880" end="00:26:25.180" style="s2">the fresh haircut you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.050" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">when I first get my back of my head</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.180" end="00:26:31.460" style="s2">shape actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.710" end="00:26:32.840" style="s2">my original scar from that one which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.460" end="00:26:34.369" style="s2">a little proud of this has been when</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.840" end="00:26:36.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve been through I have another one</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.369" end="00:26:37.820" style="s2">which I&#39;ve never seen because I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.440" end="00:26:43.099" style="s2">had my hair cut short but it&#39;s closed</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.820" end="00:26:45.019" style="s2">across here um that I got they said it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.099" end="00:26:46.669" style="s2">had grown back and so I either had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.019" end="00:26:47.749" style="s2">choice I could get surgery again it</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.669" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">would mean I basically have to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.749" end="00:26:53.720" style="s2">surgery every five to ten years or I</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:55.159" style="s2">could get radiation on it and so I opted</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.720" end="00:26:56.479" style="s2">for radiation even though I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.159" end="00:26:58.669" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to have radiation on my</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.479" end="00:27:01.340" style="s2">brain I didn&#39;t have radiation anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.669" end="00:27:06.649" style="s2">especially on my brain but it was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.340" end="00:27:08.149" style="s2">only option so basically so I went in</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.649" end="00:27:11.179" style="s2">and got that done for the month at like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.149" end="00:27:12.830" style="s2">December 2010 and my brain has never</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.179" end="00:27:14.210" style="s2">been the same since between the swelling</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.830" end="00:27:16.580" style="s2">after the first surgery and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.210" end="00:27:18.139" style="s2">radiation I will I was undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.580" end="00:27:20.599" style="s2">radiation I started becoming really</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.139" end="00:27:22.099" style="s2">sensitive to smells I had to take the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.599" end="00:27:25.159" style="s2">public transit even though I lived</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.099" end="00:27:27.019" style="s2">fairly close to the hospital it was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.159" end="00:27:30.440" style="s2">maybe a five minute bus ride and only</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.019" end="00:27:32.869" style="s2">one bus bus I like the smells of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.440" end="00:27:34.820" style="s2">would I was radiation makes you nauseous</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.869" end="00:27:36.259" style="s2">and I was I although I didn&#39;t puke very</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.820" end="00:27:38.450" style="s2">much because I have a suppression of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.259" end="00:27:39.619" style="s2">like a pregnancy and radiation I did and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.450" end="00:27:42.619" style="s2">I went off of pot in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.619" end="00:27:44.779" style="s2">radiation but hurt my koala gist was</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.619" end="00:27:46.700" style="s2">like so you show people start smoking</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.779" end="00:27:48.379" style="s2">pot not going off of it just you know I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.700" end="00:27:50.210" style="s2">wasn&#39;t allowed to take any antioxidants</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.379" end="00:27:51.710" style="s2">a guy wasn&#39;t always been able to eat</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.210" end="00:27:53.359" style="s2">pomegranates and stuff because that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.710" end="00:27:56.899" style="s2">defeats the purpose of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.359" end="00:27:58.489" style="s2">and I thought I could work while I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.899" end="00:27:59.539" style="s2">doing it but no you cannot work what</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.489" end="00:28:00.859" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s just you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.539" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">go in every day to get this radiation</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.859" end="00:28:05.869" style="s2">and it makes you tired and it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:07.099" style="s2">to whatever you experienced your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.869" end="00:28:09.019" style="s2">radiation it&#39;s supposed to kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.099" end="00:28:11.869" style="s2">away within a few months and my never</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.019" end="00:28:15.109" style="s2">did my not radiate my sensitivity to</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:18.200" style="s2">because they they would make</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.970" end="00:29:21.529" style="s2">accommodation so I never get a</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.200" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">provincial disability and while they did</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.529" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">the preliminary work for the radiation</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:27.320" style="s2">of my brain sorry well they did the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:29.510" style="s2">preliminary work and did scans they</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.320" end="00:29:32.690" style="s2">found a fourth tumor at the top of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.510" end="00:29:34.909" style="s2">head and I like to think of it as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.690" end="00:29:35.960" style="s2">universe telling me for years at the one</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.909" end="00:29:37.370" style="s2">they&#39;re like you&#39;re not listening you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.960" end="00:29:38.570" style="s2">not listening some acoustic room is all</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.370" end="00:29:40.549" style="s2">about your hearing it&#39;s on your hearing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.570" end="00:29:44.210" style="s2">nerve and then I went deaf in one ear</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.549" end="00:29:46.130" style="s2">and then my life improved a bit because</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.210" end="00:29:47.720" style="s2">of the brain tumors and connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.130" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">people and it was a wake-up call in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.720" end="00:29:54.919" style="s2">lot of other ways and then I realized</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:56.149" style="s2">that this is like if you know chakra is</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.919" end="00:29:57.529" style="s2">it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t your connection to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.149" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">your higher power and it&#39;s like right at</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.529" end="00:30:00.710" style="s2">my crown chakra it&#39;s like right where</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.090" end="00:30:02.299" style="s2">the two brain hemispheres meet and right</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.710" end="00:30:04.429" style="s2">at the top I was like oh I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.299" end="00:30:06.590" style="s2">listening to a higher power God whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.429" end="00:30:07.909" style="s2">that views not listening to my colleague</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.590" end="00:30:09.260" style="s2">about less seems like this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.909" end="00:30:11.419" style="s2">keep happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.260" end="00:30:13.549" style="s2">I finally had that brain surgery to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.419" end="00:30:15.380" style="s2">that tumor out when my daughter was 2 so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.549" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">about five years ago so it was 2005</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.380" end="00:30:20.750" style="s2">brain surgery for 2010 radiation 2015</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:24.049" style="s2">brain surgery again and after that brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.750" end="00:30:26.090" style="s2">surgery I insisted on them giving me</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.049" end="00:30:28.850" style="s2">steroids and they were like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.090" end="00:30:31.940" style="s2">know where the doctors it was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.850" end="00:30:33.260" style="s2">cool but this happened last time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.940" end="00:30:34.880" style="s2">like well we&#39;ll just you don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.260" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">people steroids to take home with them</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.880" end="00:30:38.059" style="s2">you have to have it in the hospital and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:39.679" style="s2">so the day I was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.059" end="00:30:42.139" style="s2">discharged they took me off the steroids</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.679" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t taper them like I took like like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.139" end="00:30:48.019" style="s2">alright and by that day that day at noon</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">I was nonverbal</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.019" end="00:30:51.649" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t communicate I was not like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">couldn&#39;t move from the bed and they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.649" end="00:30:55.970" style="s2">like oh turns out maybe you can do</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">steroids for a while so I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.970" end="00:31:00.350" style="s2">taking steroids taking them home and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:02.120" style="s2">got tapered off over two weeks and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.350" end="00:31:03.590" style="s2">like I&#39;m not seeking steroids here this</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.120" end="00:31:07.640" style="s2">is know what&#39;s going on I don&#39;t want my</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.590" end="00:31:09.549" style="s2">brain to swell and anyway so turns out I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.640" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">know more than they do about my body and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.549" end="00:31:14.270" style="s2">it worked out fine my brain didn&#39;t smell</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:15.650" style="s2">that time but your brain just being cut</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.270" end="00:31:19.460" style="s2">open and you&#39;re you having to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.650" end="00:31:21.650" style="s2">those things is different why so I knew</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.460" end="00:31:23.059" style="s2">I had EDD muffled life my brain changed</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.650" end="00:31:26.029" style="s2">from radiation and two brain surgeries</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.059" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">that is honestly very minor brain damage</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.029" end="00:31:30.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not a car accident it&#39;s not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:32.870" style="s2">even have headaches I had headaches all</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.679" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">the time as a young kid and then brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.870" end="00:31:36.409" style="s2">tumors didn&#39;t I have these really</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:38.659" style="s2">intense sharp headaches before when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.409" end="00:31:40.549" style="s2">was first diagnosed and I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.659" end="00:31:41.659" style="s2">headaches less undergoing radiation but</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.549" end="00:31:43.610" style="s2">other than that I don&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.659" end="00:31:46.309" style="s2">headaches so every time I get one I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.610" end="00:31:47.539" style="s2">little concerned and you&#39;re as well is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.309" end="00:31:49.130" style="s2">this a stroke that&#39;s after you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.539" end="00:31:56.450" style="s2">radiation it can make those things more</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.130" end="00:31:59.059" style="s2">prominent but I know but a radiation -</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.450" end="00:32:01.190" style="s2">surgery&#39;s minor brain damage and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.059" end="00:32:03.890" style="s2">amount of impact that has had on my life</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.190" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">has been huge I can&#39;t remember I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.890" end="00:32:06.500" style="s2">executive function like I used to I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:08.600" style="s2">can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.500" end="00:32:11.029" style="s2">input information like I used to with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.600" end="00:32:15.409" style="s2">DV where I would cram it in with dren</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.029" end="00:32:17.270" style="s2">illan I cuz it all just shuts down I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.409" end="00:32:19.159" style="s2">used to read two or three books a week I</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.270" end="00:32:20.809" style="s2">now can read if I really want to read a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.159" end="00:32:23.720" style="s2">book I can read like one a month because</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.809" end="00:32:27.110" style="s2">I need a lot of nap time during it and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.720" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">can only imagine what it costs to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.110" end="00:32:32.049" style="s2">more brain damage to have something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.330" end="00:32:35.419" style="s2">is more traumatic for your brain like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.049" end="00:32:36.200" style="s2">hit to the head or a something going</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.419" end="00:32:38.659" style="s2">into your brain</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.200" end="00:32:41.419" style="s2">these were medically induced - like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.659" end="00:32:43.640" style="s2">said two surgeries by absolute experts</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.419" end="00:32:45.380" style="s2">who did an amazing job and a course of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.640" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">radiation again done by experts you did</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.380" end="00:32:49.309" style="s2">an amazing job but my body side effects</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:50.870" style="s2">from that or like brain swelling after</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.309" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">the first one almost brain swelling up</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.870" end="00:32:54.470" style="s2">for the second one and definitely some</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">brain changes during the radiation which</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.470" end="00:32:58.970" style="s2">supposedly doesn&#39;t happen it supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:00.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t stick around but I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.970" end="00:33:04.940" style="s2">my brain hasn&#39;t been the same since then</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.260" end="00:33:06.740" style="s2">and then last year so because I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.940" end="00:33:07.720" style="s2">a DD and I have brain damage I went to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.740" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">my doctor</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.720" end="00:33:13.990" style="s2">two or three years ago to get a TD meds</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:16.750" style="s2">so that I could write the book on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.990" end="00:33:18.460" style="s2">world saving idea that I had let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.750" end="00:33:21.280" style="s2">if I can make my brain concentrate for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.460" end="00:33:23.620" style="s2">day but I know from experience that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.280" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">having the ATD meds I can&#39;t take them</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.620" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">constantly because they I&#39;ve chronic</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">fatigue and you can do whatever all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">the interconnection of all of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:32.620" style="s2">disabilities means that I can&#39;t take a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:33.940" style="s2">TD meds all today every day and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.620" end="00:33:36.040" style="s2">want to whose of my relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.940" end="00:33:37.870" style="s2">pharmaceuticals and so I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.040" end="00:33:39.430" style="s2">doctor to basically say can I get a TD</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.870" end="00:33:40.870" style="s2">meds to take when I need them when I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.430" end="00:33:43.690" style="s2">really need to be article for the day</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.870" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">and she understandably it was like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.690" end="00:33:47.890" style="s2">no that&#39;s from seeking that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">we do anyone would be able to knock off</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.890" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">their to-do list if they if they got to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:55.300" style="s2">matter all like yes but they&#39;re not easy</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:58.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s not the same I can tell you my</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.300" end="00:33:59.560" style="s2">brain is slightly more neurotypical when</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.120" end="00:34:01.690" style="s2">I take this drug but I can&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.560" end="00:34:04.090" style="s2">daily anyway so she ended up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.690" end="00:34:05.680" style="s2">diagnosing me with a DD because I had it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.090" end="00:34:07.240" style="s2">as a child not as an adult I had to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.680" end="00:34:08.140" style="s2">rediagnosis a DS she put me with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.240" end="00:34:09.730" style="s2">psychiatrist</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.140" end="00:34:12.220" style="s2">well we were waiting for that process</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.730" end="00:34:15.100" style="s2">she gave me a quiz to see if I&#39;d a DD</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.220" end="00:34:17.290" style="s2">and they weren&#39;t the normal questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.100" end="00:34:19.330" style="s2">they were like similar but not quite the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.290" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">ones that I&#39;m used to with a DD and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.330" end="00:34:23.530" style="s2">turns out she&#39;d given me the autism</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:26.610" style="s2">questionnaire by mistake I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.530" end="00:34:29.800" style="s2">and I was like oh that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.610" end="00:34:32.169" style="s2">turns out I might have autism and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.800" end="00:34:33.550" style="s2">but but she no way she didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.169" end="00:34:35.350" style="s2">acknowledge idatv she doesn&#39;t was a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.550" end="00:34:36.970" style="s2">acknowledged autism I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.350" end="00:34:39.130" style="s2">psychiatrist it&#39;s like I just like yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.970" end="00:34:41.080" style="s2">we can&#39;t give you a one-off drug but</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.130" end="00:34:42.280" style="s2">after trying them for I was like I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.080" end="00:34:43.810" style="s2">try it for two weeks and I was so</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.280" end="00:34:45.610" style="s2">exhausted by the end but it worked while</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.810" end="00:34:47.050" style="s2">I was on it so he basically gave me what</p>

<p begin="00:37:01.390" end="00:37:06.580" style="s2">life but I didn&#39;t know until I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.950" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">almost 40 and then my actual brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.580" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">changes that worked night and day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:12.820" style="s2">not like one day I was this and one day</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:15.400" style="s2">I was that my brain still constantly</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.820" end="00:37:20.220" style="s2">changing from I think again the swelling</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.400" end="00:37:23.070" style="s2">and the radiation and the just aging</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.220" end="00:37:25.720" style="s2">minimum all of these things getting a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.070" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">rather large effect on your brain and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.720" end="00:37:29.740" style="s2">then all of the things I have chronic</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:31.050" style="s2">fatigue fibromyalgia human digestive</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.740" end="00:37:33.609" style="s2">orders are all thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.050" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">neurological and or autoimmune and or</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.609" end="00:37:35.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t figure this out because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.950" end="00:37:39.190" style="s2">strange they don&#39;t have the brainpower</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:40.630" style="s2">and you can&#39;t figure out your own stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.190" end="00:37:45.220" style="s2">because a placebo effect and all of us</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.630" end="00:37:48.730" style="s2">anyway so through this I ended up on</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.220" end="00:37:49.740" style="s2">disability at home depressed really for</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.730" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.740" end="00:37:54.790" style="s2">chilling with my anxiety dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">what does my life look like now I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.790" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">gonna be the Jane Goodall of elephants I</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:00.010" style="s2">was gonna say world I was gonna do that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:03.640" style="s2">by learning everything I could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.010" end="00:38:06.190" style="s2">learn and so I learned genetics and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.640" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">ecology and I learned economics and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.190" end="00:38:12.700" style="s2">learned finance and a lot of self-help</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.869" style="s2">stuff in psychology and history and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.700" end="00:38:16.630" style="s2">things that I thought I should know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.869" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">because people should know them some of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.630" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">those which I was interested in science</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:21.910" style="s2">and some math and then some of which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:24.180" style="s2">wasn&#39;t quite interesting but thought I</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.910" end="00:38:26.230" style="s2">should learn geography in history and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.180" end="00:38:30.010" style="s2">when it came to the point where I</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.230" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">couldn&#39;t read anymore I couldn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.010" end="00:38:33.220" style="s2">put in new information I knew that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:34.990" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna become the person who is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.220" end="00:38:36.430" style="s2">who is intellectually a genius oh I</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.990" end="00:38:37.859" style="s2">could save the world in whatever weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.430" end="00:38:41.590" style="s2">abstract way that that was gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.859" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">but in sitting in my room in depression</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.590" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">in basically enforced meditation because</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:50.920" style="s2">like sit your butt down stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:52.119" style="s2">anything and just be and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.920" end="00:38:54.010" style="s2">world is going through this right now</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.410" end="00:39:01.750" style="s2">you&#39;re now in your emotion in your space</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.330" end="00:39:03.190" style="s2">in your story and from that space it</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.750" end="00:39:06.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen all at once I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.190" end="00:39:08.080" style="s2">what I have now years later but I write</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.089" end="00:40:56.109" style="s2">works for everyone but now I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.730" end="00:40:57.819" style="s2">figure out how to get it out there with</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.109" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">my neurodiversity with not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.819" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">learn new skills like Jake I should</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:01.869" style="s2">really want some public speaking I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">should learn how to edit video I should</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.869" end="00:41:06.809" style="s2">learn how to do these things so this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:08.440" style="s2">the level that I&#39;m at is like my current</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.809" end="00:41:10.180" style="s2">intellectual though I do put new</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.440" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">information in because I can every</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.180" end="00:41:14.470" style="s2">conversation I have helps me grow until</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.470" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">information in the same at the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.140" end="00:41:24.279" style="s2">capacity I was only able to rely Cree</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:25.569" style="s2">mix the information I did have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.279" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">how I created the world that works for</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:31.390" style="s2">and so now I&#39;m in those limitations in</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.319" end="00:41:33.039" style="s2">my same brain having to communicate it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.390" end="00:41:34.450" style="s2">to the world having to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.039" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">does this look like to work for my</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.450" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">position and realizing that our</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:38.890" style="s2">neurodiverse not just mine</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:41.049" style="s2">neurodiversity but everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.890" end="00:41:44.520" style="s2">neurodiversity is how we create a world</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.049" end="00:41:47.109" style="s2">that works for everyone because our</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:48.460" style="s2">diversity in our in our in everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.109" end="00:41:50.500" style="s2">and the way our brain works and where</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.460" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">our bodies work and our similarities and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.500" end="00:41:59.650" style="s2">those same things are how we fuel the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:42:01.190" style="s2">coming necessary revolution that in my</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.650" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">mind is peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.190" end="00:42:09.460" style="s2">to abundance because it gives us</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:14.450" style="s2">everything if we all have the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.460" end="00:42:16.069" style="s2">goals and dreams in mind if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.450" end="00:42:17.270" style="s2">wanted to go to Paris at Christmas it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.069" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t work because everyone want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.270" end="00:42:23.569" style="s2">go to Paris Christmas if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:25.430" style="s2">wanted to - if everybody want to do the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.569" end="00:42:26.990" style="s2">same thing we couldn&#39;t do it but because</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.430" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">we have a diversity of talents and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.990" end="00:42:31.190" style="s2">diversity of challenges it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:35.390" style="s2">the connection between us that works</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.190" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">there is no task that isn&#39;t somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.390" end="00:42:39.619" style="s2">genius and somebody&#39;s passion and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:40.790" style="s2">literally any task because when I first</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.619" end="00:42:42.740" style="s2">started to explain this to people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.790" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">like like yeah there&#39;s tasks that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.740" end="00:42:46.220" style="s2">wants to do like cleaning toilets that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:47.780" style="s2">everybody&#39;s first task and the first</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.220" end="00:42:50.750" style="s2">person I said that to was like I like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.780" end="00:42:53.780" style="s2">cleaning toilets freaking kidding me how</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.750" end="00:42:55.940" style="s2">does that even possible and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.780" end="00:42:58.099" style="s2">kind of the one of the big issues is</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.940" end="00:42:59.960" style="s2">that we think everyone is simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.099" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">like us and not like us so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.960" end="00:43:03.710" style="s2">because I don&#39;t like cleaning bathrooms</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:05.480" style="s2">nobody likes any bathrooms and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.710" end="00:43:06.619" style="s2">not true I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna live</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.480" end="00:43:08.420" style="s2">in a world where someone&#39;s gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.619" end="00:43:10.670" style="s2">clean your bathroom necessarily for you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.420" end="00:43:11.960" style="s2">but in the public spaces and hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.670" end="00:43:14.920" style="s2">and stuff if there&#39;s people want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.960" end="00:43:17.510" style="s2">clean it awesome and so it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.920" end="00:43:19.339" style="s2">uniqueness and the more we let society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.510" end="00:43:21.710" style="s2">version of our uniqueness fall away</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.339" end="00:43:24.589" style="s2">there was a ton of stuff I know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.710" end="00:43:27.980" style="s2">still sure there&#39;s a ton of stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.589" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t really like it I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.980" end="00:43:33.380" style="s2">supposed to like it like and then I</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:35.030" style="s2">realized how much that&#39;s ingrained in me</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.380" end="00:43:37.220" style="s2">when I see other people who I think are</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.030" end="00:43:39.050" style="s2">authentically enjoying what I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.220" end="00:43:43.310" style="s2">and I&#39;m like but you&#39;re faking it right</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.050" end="00:43:45.079" style="s2">now I saw kids adults at Ko house that</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.890" end="00:43:53.869" style="s2">like yeah no like I&#39;m the one asking to</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.869" end="00:43:58.339" style="s2">sports and I never I felt like I was in</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.970" end="00:44:00.410" style="s2">sports of baking it and I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.339" end="00:44:02.060" style="s2">really don&#39;t like that like I I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.410" end="00:44:06.550" style="s2">other people do that with my kid it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.790" end="00:44:16.370" style="s2">was supposed to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.900" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">I was supposed to pretend to like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.370" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">is it supposed to be there&#39;s a geek</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:21.530" style="s2">because I am a geek there was a geek</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:23.420" style="s2">culture that I was like no I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.530" end="00:44:25.010" style="s2">not really that like Star Wars not</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.420" end="00:44:27.560" style="s2">really that into it like it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.010" end="00:44:29.510" style="s2">a story that speaks to me I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.560" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2">liked it and allowed it to be in my in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.510" end="00:44:33.290" style="s2">my yeah okay cool yeah let&#39;s watch Star</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.340" end="00:44:35.240" style="s2">Wars again as such because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.290" end="00:44:36.860" style="s2">you did is a geek culture whereas Star</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.240" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">Trek I didn&#39;t really like because it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.860" end="00:44:40.280" style="s2">like my dad&#39;s show that I had to watch</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:43.370" style="s2">because he was watching it and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.280" end="00:44:47.590" style="s2">watching it is actually yes actually I</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.370" end="00:44:51.020" style="s2">like space very learning new things</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.590" end="00:44:57.140" style="s2">letting go because if we all think like</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.020" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">golf I think is a great example a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.140" end="00:45:02.270" style="s2">people really do love playing golf it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:04.850" style="s2">it is they enjoy the process of it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.270" end="00:45:06.710" style="s2">however there&#39;s a ton of people who play</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.850" end="00:45:08.540" style="s2">golf because of the business connection</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.710" end="00:45:10.340" style="s2">right because you&#39;re business people eat</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.540" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">people want to play it so you go out and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.340" end="00:45:13.550" style="s2">play it that&#39;s not you enjoying it so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:15.320" style="s2">all those people on the greens paying</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.090" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">the sport and watch it even if nobody</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.890" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">like if somehow we still have the NHL or</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">the NFL or the NBA without millions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:34.070" style="s2">people watching right you were the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:36.290" style="s2">one who watched it what would you do if</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.070" end="00:45:38.300" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t popular what would you do if</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.290" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">it was popular and finding that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.300" end="00:45:41.630" style="s2">combination find you know would I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">this if everyone else was against it</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.630" end="00:45:45.830" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:48.440" style="s2">concentrate on would I do this if would</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.830" end="00:45:51.320" style="s2">I like this just because everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.440" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">likes it like does that change my my</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.320" end="00:45:56.600" style="s2">opinion of it and there&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:59.120" style="s2">Harry Potter I love clearly it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.600" end="00:45:59.870" style="s2">popular I would love it even if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.120" end="00:46:03.230" style="s2">wasn&#39;t popular</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.870" end="00:46:04.700" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t necessarily able to talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.230" end="00:46:06.110" style="s2">about a tour they wouldn&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.700" end="00:46:07.190" style="s2">culturally appropriate right people</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.110" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.190" end="00:46:10.730" style="s2">if I referenced Harry Potter like we</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.050" style="s2">usually do I&#39;d say what a muggle is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.730" end="00:46:15.860" style="s2">right like most people know what that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.050" end="00:46:18.470" style="s2">means but I would still like it because</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.860" end="00:46:19.100" style="s2">I enjoy it it&#39;s not I didn&#39;t force that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.470" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">on myself</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.100" end="00:46:23.390" style="s2">whereas Star Wars I would never ever</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:26.630" style="s2">watch it unless someone else put it we</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.390" end="00:46:28.670" style="s2">might put it on and so what do I seek</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.630" end="00:46:31.279" style="s2">out what brings me joy</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.670" end="00:46:33.640" style="s2">and although it took me a longer time to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.279" end="00:46:36.470" style="s2">get there with my intellectual pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.640" end="00:46:40.099" style="s2">what do I want to do if it&#39;s gonna cost</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:58.950" style="s2">it is that how we can how we can dive</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.270" end="00:49:01.020" style="s2">into them how they actually do help</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.210" end="00:49:07.620" style="s2">answer but there&#39;s many ways to answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.890" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">it and having those tools in common and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.620" end="00:49:10.410" style="s2">having those ways in common because any</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">level you answer that pays for itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.410" end="00:49:13.650" style="s2">and then it&#39;s its own internal reward</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:14.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was saying in general mr.</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.650" end="00:49:16.920" style="s2">Lord</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.130" end="00:49:18.780" style="s2">that I have to wait for the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.920" end="00:49:20.130" style="s2">to hit me so I have to wait til I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.780" end="00:49:23.940" style="s2">the urge to clean my house to clean my</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.130" end="00:49:25.620" style="s2">house or I&#39;m like my what I call is my</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.940" end="00:49:27.480" style="s2">spoons being on sale it&#39;s like when</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.620" end="00:49:30.270" style="s2">something&#39;s on sale it&#39;s 50% off you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.480" end="00:49:33.090" style="s2">like I&#39;m five of them if I wait till I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.270" end="00:49:34.710" style="s2">have the internal motivation it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.090" end="00:49:37.260" style="s2">easier to do anything when I push</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.710" end="00:49:39.720" style="s2">anything with external motivation like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.260" end="00:49:42.630" style="s2">want a clean house I really do function</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.720" end="00:49:46.200" style="s2">better in a clean house and I push it I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.630" end="00:49:47.880" style="s2">pay for it every single time and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.200" end="00:49:50.040" style="s2">learned that I have to wait from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.880" end="00:49:51.930" style="s2">internal motivation and that what a gift</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.040" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">that is because when you figure out your</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.930" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">internal motivation there&#39;s no external</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">motivation that counteracts that there</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:02.310" style="s2">is no opinion by somebody outside of me</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.520" end="00:50:04.710" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take my my self identity away</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.310" end="00:50:06.690" style="s2">because I know because constantly as</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.710" end="00:50:08.580" style="s2">people make opinions I get triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.690" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">it sometimes and then I&#39;m like where do</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.580" end="00:50:11.940" style="s2">I find that piece where do I find that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:14.250" style="s2">piece alright my krumping generally not</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.940" end="00:50:17.220" style="s2">rub me as it like as right now in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.250" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">moment or an individual overall both or</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.220" end="00:50:22.620" style="s2">no I&#39;m not grumpy right now and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:24.690" style="s2">grumpy all the time but I do get grumpy</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.620" end="00:50:28.650" style="s2">I mean I have chronic pain have</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.690" end="00:50:33.620" style="s2">exhaustion anyone happy not get some</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.650" end="00:50:37.110" style="s2">gets grumpy but because I have again my</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.620" end="00:50:39.690" style="s2">level of patience has had to go up and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.110" end="00:50:41.160" style="s2">up and up especially with my kid whereas</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.690" end="00:50:41.790" style="s2">my conditions have gotten worse and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.160" end="00:50:44.370" style="s2">worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.790" end="00:50:46.440" style="s2">and so to the outside it kind of looks</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.370" end="00:50:48.600" style="s2">like a plateau but I know if I ever am</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.440" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">able to get rid of my fatigue and pain</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.600" end="00:50:53.610" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have the patience of a freakin</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:55.380" style="s2">saint because it&#39;s like it&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.610" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">kind of have to develop when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.380" end="00:51:00.510" style="s2">chronic fatigue and chronic pain you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">can&#39;t treat everybody horribly all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.510" end="00:51:04.140" style="s2">time and I don&#39;t it&#39;s the one I&#39;m in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">lowest place so every day basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.140" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">every day I am okay in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">by the evening I&#39;m a friggin witch and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:13.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s like finding the tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:15.510" style="s2">able to mitigate that as a parent to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.260" end="00:51:16.770" style="s2">able to say okay well I can I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.770" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">pretty pretty extreme and get into</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.780" end="00:51:23.160" style="s2">places where I can be bitchy and I know</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">when to take time to myself and when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.160" end="00:51:26.700" style="s2">overwhelmed and how to not spend my</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:28.620" style="s2">spoons and I&#39;m still learning constantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.700" end="00:51:29.970" style="s2">there&#39;s still times all the time where I</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.620" end="00:51:34.020" style="s2">spend too many spoons and then I crash</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.970" end="00:51:36.450" style="s2">for a week or I take too many I just do</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.530" end="00:51:50.850" style="s2">be on here because the reason I&#39;m on</p>
