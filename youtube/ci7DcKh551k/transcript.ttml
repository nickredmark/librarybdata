<p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:44.120" style="s2">to record the first part that was going</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.440" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">to give like a talk about 20 men talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.120" end="00:01:49.340" style="s2">introducing the modality and then we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:01:49.340" end="00:01:53.390" style="s2">stop the record button when we go into</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.020" end="00:01:57.860" style="s2">the exercise so that being said I will</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.390" end="00:02:02.260" style="s2">hand it over to you Doug and you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.860" end="00:02:02.260" style="s2">mute again I&#39;m see if i unmuted you</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.010" end="00:02:17.890" style="s2">for me I&#39;m always interested in exposing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:20.350" style="s2">new people to this way of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.890" end="00:02:22.140" style="s2">world and what&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.350" end="00:02:24.520" style="s2">interesting is that I&#39;m coming to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.140" end="00:02:27.940" style="s2">forum that has a particular way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.520" end="00:02:30.520" style="s2">seeing the world and I&#39;m kind of curious</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.940" end="00:02:33.640" style="s2">to see if there&#39;s any clashes or if this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.520" end="00:02:36.460" style="s2">is a complementary kind of approach just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.640" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">being stoic and being you know embracing</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.460" end="00:02:44.170" style="s2">stoicism and part partly because I kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:47.080" style="s2">of AB lived these things I know what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.170" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">important points are but it really helps</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.080" end="00:02:52.960" style="s2">me to know kind of who my audience is so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:55.060" style="s2">what I&#39;d like if you don&#39;t mind before I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.960" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">start riffing in a particular direction</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.060" end="00:03:00.700" style="s2">is if I can get like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:01.480" style="s2">people to give me like a thirty second</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.700" end="00:03:05.020" style="s2">to a minute</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.480" end="00:03:07.390" style="s2">kind of what it what brought you here</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.020" end="00:03:09.190" style="s2">and what are you hoping to get from this</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.390" end="00:03:11.020" style="s2">if you can just give me some idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.190" end="00:03:13.480" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside your mind in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.020" end="00:03:15.720" style="s2">worlds and I&#39;ll assume that three to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.480" end="00:03:18.190" style="s2">five people is a representative sample</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.720" end="00:03:20.890" style="s2">not that it really is but it&#39;ll give me</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">something to kind of resonate with so if</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.890" end="00:03:25.750" style="s2">if we want to put up you guys know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:27.550" style="s2">to put up your hands you can raise your</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.750" end="00:03:31.270" style="s2">hand if you open up the participants</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.550" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">window and if you do that I should get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.270" end="00:03:36.100" style="s2">list of people popping up to the top so</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:38.500" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind sharing with me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.100" end="00:03:41.890" style="s2">the group what brings you here and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.500" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">you&#39;re hoping to get from it I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.890" end="00:03:46.090" style="s2">appreciate it so while people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">considering that and the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.090" end="00:03:51.070" style="s2">we&#39;re going to record this first part</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:52.450" style="s2">and then when it comes to the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.070" end="00:03:55.180" style="s2">where we might get into some</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.450" end="00:03:57.250" style="s2">experiential sharing we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.180" end="00:04:00.489" style="s2">sure that that&#39;s not available to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.250" end="00:04:02.530" style="s2">public okay so you can you can share</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.489" end="00:04:05.590" style="s2">here I imagine this isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.530" end="00:04:07.150" style="s2">too revealing in this first part we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.590" end="00:04:08.860" style="s2">gonna record my talk and then when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.150" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">comes to the exercise we&#39;re gonna either</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.860" end="00:04:12.310" style="s2">stop recording it or just reassure you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:14.350" style="s2">that we will not be distributing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.310" end="00:04:17.079" style="s2">anywhere okay does everyone agree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.350" end="00:04:19.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s all good and comfort and great</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.079" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">see a lot of nodding heads</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.180" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">Supt is good too so Jonathan if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">don&#39;t mind sharing what you&#39;ve heard and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">what you&#39;re hoping to get from this that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">would be wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:36.810" style="s2">Hey so I&#39;m actually decently familiar</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:39.340" style="s2">with your work mostly from friends have</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.810" end="00:04:45.630" style="s2">been more directly involved like</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.340" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">tattooed somewhere on the originator</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.630" end="00:04:51.820" style="s2">Sauron originator and and I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">done like prototypical attempts at doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.820" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">this work on my own I mean each time I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">go to something you hold I seem to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">like another piece of the puzzle for my</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.630" end="00:05:03.190" style="s2">own thing so it&#39;s been valuable in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:05.860" style="s2">sense I&#39;m trying to move through some</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.190" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">feelings right now and use all the help</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.990" end="00:07:11.940" style="s2">appreciate that there are productive and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.480" end="00:07:14.220" style="s2">healthy ways of crying and processing</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.940" end="00:07:15.780" style="s2">your feelings and there are unhealthy</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">just know that this is a very useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:31.560" style="s2">heuristic okay and and I&#39;ll explain how</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:33.660" style="s2">I got the nine core feelings after</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.560" end="00:07:36.690" style="s2">they&#39;re actually research-based but</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:38.970" style="s2">there&#39;s still it still new this is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.690" end="00:07:41.210" style="s2">emerging framework but I I have just</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.970" end="00:07:44.100" style="s2">really come to appreciate the potency of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:45.660" style="s2">seeing the emotional world through this</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.100" end="00:07:49.530" style="s2">lens and how it can make such a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.660" end="00:07:51.240" style="s2">difference in our both physical while</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.530" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">our mental and our physical health and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.240" end="00:07:58.590" style="s2">our social health so and in my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:08:01.320" style="s2">practice once Corona started probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.590" end="00:08:03.450" style="s2">increased by 50% and and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.320" end="00:08:04.950" style="s2">because all the people have been putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.450" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">off who knew about the work and been</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.950" end="00:08:08.700" style="s2">putting off it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:10.830" style="s2">right time it&#39;s like it was just in</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.700" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">their face it&#39;s like I can&#39;t avoid this</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.830" end="00:08:13.770" style="s2">anymore and I&#39;ve had some really</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.380" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.770" end="00:08:17.009" style="s2">you know people doing some very intense</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.380" end="00:08:20.039" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.009" end="00:08:22.139" style="s2">and getting the benefits from it so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.039" end="00:08:24.029" style="s2">is a wonderful opportunity to do the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.139" end="00:08:26.279" style="s2">introspective work and this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.029" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">wonderful tool to to do it with so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.279" end="00:08:32.070" style="s2">hopefully by the end of the session you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:34.669" style="s2">guys will also be agreeing with me so</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.070" end="00:08:40.860" style="s2">thanks for sharing Andrew and thank you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.669" end="00:08:43.589" style="s2">Raven if you could share yeah hi hi Doug</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">thanks for being here um so how did I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.589" end="00:08:47.130" style="s2">hear about this I&#39;m really naive to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:48.990" style="s2">process I don&#39;t really know much not</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.130" end="00:08:52.339" style="s2">much about it but I have a friend who</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.990" end="00:08:54.660" style="s2">went to the monastic Academy for their</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.339" end="00:08:58.470" style="s2">pre-apprenticeship program and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.660" end="00:09:01.050" style="s2">specifically told me that the bio</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.470" end="00:09:02.970" style="s2">emotive workshops for him were really</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.050" end="00:09:06.029" style="s2">catalyzed thing of like emotional growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.970" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">and change and that he thought I</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.029" end="00:09:12.060" style="s2">specifically would be able to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">through things using this method I and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.060" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">like you know I have a hearsay because</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.149" style="s2">he told me what he experienced and now I</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:21.329" style="s2">have a fuzzy kind of recollection of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.149" end="00:09:23.699" style="s2">what he said but I think I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.329" end="00:09:26.760" style="s2">intellectual and so I intellectualize my</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.699" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">emotional states and I feel like in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.760" end="00:09:33.000" style="s2">ways I&#39;ve just reached an endpoint of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:35.970" style="s2">being able to actually process what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.000" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">going on and in an anterior way and so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.970" end="00:09:40.829" style="s2">think I&#39;m interested in new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:44.790" style="s2">accessing my inner world and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.829" end="00:09:46.790" style="s2">like this this method has that potential</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.790" end="00:09:50.279" style="s2">to it so that&#39;s why I&#39;m here today</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.010" end="00:10:11.009" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.269" end="00:12:10.439" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a lot to cover and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.699" end="00:12:14.249" style="s2">gonna start talking and one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.439" end="00:12:15.899" style="s2">things that and and I I don&#39;t know Peter</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.249" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re letting people in because</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.899" end="00:12:21.780" style="s2">I&#39;ve let some people into there</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:23.790" style="s2">a concept that I want to introduce you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.780" end="00:12:26.100" style="s2">to most of you haven&#39;t heard of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.790" end="00:12:29.430" style="s2">word and if you have it&#39;s usually in an</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.100" end="00:12:31.550" style="s2">individual context but I when I first</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.430" end="00:12:34.290" style="s2">started getting into clinical work I</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.550" end="00:12:38.850" style="s2">really I done work in an area called</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.290" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">culture or called alexithymia and Alexa</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.850" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">findings were something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:45.240" style="s2">actually in interesting the concept came</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:49.770" style="s2">out of Toronto by a researcher I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.240" end="00:12:52.380" style="s2">his name was Taylor and he measured</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.770" end="00:12:55.260" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to to process their</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.380" end="00:12:59.010" style="s2">emotions and he had a scale and on that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.260" end="00:13:01.410" style="s2">scale if you took it about 15% of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.010" end="00:13:03.720" style="s2">would be considered alexa thymic so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.410" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">was a toronto alexithymia scale the TAS</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.720" end="00:13:08.550" style="s2">and I used that for quite a number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:10.920" style="s2">years but as a researcher when I</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.550" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">actually went into clinical work and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.920" end="00:13:15.450" style="s2">was working with people trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:17.460" style="s2">them do I was using a again ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.450" end="00:13:20.610" style="s2">focusing technique but I was really</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.460" end="00:13:22.740" style="s2">helping people get to the tears it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.610" end="00:13:25.050" style="s2">really clear that when I asked the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.740" end="00:13:28.950" style="s2">question to people what are you feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.050" end="00:13:31.350" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t answer it they were giving</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.950" end="00:13:33.000" style="s2">me stories about it they&#39;d stayed while</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.350" end="00:13:35.580" style="s2">I feel and then they&#39;d give me a story</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.000" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">and they&#39;d give me behavioral analogues</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.580" end="00:13:42.690" style="s2">or metaphors but almost nobody talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:44.460" style="s2">about their feelings and so I I come up</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.690" end="00:13:47.850" style="s2">with this concept of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.460" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">alexithymia and it basically means</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.850" end="00:13:57.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem somewhere in either</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.750" end="00:14:07.320" style="s2">okay so alexithymia where we as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.980" end="00:14:09.780" style="s2">researcher would think 10 to 15 percent</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.320" end="00:14:13.080" style="s2">of the population has alexithymia or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.780" end="00:14:15.900" style="s2">some trouble with you know processing</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.900" end="00:14:21.840" style="s2">clinician was it was more like 85 90 95</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.340" end="00:14:25.530" style="s2">percent of people were deficit in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.840" end="00:14:30.350" style="s2">area and there is an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.530" end="00:14:32.660" style="s2">that for for more theoretical context I</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.350" end="00:14:35.750" style="s2">use the concept</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.660" end="00:14:37.879" style="s2">the triune brain as a good metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.750" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">the kind of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.879" end="00:14:42.589" style="s2">approaching the world so Paul MacLean</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:44.420" style="s2">was a brilliant researcher that in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.589" end="00:14:46.879" style="s2">70s came up with this triune brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.420" end="00:14:49.100" style="s2">concept and more and more researchers</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.879" end="00:14:51.589" style="s2">are embracing it there we know that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.100" end="00:14:53.990" style="s2">brain is modular exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.589" end="00:14:57.079" style="s2">modules are everybody argues about but</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.990" end="00:14:59.420" style="s2">the bigger set of picture the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.079" end="00:15:02.629" style="s2">picture is that we&#39;ve got a physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.420" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">brain an emotional brain and an</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.629" end="00:15:07.370" style="s2">intellectual brain now they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:09.470" style="s2">highly interconnected but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.370" end="00:15:12.259" style="s2">modules we seem to have these three</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.470" end="00:15:14.439" style="s2">independent networks that are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.259" end="00:15:17.420" style="s2">the world through a different lens and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.439" end="00:15:19.790" style="s2">so he called them the reptilian the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.420" end="00:15:23.149" style="s2">mammalian and the Neo mammalian and some</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.790" end="00:15:25.189" style="s2">other you know words but basically it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.149" end="00:15:27.189" style="s2">comes down to and this was based on like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.189" end="00:15:29.389" style="s2">30 years of research right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.189" end="00:15:32.029" style="s2">neuroanatomical maps and studying</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.389" end="00:15:33.949" style="s2">animals fur like in their brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.029" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">structures but it comes down to we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.949" end="00:15:39.769" style="s2">a physical brain that looks after our</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:42.459" style="s2">body and then on top of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.769" end="00:15:45.709" style="s2">the reptilian brain so it regulates</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.459" end="00:15:48.410" style="s2">heart rate and digestion and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.709" end="00:15:51.139" style="s2">basic survival stuff we&#39;ve got an a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.410" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">limbic brain or an emotional brain that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.139" end="00:15:57.500" style="s2">looks after what I refer to as our</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:16:01.540" style="s2">relational dynamics okay and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.500" end="00:16:05.230" style="s2">where mammals come in that fight flight</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.540" end="00:16:08.329" style="s2">dominance hierarchy starts to organize</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.230" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">animals into groups so that a pack of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.329" end="00:16:13.880" style="s2">wolves can bring down a caribou that an</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:16.430" style="s2">individual animal can&#39;t and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.880" end="00:16:20.259" style="s2">hierarchy that comes from the anger</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.430" end="00:16:23.089" style="s2">fight component and the submission that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.259" end="00:16:24.949" style="s2">organizes that activity and then once</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.089" end="00:16:26.569" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the group&#39;s there&#39;s bonding</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.949" end="00:16:29.480" style="s2">and everything so you get both the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.569" end="00:16:33.860" style="s2">social and survival and social emotions</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.480" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">there and that basically is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.860" end="00:16:39.470" style="s2">rudimentary form of communication it</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:41.660" style="s2">allows groups to form and communicate</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.470" end="00:16:43.550" style="s2">and work together and that&#39;s mammals</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.660" end="00:16:46.490" style="s2">pretty much all mammals that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.550" end="00:16:49.670" style="s2">can bond with dogs because they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.490" end="00:16:51.470" style="s2">that emotional ring and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.670" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">bond in the same way with the reptile</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.470" end="00:16:59.149" style="s2">and if you feel really bonded to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:17:01.510" style="s2">reptile that&#39;s wonderful but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.149" end="00:17:03.860" style="s2">sure the reptile feels bonded to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.510" end="00:17:06.110" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have the structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.860" end="00:17:07.429" style="s2">that allow that kind of processing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.110" end="00:17:10.939" style="s2">take place there may be some exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.429" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">but in general mammals have a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.939" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">specific bonding and group relational</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.920" style="s2">kind of status that they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:20.780" style="s2">processing and then the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.920" end="00:17:24.500" style="s2">brain which is characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.780" end="00:17:28.250" style="s2">primates formed and allowed us to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.500" end="00:17:31.390" style="s2">about the world the other ones are just</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.250" end="00:17:35.380" style="s2">very much being in the world and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.390" end="00:17:38.150" style="s2">trichotomy actually kind of gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.380" end="00:17:41.330" style="s2">rediscovered and formed into different</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.150" end="00:17:44.210" style="s2">ways of seeing the world every ten or</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.330" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">fifteen or a hundred years so when I</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.210" end="00:17:48.470" style="s2">went to school we informally talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">about the Nerds</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.470" end="00:17:55.670" style="s2">you know the academics the jocks and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">artsy types and that corresponds to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.670" end="00:18:02.090" style="s2">physical brain dominant ones the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:03.860" style="s2">emotionally dominant ones and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.090" end="00:18:06.200" style="s2">intellectually dominant ones even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.860" end="00:18:11.030" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say in that order and we see</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.200" end="00:18:13.550" style="s2">that in Buddhism we&#39;ve got body speech</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.030" end="00:18:17.030" style="s2">and mind which corresponds to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.550" end="00:18:19.309" style="s2">physical the the speech when it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.030" end="00:18:21.920" style="s2">right is an emotional expressive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.309" end="00:18:25.880" style="s2">process and the mind is the intellect</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.920" end="00:18:27.530" style="s2">and and we see these ways of seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.880" end="00:18:29.900" style="s2">world I&#39;ve got a blog where I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.530" end="00:18:33.860" style="s2">another five or ten different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.900" end="00:18:36.050" style="s2">how this triune structure of our human</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:40.190" style="s2">condition shows up in our world in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.050" end="00:18:42.470" style="s2">different ways and our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.190" end="00:18:46.090" style="s2">extremely biased towards nurturing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.470" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">physical so we got strong athletes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.090" end="00:18:51.640" style="s2">surgeons right and we nurture the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:55.220" style="s2">intellect with all of our years of echod</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.640" end="00:18:58.340" style="s2">academic training but the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.220" end="00:18:59.390" style="s2">system gets very little explicit</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.340" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.390" end="00:19:03.799" style="s2">if you know the best we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2">encourage the arts you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.799" end="00:19:09.860" style="s2">dance and expression nowadays and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:12.530" style="s2">know modern art is it modern dance is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.860" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">very expressive but we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.530" end="00:19:16.520" style="s2">understand the emotional system to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:20.650" style="s2">level that we understand the other two</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.520" end="00:19:25.400" style="s2">systems now I make an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.650" end="00:19:27.799" style="s2">because I was very confused by why if</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.400" end="00:19:29.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved through the physical</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.799" end="00:19:32.630" style="s2">emotional and intellectual brains and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:34.490" style="s2">we&#39;re all into this intellect why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.630" end="00:19:36.080" style="s2">we have a better understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.490" end="00:19:38.630" style="s2">emotional brain if this is something</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.080" end="00:19:40.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve already bought through and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.630" end="00:19:42.530" style="s2">where I really was excited to come up</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.850" end="00:19:45.380" style="s2">with well I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.530" end="00:19:48.200" style="s2">integral my my wife Darlene who is on</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.380" end="00:19:51.620" style="s2">this call I saw her smiling and I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.200" end="00:19:53.570" style="s2">see her picture there we taught integral</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.620" end="00:19:55.370" style="s2">theory we got involved with it in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.570" end="00:19:57.290" style="s2">90s and we taught integral theory to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.370" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">group in Selkirk for a vote in her nine</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.290" end="00:20:02.679" style="s2">years and part of integral theory is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:05.900" style="s2">this embrace of evolutionary development</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.679" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">that human beings go through stages of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.900" end="00:20:13.070" style="s2">development and what in a theory that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.940" end="00:20:16.460" style="s2">put together that&#39;s a slight variation</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.070" end="00:20:19.130" style="s2">of acqua integral I call it Eva Kor</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.460" end="00:20:22.790" style="s2">evolving brains and quadrants and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">presented this in 2010 at a conference</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.790" end="00:20:34.010" style="s2">for integral theory the basic tenet is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">that our developmental stages kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.010" end="00:20:39.160" style="s2">through the physical brain the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:43.040" style="s2">brain and the intellectual brain and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.160" end="00:20:46.850" style="s2">that the traditional or the how many</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.040" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">people are familiar with in integral and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.850" end="00:20:52.190" style="s2">spiral dynamics if you can just raise</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:55.179" style="s2">your hands yeah most people are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.190" end="00:21:00.740" style="s2">people are which is wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.179" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">so the the basic gist is that we know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.740" end="00:21:09.820" style="s2">that the blue stage of development which</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:09.820" style="s2">I refer to is traditional</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.990" end="00:21:17.549" style="s2">really it&#39;s about rules and roles and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.130" end="00:21:19.470" style="s2">I grew up in the 50s 60s and I caught</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.549" end="00:21:20.940" style="s2">the end of the 50s which was very</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.470" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">traditional in terms of how our</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.940" end="00:21:26.220" style="s2">households were structured and how we</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:28.529" style="s2">treated women and children and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.220" end="00:21:32.549" style="s2">I would hear things like kids should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.529" end="00:21:35.029" style="s2">seen and not heard you know the man is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.549" end="00:21:37.590" style="s2">the king of his man&#39;s home is his castle</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.029" end="00:21:40.649" style="s2">women should be barefoot pregnant and in</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.590" end="00:21:42.059" style="s2">the kitchen and we were kind of appalled</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.649" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">at some of these things now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.059" end="00:21:47.960" style="s2">follow these but these aphorisms were</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:51.029" style="s2">ways of training people into their roles</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.960" end="00:21:53.159" style="s2">right like as a kid you were just told</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.029" end="00:21:56.850" style="s2">kids should be seen and not heard so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.159" end="00:22:00.600" style="s2">being told what my role is women are</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.850" end="00:22:03.059" style="s2">told what their role is and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.600" end="00:22:06.210" style="s2">structure of development works because</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.059" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">everyone plays their role but if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.210" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">start introducing emotions to that like</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:16.049" style="s2">do you get to be depressed and make the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.990" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">meals for your husband you can&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.049" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">if you don&#39;t make your meals husband</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:22.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t eat husband doesn&#39;t go out to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:24.390" style="s2">the farm and work you know or on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.500" end="00:22:25.289" style="s2">field or whatever he&#39;s doing everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.390" end="00:22:28.020" style="s2">falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.289" end="00:22:30.990" style="s2">if the man gets depressed and can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.020" end="00:22:33.029" style="s2">can&#39;t fulfill his role it falls apart so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.990" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">for the most part emotions were</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.029" end="00:22:37.620" style="s2">extremely suppressed and how many people</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:40.770" style="s2">are if you&#39;re old enough to have heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.620" end="00:22:42.539" style="s2">the phrase you want something to cry you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.770" end="00:22:44.029" style="s2">know you&#39;re gonna cry I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.539" end="00:22:49.409" style="s2">something to cry about</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.029" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">put up your hand like and and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.409" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">amazing is like how many of you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">from North America I&#39;ve had people in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:59.100" style="s2">Sweden put up their hand and Europe put</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:02.520" style="s2">up man I go how the hell does a mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.100" end="00:23:05.669" style="s2">like that spread around the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.520" end="00:23:08.279" style="s2">without anybody being conscious of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.669" end="00:23:10.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s there across all the cultures</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.279" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna cry oh give you something</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.110" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">to cry about and I was literally spanked</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">until I stopped crying that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:20.279" style="s2">would stop getting spanked</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:22.809" style="s2">I was literally taught I had to suppress</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.279" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">my emotions to survive</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.809" end="00:23:31.620" style="s2">so that was traditional we then moved</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">into orange modern individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.620" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">emotions just get in the way of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">achievement they interfere with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.169" style="s2">ability to a function so you suppress</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:43.629" style="s2">them plus you know you&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.169" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">individual mode so emotions don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.629" end="00:23:51.009" style="s2">have a role it&#39;s not till we get to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:54.190" style="s2">post-modernism that suddenly we care</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.009" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">about having a deep relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.190" end="00:24:02.019" style="s2">people so how many people here are</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:06.100" style="s2">looking for or in a relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.019" end="00:24:08.759" style="s2">they want a deep soulful connection with</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.100" end="00:24:08.759" style="s2">their partner</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.040" end="00:24:15.510" style="s2">now almost everybody&#39;s putting up their</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.380" end="00:24:18.030" style="s2">hand if you would have asked that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.510" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">question in the 50s and 60s people would</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.030" end="00:24:22.860" style="s2">have said what the hell are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:26.580" style="s2">about that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.860" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">like that man makes enough money</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.580" end="00:24:32.250" style="s2">he&#39;s got good teeth and a healthy body</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:34.500" style="s2">you know he&#39;ll be a good person to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.250" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">offspring with and and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.500" end="00:24:39.510" style="s2">arranged marriages work in that rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">that level of development because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.510" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">looking for a role the individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter so we&#39;ve moved into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:51.150" style="s2">postmodern context where we want</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:53.040" style="s2">individual we want to be individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.150" end="00:24:56.190" style="s2">we want to know the other individual and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.040" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">what&#39;s the best question to ask somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.190" end="00:25:01.260" style="s2">if you want to know about their soul if</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:07.250" style="s2">you want to know about the depths of who</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.260" end="00:25:07.250" style="s2">they are well how do you feel about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.900" end="00:25:17.050" style="s2">right what&#39;s going on with the all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.000" end="00:25:19.300" style="s2">protests in North America you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.050" end="00:25:22.330" style="s2">really get to know someone you say how</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.300" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">do you feel about the protests whereas</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.330" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">in traditional it would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.860" style="s2">those people out there they shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.700" end="00:25:31.990" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s wrong they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.860" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">disrupting society right there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.990" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">really one or two answers and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:39.700" style="s2">pretty black-and-white but here if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:42.940" style="s2">asked each individual here how do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.700" end="00:25:45.790" style="s2">feel about the protests I would get very</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.940" end="00:25:48.570" style="s2">different answers and it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.790" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">opportunity for me to get to know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.570" end="00:25:55.510" style="s2">deeply especially if I shared Wow like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:26:00.910" style="s2">that&#39;s very different than how I feel it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.510" end="00:26:03.850" style="s2">it almost is disruptive to hear you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.910" end="00:26:04.390" style="s2">that and I&#39;m curious as to how you got</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.850" end="00:26:07.450" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.390" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">that&#39;s a very postmodern perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.450" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">how many people have done circling</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:17.400" style="s2">and you recognize the kind of tone that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:20.590" style="s2">I portrayed in in that curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.400" end="00:26:23.380" style="s2">non-judgmental curiosity that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.590" end="00:26:25.270" style="s2">the depth of connection without judging</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.380" end="00:26:28.060" style="s2">the other person&#39;s perspectives because</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.270" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">you want to try on that world as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.060" end="00:26:34.990" style="s2">clinician I&#39;ve learned that no matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:37.870" style="s2">how quote crazy somebody appears in</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.990" end="00:26:42.040" style="s2">their actions if I can look out their</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.870" end="00:26:44.230" style="s2">eyes their world starts to make sense if</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.040" end="00:26:46.930" style="s2">I can ask the right questions on how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.230" end="00:26:50.410" style="s2">see this and what you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.930" end="00:26:53.530" style="s2">suddenly their configuration forms and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.410" end="00:26:56.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like wow now I understand why you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.530" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">wanted to X or why or why you did that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.620" end="00:27:02.050" style="s2">it seemed crazy at first but I can see</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:07.270" style="s2">how it makes sense to you so it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:10.920" style="s2">deep feeling exchange that we&#39;re now all</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.270" end="00:27:14.170" style="s2">primed for but don&#39;t have the tools for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.920" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">because if I ask you how you feel about</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.170" end="00:27:21.250" style="s2">X or Y I can almost guarantee most of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">you not give me feelings you&#39;ll give me</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:28.630" style="s2">stories or metaphors or beliefs and some</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:31.930" style="s2">of you who give feelings that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.630" end="00:27:35.710" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not Alexa thymic you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.930" end="00:27:38.200" style="s2">but the the just kind of note that when</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.710" end="00:27:40.330" style="s2">you ask people what they&#39;re feeling see</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.200" end="00:27:42.580" style="s2">if they actually give you feelings I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.330" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">listening in on an expressive therapy</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.580" end="00:27:48.070" style="s2">call the other day and someone said how</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:51.250" style="s2">do you feel about that and I and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.070" end="00:27:53.290" style="s2">nobody actually gave a feeling they all</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.250" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">just started talking it&#39;s like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.290" end="00:27:57.070" style="s2">that these people really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:28:00.010" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:28:01.510" style="s2">well that&#39;s not a feeling right and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.010" end="00:28:03.040" style="s2">you might not even recognize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.510" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">not a feeling but we&#39;ll get to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.040" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">after so I&#39;m gonna pause here for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:10.180" style="s2">moment I&#39;ve covered a lot of ground and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll take some questions and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.180" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">move on to the next little phase so then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.280" end="00:28:15.940" style="s2">you want to have any questions that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:19.240" style="s2">want to clarify just pop your hand up</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.940" end="00:28:21.790" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll clarify that okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.240" end="00:28:23.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve covered a lot of ground and I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.790" end="00:28:24.220" style="s2">wanna and if you don&#39;t have a question</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.230" end="00:28:25.750" style="s2">that at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.220" end="00:28:27.580" style="s2">maybe give me some feedback as to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.750" end="00:28:29.799" style="s2">whether this is making sense or if this</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.580" end="00:28:33.820" style="s2">is if there&#39;s any insights or if this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.799" end="00:28:37.419" style="s2">helping you in any way engine if you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.820" end="00:28:38.789" style="s2">speak thanks Doug</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.419" end="00:28:44.230" style="s2">I was understanding you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.789" end="00:28:46.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a historical mark to us</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.450" end="00:28:51.539" style="s2">have suggested that the lifestyle and</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:02.169" style="s2">particularly encouraged just that more</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.080" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">than what kingly and and I&#39;ll say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.169" end="00:29:05.980" style="s2">not the farming lifestyle so I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">you&#39;re asking for clarification and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.980" end="00:29:13.299" style="s2">is where this is actually the joy of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.370" style="s2">post-modernism is that people will ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.299" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">questions for clarification and you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.370" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">an opportunity because people had live</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:22.750" style="s2">in such different worlds right like in</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:25.179" style="s2">my world what I said was just it made</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.750" end="00:29:27.610" style="s2">sense now you&#39;re hearing it differently</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.179" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">and so I get a chance to you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.610" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">explain the nuances so in North America</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:41.740" style="s2">Canada in the 1950s and earlier probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:45.429" style="s2">80 90 percent of families even in cities</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.740" end="00:29:51.549" style="s2">were one generation removed from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.429" end="00:29:53.169" style="s2">farm that most people had the if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.549" end="00:29:54.490" style="s2">said I&#39;m going to the farm for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.169" end="00:29:57.130" style="s2">weekend people knew what you meant</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.490" end="00:30:00.669" style="s2">because they had a grandpa or a granny</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.130" end="00:30:05.230" style="s2">still living on the farm and there was</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.669" end="00:30:09.640" style="s2">an era where that so that was confounded</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.230" end="00:30:14.110" style="s2">with the developmental 1950s 40s 50s 60s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.640" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">of traditional consciousness and so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.110" end="00:30:20.140" style="s2">can be on a farm now on a commune and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:23.620" style="s2">you got a postmodern embrace of farming</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.140" end="00:30:26.440" style="s2">but back then they were very merged that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.620" end="00:30:29.020" style="s2">the farming kind of mentality the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.440" end="00:30:32.740" style="s2">pioneer mentality was very traditional</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.020" end="00:30:34.750" style="s2">when we landed in North America it was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.740" end="00:30:38.050" style="s2">very traditional consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.750" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">still part of colonialism and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.050" end="00:30:42.670" style="s2">for me those two are synonymous but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:45.220" style="s2">no longer true anymore does that is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.670" end="00:30:46.630" style="s2">making sense to you maybe then I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.220" end="00:30:49.000" style="s2">follow up like could you elaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.630" end="00:30:50.710" style="s2">why emotional suppression is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.000" end="00:30:53.110" style="s2">adaptive and helpful under those</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.710" end="00:30:56.140" style="s2">circumstances because in traditional</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.110" end="00:31:00.250" style="s2">consciousness your obligation is to</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.140" end="00:31:04.540" style="s2">fulfill your role if you&#39;re a husband or</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.250" end="00:31:07.170" style="s2">a worker you just have to do what your</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.540" end="00:31:09.520" style="s2">ex what you&#39;re expected to do and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.170" end="00:31:12.750" style="s2">emotions get in the way of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.520" end="00:31:16.090" style="s2">and you and and emotions are two</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.750" end="00:31:18.910" style="s2">individualizing right they start making</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.090" end="00:31:21.430" style="s2">you unique and so like when the when the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.910" end="00:31:24.520" style="s2">hippies came into being and they grew</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.430" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">hair long that was a radical symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.520" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">protest against the conformity of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">roles that they were expected to step</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:36.820" style="s2">into right so that was their rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:39.670" style="s2">against conforming to the roles I I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.820" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">literally watched my father yell at my</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.670" end="00:31:45.880" style="s2">mother for saying she wanted to get a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:47.680" style="s2">driver&#39;s license why do you need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.880" end="00:31:50.140" style="s2">leave the house what are you going to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.680" end="00:31:52.090" style="s2">I can take you shopping you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.140" end="00:31:54.420" style="s2">remember the crying and the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.090" end="00:31:56.980" style="s2">about it and that was in the 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.420" end="00:31:59.380" style="s2">then you know she eventually got money</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.980" end="00:32:03.270" style="s2">and it was okay but her stepping out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.380" end="00:32:08.890" style="s2">her role was very threatening to him all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.270" end="00:32:11.080" style="s2">thanks long um anyone else besides</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.890" end="00:32:18.370" style="s2">engine everything is crystal clear what</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.080" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">I&#39;m saying anybody want to share that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.370" end="00:32:22.980" style="s2">what I&#39;ve said has been helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:25.300" style="s2">James has just raised his hand so if</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.980" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">James you want to chat that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.300" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">great maybe I happened to space out at</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:37.410" style="s2">the moment that you mention it</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:37.410" style="s2">okay can you speak up a little bit James</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.040" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">a little bit better but still not that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.290" end="00:32:47.590" style="s2">how are you how&#39;s everyone else hearing</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:51.820" style="s2">them yeah it&#39;s too good it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.590" end="00:32:53.020" style="s2">low you know what I will save my quest</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.820" end="00:32:55.380" style="s2">for another time let&#39;s get it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.020" end="00:32:58.300" style="s2">take too long to figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.380" end="00:33:01.870" style="s2">well you I just heard you fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.300" end="00:33:05.950" style="s2">now okay here I go so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.870" end="00:33:08.170" style="s2">about like as you&#39;re talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.950" end="00:33:10.840" style="s2">different sort of states or levels of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.170" end="00:33:13.180" style="s2">consciousness moving from traditional</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.840" end="00:33:15.940" style="s2">into modern sort of role role based</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.180" end="00:33:18.610" style="s2">thinking into something more around</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.940" end="00:33:21.850" style="s2">emotions and individuality I reflected</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.610" end="00:33:24.550" style="s2">myself that I can see how I am</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.850" end="00:33:26.530" style="s2">predominantly in one state of being but</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.550" end="00:33:28.450" style="s2">these other states of being still do</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.530" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">express themselves in different ways so</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.450" end="00:33:31.810" style="s2">I think I want to get maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.530" end="00:33:34.120" style="s2">clarification on whether or not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.810" end="00:33:37.240" style="s2">talking about a progression that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.120" end="00:33:38.770" style="s2">once you&#39;re up you&#39;re up or that we you</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.240" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">know at any given point are always a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.770" end="00:33:43.480" style="s2">moving expression of all the states that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:45.400" style="s2">have come before us as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.480" end="00:33:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s like the number-one question</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.400" end="00:33:50.590" style="s2">plaguing developmental theory and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.400" end="00:33:52.890" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a hierarchical development</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.590" end="00:33:55.900" style="s2">and people are making all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.890" end="00:34:00.220" style="s2">models up to try and explain how it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.900" end="00:34:02.710" style="s2">we can apparently move or digress to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.220" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">lower stages of development and and how</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.710" end="00:34:06.040" style="s2">does that make sense and what I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:07.690" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.040" end="00:34:10.060" style="s2">so people have talked about like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.690" end="00:34:12.580" style="s2">center of gravity where you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.060" end="00:34:15.070" style="s2">in one stage but you&#39;ve got pieces below</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.580" end="00:34:17.710" style="s2">you and pieces above you and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.070" end="00:34:20.490" style="s2">of works I&#39;ve actually started to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.710" end="00:34:25.690" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.490" end="00:34:28.990" style="s2">hierarchical as contextual that a child</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:32.170" style="s2">being born into a postmodern stage of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.990" end="00:34:35.050" style="s2">development is having huge demands made</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.170" end="00:34:39.160" style="s2">on them on how to see the world and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.050" end="00:34:43.360" style="s2">they will start embodying a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.160" end="00:34:46.990" style="s2">rhetoric and persona even if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.360" end="00:34:49.930" style="s2">haven&#39;t individuated fully and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.990" end="00:34:52.180" style="s2">there&#39;s you know it&#39;s very contextual</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.930" end="00:34:54.070" style="s2">when they can have that sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.180" end="00:34:56.500" style="s2">others but when it comes to knowing who</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.070" end="00:34:58.450" style="s2">they are and what they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.500" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">they&#39;re like they have no idea and one</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.450" end="00:35:03.070" style="s2">of the things about doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.900" style="s2">hierarchy is that there is better</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.070" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">preparation like one of the insights</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.900" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve had about</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:11.309" style="s2">modernism is it&#39;s it&#39;s not just a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:14.430" style="s2">meant oriented it&#39;s extremely humbling</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.309" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">you know anyone who&#39;s individuated or</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.430" end="00:35:21.460" style="s2">got to explore who they are and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">they can do in the world how many of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.460" end="00:35:27.910" style="s2">have achieved all of the potential that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:29.829" style="s2">you felt you had put up your hands if</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.910" end="00:35:32.589" style="s2">you&#39;ve achieved all of the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.829" end="00:35:34.839" style="s2">your individuation it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.589" end="00:35:37.180" style="s2">humbling it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.839" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not all world-class athletes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.180" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">not all the greatest musicians were not</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:44.050" style="s2">all going to become millionaires and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:46.990" style="s2">that humbling process of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.050" end="00:35:49.390" style="s2">really sets the stage for a true</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.990" end="00:35:51.369" style="s2">understanding of post-modernism where</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.390" end="00:35:53.859" style="s2">you get that everybody is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.369" end="00:35:57.309" style="s2">suffering and everybody&#39;s doing the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.859" end="00:35:58.780" style="s2">they can and that&#39;s a true embrace of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.309" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">other people the world you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.780" end="00:36:06.280" style="s2">humbled enough to not be believed you</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:08.140" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on and for people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.280" end="00:36:10.150" style="s2">haven&#39;t gone through that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.140" end="00:36:11.770" style="s2">part of why we get the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.150" end="00:36:14.980" style="s2">warriors because they&#39;re more at a</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.980" end="00:36:21.900" style="s2">thinking kind of thing and they go with</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.849" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">that more essential component into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.900" end="00:36:28.839" style="s2">postmodern rhetoric but they still parse</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.839" end="00:36:38.230" style="s2">really is I think they&#39;re like different</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">ways of handling different situations</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.230" end="00:36:45.369" style="s2">right if you get drawn into a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:48.970" style="s2">with somebody you&#39;re likely either gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.369" end="00:36:50.470" style="s2">go traditional rules and roles this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.970" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">how you should act or you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.470" end="00:36:55.150" style="s2">angry and try and intimidate them into</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">you know being a certain way and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.150" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re not in conflict you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:02.859" style="s2">of be in an intellectual position so we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:05.559" style="s2">kind of move up and down the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.859" end="00:37:10.089" style="s2">developmental stages depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.559" end="00:37:11.770" style="s2">development and some of us are well that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.089" end="00:37:13.930" style="s2">gets a little bit too complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.770" end="00:37:15.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very much more contextual than</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.930" end="00:37:17.950" style="s2">developmental but we kind of have to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.880" end="00:37:21.960" style="s2">all the stages anyway because they all</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.950" end="00:37:25.059" style="s2">have their place in different situations</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.960" end="00:37:27.970" style="s2">postmodern embrace of everything in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.059" end="00:37:31.180" style="s2">midst of really gross violence doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.970" end="00:37:33.460" style="s2">do that well sometimes you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.180" end="00:37:36.700" style="s2">know address somebody trying to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.460" end="00:37:39.240" style="s2">you with survival instincts not speech</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.700" end="00:37:40.890" style="s2">right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.240" end="00:37:42.780" style="s2">different sort of story and then and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.890" end="00:37:47.090" style="s2">maybe triggering people and I wish we</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.780" end="00:37:47.090" style="s2">could get into it but but but not so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.420" end="00:37:57.930" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to processing emotions so</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.290" end="00:38:02.930" style="s2">one of the things that I have come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.930" end="00:38:05.700" style="s2">appreciate is most of us don&#39;t achieve</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.930" end="00:38:08.790" style="s2">what we hope to achieve because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.700" end="00:38:12.780" style="s2">got something interfering with our</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.790" end="00:38:15.930" style="s2">actual izing ourselves so how many</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.780" end="00:38:18.990" style="s2">people here find themselves knowing they</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.930" end="00:38:26.369" style="s2">should do something but they for some</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.990" end="00:38:27.900" style="s2">reason don&#39;t do that okay now thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.369" end="00:38:30.360" style="s2">for being honest and thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.900" end="00:38:33.030" style="s2">putting up your hands the question is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.360" end="00:38:35.550" style="s2">what do you do about that now most</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.030" end="00:38:38.130" style="s2">people will try and rationally override</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.550" end="00:38:42.360" style="s2">and convince themselves and use</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.130" end="00:38:45.240" style="s2">willpower what I&#39;ve found is that most</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.360" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">of us have an emotional impression in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.240" end="00:38:52.950" style="s2">our system that we&#39;ve been carrying</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:57.420" style="s2">around for a while which gets stimulated</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.950" end="00:39:00.510" style="s2">into existence at the exact wrong times</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.420" end="00:39:02.910" style="s2">and interferes with us taking that step</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.510" end="00:39:05.010" style="s2">so let&#39;s suppose I&#39;m an entrepreneur and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.910" end="00:39:08.580" style="s2">I have this great product and I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.010" end="00:39:10.350" style="s2">all of this work and I&#39;ve done you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.580" end="00:39:12.300" style="s2">I can sit at home on the computer do all</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.350" end="00:39:15.390" style="s2">of this stuff and now it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.300" end="00:39:17.609" style="s2">point where I have to start phoning</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.390" end="00:39:20.100" style="s2">people and selling them on the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.609" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">I find I never quite get around to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.100" end="00:39:27.390" style="s2">phone call I can go see all the coaches</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">and get all the advice on how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.390" end="00:39:32.790" style="s2">how to set it up and how to do so many</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:36.210" style="s2">cold calls a day but what I find is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.790" end="00:39:37.980" style="s2">that person&#39;s being triggered by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.210" end="00:39:41.869" style="s2">phone call and they&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.980" end="00:39:45.420" style="s2">unconscious emotional fear you know of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.869" end="00:39:47.160" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen so let&#39;s suppose</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.420" end="00:39:50.820" style="s2">a person has a deep feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.160" end="00:39:52.200" style="s2">insignificance they find that every time</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.820" end="00:39:52.950" style="s2">they go to make a phone call they start</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.200" end="00:39:54.599" style="s2">thinking old</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.950" end="00:39:56.579" style="s2">person doesn&#39;t want to talk to me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.599" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">gonna interrupt that person they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.579" end="00:40:02.190" style="s2">important to want to talk to me right or</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:05.220" style="s2">maybe they got a feeling of helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.190" end="00:40:07.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s like oh it doesn&#39;t no matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.220" end="00:40:09.990" style="s2">what I do I&#39;m never gonna get people to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.290" end="00:40:11.640" style="s2">like you know go with this product and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.990" end="00:40:13.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s an unconscious thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.640" end="00:40:16.410" style="s2">they&#39;re not saying this out loud they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.740" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">feeling it and they collapse away from</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.410" end="00:40:21.060" style="s2">their goals and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:24.660" style="s2">entrepreneurialship because I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.060" end="00:40:26.730" style="s2">with entrepreneurs and it&#39;s amazing when</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.660" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">you do this work how suddenly you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.730" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">move through those barriers and and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:37.500" style="s2">think in many ways entrepreneurialship</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:41.300" style="s2">is an awesome spiritual practice because</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.500" end="00:40:44.310" style="s2">it forces you to face all of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.300" end="00:40:46.680" style="s2">unresolved issues because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.310" end="00:40:49.260" style="s2">many steps involved in becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.680" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">successful entrepreneur that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.260" end="00:40:53.730" style="s2">issues will be triggered at some point</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:54.270" style="s2">just like a good relationship will</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.730" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">trigger</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.270" end="00:40:58.980" style="s2">everybody&#39;s unresolved issues at some</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:02.069" style="s2">point that&#39;s why relationships are so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.980" end="00:41:04.710" style="s2">difficult they sensitize us so now I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.069" end="00:41:07.589" style="s2">been talking about impressions I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.710" end="00:41:10.430" style="s2">give you a phrase and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.589" end="00:41:13.109" style="s2">would consider like a pith teaching a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.430" end="00:41:15.569" style="s2">pith teaching means that it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.109" end="00:41:18.119" style="s2">the sutras or pith teachings the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.569" end="00:41:20.520" style="s2">you understand about the teachings and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.119" end="00:41:23.099" style="s2">you go back and read the same sutras the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.520" end="00:41:27.000" style="s2">more you&#39;ll get from those sutras or</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.099" end="00:41:31.010" style="s2">those teachings so here&#39;s a pissed</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.000" end="00:41:34.349" style="s2">teaching from the bio motive framework</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.010" end="00:41:38.750" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve gone to that window</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.349" end="00:41:43.849" style="s2">twice and it didn&#39;t come so any intense</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.750" end="00:41:47.240" style="s2">interpersonal encounter that&#39;s not fully</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.849" end="00:41:47.240" style="s2">experienced and expressed</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.540" end="00:41:53.480" style="s2">will become part of your sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.700" end="00:42:01.000" style="s2">or worldview instead of something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.480" end="00:42:01.000" style="s2">happened to you now</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.140" end="00:42:12.860" style="s2">take take a few seconds to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.180" end="00:42:15.830" style="s2">that any intense interpersonal encounter</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.860" end="00:42:19.190" style="s2">that isn&#39;t fully experienced and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.830" end="00:42:22.420" style="s2">expressed will become part of your sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.190" end="00:42:25.100" style="s2">of self or worldview</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.420" end="00:42:30.410" style="s2">instead of something that happened to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.100" end="00:42:33.170" style="s2">you so for example I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.410" end="00:42:36.910" style="s2">somebody who had OCD this is an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.170" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to show up as OCD and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.910" end="00:42:43.640" style="s2">she was working in an institution where</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:46.820" style="s2">perfectionism was reinforced doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.640" end="00:42:49.490" style="s2">things properly and rigorously and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.820" end="00:42:51.500" style="s2">her OCD was helpful but then it started</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.490" end="00:42:54.170" style="s2">getting in the way so she comes for</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.500" end="00:42:56.210" style="s2">therapy and we are going through her</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.170" end="00:42:58.190" style="s2">history trying to find the feelings that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.210" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">were going on between her you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.190" end="00:43:04.820" style="s2">underneath her need for perfection and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:09.560" style="s2">we came across a memory where she was in</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.820" end="00:43:12.290" style="s2">kindergarten and she had this half hour</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.560" end="00:43:14.270" style="s2">to draw a picture and she really loved</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.290" end="00:43:16.450" style="s2">her kindergarten teachers so she drew a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.270" end="00:43:19.970" style="s2">picture of the kindergarten teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.450" end="00:43:22.610" style="s2">her together and just put her whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.970" end="00:43:25.130" style="s2">heart into it and then at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.610" end="00:43:28.270" style="s2">half hour you know art period she went</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.130" end="00:43:31.130" style="s2">up to the teacher and just like meekly</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.270" end="00:43:33.470" style="s2">gave it to the teacher like with her</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.130" end="00:43:36.290" style="s2">whole heart like they trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.470" end="00:43:38.990" style="s2">this deep sense of connection and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.290" end="00:43:41.300" style="s2">teacher looked at it and she was busy</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.990" end="00:43:44.540" style="s2">she huh you can do better than that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.300" end="00:43:47.900" style="s2">and gave it back to her and it just</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.540" end="00:43:49.850" style="s2">devastated her you can do better than</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.900" end="00:43:52.600" style="s2">that meanwhile she put her entire heart</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.850" end="00:43:58.250" style="s2">into making this beautiful picture and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.600" end="00:44:04.550" style="s2">the impression was of inadequacy</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.250" end="00:44:07.070" style="s2">she felt in adequate and she didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.550" end="00:44:09.860" style="s2">home and cry about it where her parents</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.070" end="00:44:12.770" style="s2">could hold her and have her talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.860" end="00:44:14.840" style="s2">the experience and let her know that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.770" end="00:44:17.180" style="s2">was a beautiful picture and maybe say</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.840" end="00:44:19.430" style="s2">that the teacher was just busy but where</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.180" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">she&#39;d feel loved and accepted for where</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.430" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">she was she didn&#39;t do that she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:27.350" style="s2">fully experience and express it so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:33.850" style="s2">became part of her sense of self and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.350" end="00:44:37.550" style="s2">world view so that generalized into my</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.850" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">trying my best is not enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.550" end="00:44:43.850" style="s2">I am inadequate and even my best isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.790" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">good enough so if your best isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.850" end="00:44:48.740" style="s2">enough you do a hundred and ten percent</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">one hundred and twenty percent you you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.740" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">do it beyond your best she became</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:58.850" style="s2">perfectionistic once she found that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:01.250" style="s2">cried about it and talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.850" end="00:45:04.970" style="s2">devastating it was as a child to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.250" end="00:45:06.650" style="s2">guess what happened she lost a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.970" end="00:45:10.610" style="s2">of the energy that was driving her</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.650" end="00:45:13.370" style="s2">perfectionism and it took one or two</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.610" end="00:45:15.410" style="s2">other examples of those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.370" end="00:45:16.520" style="s2">because we tend to relive the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.410" end="00:45:19.070" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.520" end="00:45:21.380" style="s2">once we&#39;ve got an impression in but</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.070" end="00:45:26.810" style="s2">eventually she be sensually lost her OCD</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.380" end="00:45:30.940" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s an example now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.810" end="00:45:34.010" style="s2">become an event that happened to her</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.940" end="00:45:36.200" style="s2">okay now there&#39;s a book called unlocking</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.010" end="00:45:38.750" style="s2">the emotional brain that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.200" end="00:45:40.610" style="s2">discovered the same process from a dairy</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.750" end="00:45:43.160" style="s2">very different perspective I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.610" end="00:45:45.380" style="s2">doing this for 20 plus years and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.160" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">nice to have convergence and validity in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.380" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">some research saying that this is what</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:56.090" style="s2">people are doing to rewire the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:58.700" style="s2">system so impressions somebody asked me</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.090" end="00:46:02.030" style="s2">in group the other day who&#39;d done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.700" end="00:46:04.670" style="s2">of meditation when I think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.030" end="00:46:07.340" style="s2">clearing my emotional system it feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.670" end="00:46:10.270" style="s2">like a lifetime of work that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.340" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">believe it could ever just be clear and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.270" end="00:46:15.589" style="s2">the nice thing about</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">this work is that what I found with my</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.589" end="00:46:19.939" style="s2">nine core feelings is if they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:22.009" style="s2">nine of them literally over three years</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.939" end="00:46:23.989" style="s2">of clinical practice and me doing again</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.009" end="00:46:26.150" style="s2">lens focusing process and asking</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.989" end="00:46:28.130" style="s2">bringing people to tears over and over</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.150" end="00:46:29.749" style="s2">and asking what&#39;s the core of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.130" end="00:46:32.299" style="s2">feeling what&#39;s the the word that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.749" end="00:46:35.660" style="s2">vibrates with the deepest level of pain</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.299" end="00:46:38.119" style="s2">in you and they say this word after five</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.660" end="00:46:40.339" style="s2">six ten different words this is the word</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.119" end="00:46:43.189" style="s2">that deeply resonates I wrote the word</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.339" end="00:46:45.380" style="s2">down and you know a hundred clients</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.189" end="00:46:48.819" style="s2">later or two hundred whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.380" end="00:46:52.219" style="s2">over the three years I had nine words</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.819" end="00:46:54.549" style="s2">just astounding nine words at the core</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.219" end="00:46:57.229" style="s2">of all of our pain and suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.549" end="00:46:59.809" style="s2">that&#39;s why I believe that this is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.229" end="00:47:02.809" style="s2">the perceptual apparatus of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.809" end="00:47:07.160" style="s2">emotional brain for perceiving our</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.809" end="00:47:08.869" style="s2">relational status and so as a child</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.160" end="00:47:11.449" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably taken in core</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.869" end="00:47:13.819" style="s2">impressions that have affected how you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.449" end="00:47:16.099" style="s2">feel about yourself and your</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.819" end="00:47:18.829" style="s2">relationship to the world so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.099" end="00:47:22.849" style="s2">do an exercise now that I call the core</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.829" end="00:47:26.959" style="s2">feelings psychograph and what this is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.849" end="00:47:30.469" style="s2">an opportunity to just tune into your</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.959" end="00:47:33.679" style="s2">world I&#39;m gonna have you say a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.469" end="00:47:37.009" style="s2">out loud and then you&#39;re going to rank</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.679" end="00:47:40.069" style="s2">how much reverberation in your body you</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.009" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">get from it on a scale of zero to ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.069" end="00:47:44.660" style="s2">ten means you&#39;re almost in tears or</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:46.609" style="s2">you&#39;re crying or you would be crying if</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.660" end="00:47:49.929" style="s2">it was a better social situation to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.609" end="00:47:54.019" style="s2">that in zero means no resonance at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.929" end="00:47:58.099" style="s2">so this is a psychograph if the more</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.019" end="00:48:02.809" style="s2">open and vulnerable you can be okay the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.099" end="00:48:05.420" style="s2">more kind of signal there will be to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.809" end="00:48:07.279" style="s2">noise we&#39;ve got all sorts of repressive</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.420" end="00:48:10.849" style="s2">mechanisms that keep us from feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.279" end="00:48:12.469" style="s2">things so even if you&#39;ve got that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.849" end="00:48:15.140" style="s2">can get a sense even if they only go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.469" end="00:48:17.029" style="s2">four or five you&#39;ll see the relative</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.140" end="00:48:19.009" style="s2">weighting and that will give you an idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.029" end="00:48:23.359" style="s2">of where your issues are and how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.009" end="00:48:25.460" style="s2">might be distorting the world anyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.359" end="00:48:28.490" style="s2">have any questions about</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.460" end="00:48:33.849" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to do before we do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.490" end="00:48:37.420" style="s2">or any clarification probably better for</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.849" end="00:48:37.420" style="s2">what I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.120" end="00:48:49.130" style="s2">so the way I parse the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.510" end="00:48:53.800" style="s2">interpersonal feelings like rejected</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.130" end="00:48:56.810" style="s2">abused dismissed create core feelings</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.800" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">very people react very differently to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.810" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">being rejected</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:01.070" style="s2">some people feel worthless some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:04.850" style="s2">feel insignificant some people feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.070" end="00:49:09.610" style="s2">helpless etc then causes the emotion so</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.850" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple linear system</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.610" end="00:49:13.940" style="s2">feelings cause emotions interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.510" style="s2">feelings</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.940" end="00:49:19.190" style="s2">Express the dynamics between two people</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.510" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">core feelings are about how I feel about</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.190" end="00:49:25.910" style="s2">myself and my relational status to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:27.800" style="s2">world cause emotions this psychograph is</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.910" end="00:49:30.830" style="s2">going to get a sense of what&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.800" end="00:49:32.570" style="s2">in your system you can do this paper</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.830" end="00:49:34.610" style="s2">also in a situation if you&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.570" end="00:49:36.200" style="s2">fight with your spouse or something</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.610" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">happen at work or with a good friend</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:44.660" style="s2">situation find the feelings and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.620" end="00:49:46.190" style="s2">it&#39;ll bring you to tears and once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.660" end="00:49:50.120" style="s2">done that enough you&#39;ll find a pattern</p>

<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:51:01.770" style="s2">well and I&#39;m going to do something a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.310" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">little differently this time which is so</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.320" end="00:51:21.110" style="s2">this is a psycho graph of my life okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.790" end="00:51:23.790" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s not situational and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.110" end="00:51:28.190" style="s2">then just check out how you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.790" end="00:51:30.930" style="s2">right now just as an emotional being and</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.190" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">see how much sort of emotional energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.930" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">there is you know I don&#39;t have it set up</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:39.030" style="s2">for positive or negative but if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:40.770" style="s2">got any negative emotional energy just</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.030" end="00:51:43.710" style="s2">that you kind of live with on a day to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.770" end="00:51:50.210" style="s2">day basis just rate how big it feels in</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.710" end="00:51:53.220" style="s2">this context okay now I am then going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.210" end="00:51:57.560" style="s2">say have you repeat the words so two</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.220" end="00:52:04.440" style="s2">please don&#39;t go ahead okay of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.560" end="00:52:06.450" style="s2">or of me because I want to specifically</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.440" end="00:52:07.890" style="s2">give you a certain type of experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.450" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to do it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.890" end="00:52:14.010" style="s2">differently than the form so the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:21.630" style="s2">thing I want you to do is close your</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.010" end="00:52:25.650" style="s2">eyes take a few breaths and I want you</p>

<p begin="01:14:19.409" end="01:14:31.090" style="s2">Andrew I I&#39;m very aware of how exhausted</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.440" end="01:14:33.909" style="s2">I am like I&#39;m very and and just enough</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.090" end="01:14:36.489" style="s2">exhaustion to just even talk to like</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.909" end="01:14:41.530" style="s2">even talk to you right now but I feel</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.489" end="01:14:44.710" style="s2">that like just like I want to go take a</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.530" end="01:14:47.860" style="s2">nap what I&#39;ve done yet so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.710" end="01:14:49.900" style="s2">things going on one is because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.860" end="01:14:51.820" style="s2">closed their emotional systems down when</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.900" end="01:14:54.280" style="s2">we get the energy moving it&#39;s meeting a</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.820" end="01:14:56.590" style="s2">lot of friction so if you get activated</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.280" end="01:14:59.710" style="s2">to an eight but you&#39;re only expressive</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.590" end="01:15:03.099" style="s2">to you&#39;ve got six units of tension in</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.710" end="01:15:04.900" style="s2">your system that&#39;s one reason you get</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.099" end="01:15:07.050" style="s2">exhausted from doing this work and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.900" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">other is if we&#39;ve done this long enough</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.050" end="01:15:14.469" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned to close down to shut down</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:16.900" style="s2">this is like how depression works it you</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.469" end="01:15:18.940" style="s2">get activated you don&#39;t process it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.900" end="01:15:20.409" style="s2">too dangerous to stay activated because</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.940" end="01:15:24.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not going anywhere so you literally</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.409" end="01:15:27.400" style="s2">shut down and go to sleep until the</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.730" end="01:15:29.409" style="s2">activation passes but then you get up</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.400" end="01:15:32.230" style="s2">again and you get stimulated and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.409" end="01:15:35.349" style="s2">don&#39;t express it and your system has a</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.230" end="01:15:38.320" style="s2">shutoff valve right so you have to learn</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.349" end="01:15:40.780" style="s2">to unlearn that process and make it okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.320" end="01:15:44.020" style="s2">to have feelings and emotions but it</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.780" end="01:15:46.349" style="s2">makes sense that you&#39;ve been doing this</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.020" end="01:15:49.690" style="s2">because you haven&#39;t been given the tools</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.349" end="01:15:52.210" style="s2">for the aliveness that you do have you</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.690" end="01:15:55.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t shut your emotional systems down</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.210" end="01:16:00.820" style="s2">well enough like we did in the 60s you</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.750" end="01:16:03.130" style="s2">know and so you know now this is what I</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.820" end="01:16:06.579" style="s2">feel this or something like this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.130" end="01:16:09.580" style="s2">necessary to complete the postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.579" end="01:16:12.010" style="s2">move if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.580" end="01:16:14.670" style="s2">articulate your feelings and emotions at</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.010" end="01:16:17.380" style="s2">this level you&#39;ll never really</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.670" end="01:16:19.750" style="s2">understand and embrace feelings at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.380" end="01:16:22.090" style="s2">level you need to to have the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.750" end="01:16:26.550" style="s2">communication and relationship you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.090" end="01:16:26.550" style="s2">looking for with yourself and others</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.950" end="01:16:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s 431 I&#39;ll take one more comment if</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.970" end="01:16:42.430" style="s2">someone wants to share something and if</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.280" end="01:16:44.260" style="s2">not yeah Nathan so I found out about</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.430" end="01:16:46.420" style="s2">your framework from listening to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.260" end="01:16:50.170" style="s2">emerge podcast and this was quite</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.420" end="01:16:51.880" style="s2">recently but I wasn&#39;t I didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.170" end="01:16:54.250" style="s2">list of the nine core feelings so it was</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.880" end="01:16:56.260" style="s2">very interesting for me going through</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.250" end="01:17:00.160" style="s2">this exercise with you and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.260" end="01:17:02.500" style="s2">found sorry to back up one more I played</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.160" end="01:17:05.380" style="s2">around with this with myself seeing what</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.500" end="01:17:07.060" style="s2">kind of core feelings I found and I had</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.380" end="01:17:09.100" style="s2">named some feelings and I actually found</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.060" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">them here on this this list that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.100" end="01:17:17.590" style="s2">shared awesome what one other thing I</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:22.090" style="s2">was I really felt a strong emotional</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.590" end="01:17:25.780" style="s2">reaction to quite a lot of them and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.090" end="01:17:28.660" style="s2">just I&#39;m like I think like you know I</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.780" end="01:17:31.660" style="s2">like seven six or seven of them I&#39;m up</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.660" end="01:17:33.640" style="s2">around nine or ten I&#39;m like and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.660" end="01:17:35.680" style="s2">curious if they&#39;re but almost some of</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.640" end="01:17:40.870" style="s2">them kind of seem to live in the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.680" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">place like you know worthless hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.870" end="01:17:46.750" style="s2">and a bad person that all kind of drew</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:50.070" style="s2">me to like a course maybe a core feeling</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.750" end="01:17:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not to talk to your language but</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.070" end="01:17:57.040" style="s2">yeah when I was finding these core</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.880" end="01:17:59.370" style="s2">feelings I had hard time differentiating</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.040" end="01:18:01.270" style="s2">some of them like hopeless and helpless</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.370" end="01:18:03.850" style="s2">felt the same to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.270" end="01:18:08.410" style="s2">and eventually I realized hopeless was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.850" end="01:18:10.540" style="s2">temporal component of being stuck in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.410" end="01:18:13.030" style="s2">feeling and helpless was its own unique</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.540" end="01:18:15.250" style="s2">feeling that I could feel hopeless about</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.030" end="01:18:17.710" style="s2">my in significance or hopeless about my</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.250" end="01:18:19.540" style="s2">worthlessness but originally hopeless</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.710" end="01:18:21.490" style="s2">and helpless felt the same the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.540" end="01:18:24.220" style="s2">thing is developmentally</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.490" end="01:18:28.330" style="s2">were programmed to to fuse some of them</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.220" end="01:18:28.960" style="s2">so if I&#39;m feeling inadequate at a modern</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.330" end="01:18:33.520" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.960" end="01:18:37.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll also feel worthless because my</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.520" end="01:18:40.900" style="s2">value at modern is based on what I can</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.120" end="01:18:43.900" style="s2">do so if I can&#39;t do much then I am</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.900" end="01:18:46.420" style="s2">worthless it&#39;s not to postmodern that</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.900" end="01:18:49.090" style="s2">you get intrinsic worth and value for</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.420" end="01:18:50.890" style="s2">just being you so you can see how</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.090" end="01:18:54.010" style="s2">different developmental levels don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.890" end="01:18:56.320" style="s2">have this just these distinctions they</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.010" end="01:18:59.560" style="s2">literally are if you are inadequate or</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.320" end="01:19:01.840" style="s2">helpless you are worthless and so we</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.560" end="01:19:05.650" style="s2">have to like work to extract those out</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.840" end="01:19:08.500" style="s2">in this new modern postmodern world so</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.650" end="01:19:10.450" style="s2">I&#39;m actually supposed to be golfing in</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.500" end="01:19:12.340" style="s2">in an hour and a bit and I&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.450" end="01:19:13.570" style="s2">hour and a bit of a drive so this has</p>
