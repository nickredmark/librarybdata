 The Psychological Significance of "Bible" Story Seventh Lecture: Walking with God——Noah and the Ark by Jordan B. Peterson
 thank you all
 I took a look today
 This series of lectures has now been broadcasted over 1 million online
 Pretty amazing
 Or they are only viewed 1 million times
 This is also possible
 Okay, let's go directly to the topic
 I think last week
 There is too little content related to the Bible
 Let me summarize what was laid out last time
 Set up a frame for tonight’s discussion
 I basically describe this picture in detail for everyone
 It took me a long time to imagine
 About 25 years ago
 This may be why this picture looks so primitive
 Seriously, I put my 486 computer
 Run to the limit to make this picture
 This picture is
 A manifestation of the life prototype situation
 These prototype situations
 It's true no matter when and where
 So you can think of them as
 Description of the essential characteristics of human experience
 This is not the same as reality
 Because you can divide reality into subjective and objective elements
 This is effective
 But these manifestations will not be so distinguished
 They believe that human experience is an integral part of reality
 We also experienced this
 So we just follow this
 This basically means
 We always exist in an incomplete structure
 Part of this structure is biological
 Partly social and cultural
 Part of it was passed on to us by our ancestors
 As far as the underlying architecture is concerned, the same is true from the practicality
 Psychologically
 This is also true for the content we learn autonomously
 Including, for example, our ability to use language
 Words and sentences used
 Also formed through communication and interaction
 Mutual understanding
 In terms of prototype, this system is always old and corrupt
 It's dead because
 It is constructed by the dead
 It is rotten because
 Things will always fall apart spontaneously
 And the fact that people don’t establish goals and directions
 Accelerated the process of degeneration
 I think you need to pay attention to some things
 People always stand aside
 Wait to see when these problems disappear by themselves
 I mean to say
 Young people always have many reasons for the status quo of things
 Feel cynical
 Always be like this
 I think in this view
 Concepts such as patriarchal society are very useful
 The social structure is corrupt and incomplete
 Is a prototype fact
 this means
 To some extent your whole life
 Have to deal with it
 This is a constant fact of existence itself
 So the incomplete social structure we live in
 Or even biological structure
 Feel angry and frustrated
 I feel all this is for myself
 But the worst
 I feel all this is against myself
 Is a misunderstanding of human existence
 Because of what you are given and where you live
 Is degraded and corrupt and needs to be corrected
 Always like this
 This fact is not difficult to accept
 Because it also has positive factors
 That is
 At least you were given something
 Instead of nothing
 And didn't give you pure hell
 Because especially in our western culture
 Many things are working well
 There are many things to be grateful for
 Even a broken machine
 Not completely hopeless
 It didn't want to
 every moment
 All make you trapped in pain and destruction
 It can easily become like that
 Because many societies are like that
 We have not lived in a
 A society that is so corrupted beyond imagination
 This fact is very grateful
 So we all live in a broken structure
 We are also responsible for its incompleteness because
 We haven’t been doing our best to fix it
 You might say this is a basic
 People always ask what is the meaning of life
 What they really want to ask is what is the positive meaning of life
 Because like we said
 The negative meaning of life is somewhat self-evident
 However, the positive meaning is in
 Realize that the siege you live in needs to be repaired
 Then ran to do something
 For example, fill in the gap and repair the wall
 The structure you live in
 Be as safe and productive as possible
 You do not lack the opportunity to do so
 You can do it in your heart
 You can do this in your room
 You can do this in your family
 You can do this in your community
 If you do this thing well on these levels
 You can set the goal higher
 There will always be challenges
 what is interesting is
 Inside this incomplete structure
 Always embedded with a series of challenges
 Because of its incompleteness
 Maybe even because of its rotten nature
 It is calling you to a heroic adventure
 Potential answer
 To take a heroic adventure is to fix the roadblock
 Repair the city
 You can always do
 No matter what kind of environment you are in
 There will always be some around you
 Something wrong
 Things that have not been properly arranged
 You can fix things if you want
 We are going to talk tonight
 One of the things is
 If you take that attitude
 What you should do is make the world a better place
 No matter where you are no matter what you do
 In fact, after you did
 The world will get better
 Wherever you are in various forms
 We as a race
 More or as a different individual
 Rarely realize this
 It will not be used as a proposition often
 This surprised me
 I experienced an interesting thing one day
 I went to eat at the Keg steakhouse
 Because I am allergic to many foods
 This restaurant treats people with food allergies very carefully
 The waiter took me to my seat
 He said he has been watching my lecture
 I often hear this
 He is very happy about it
 He said he had been in the past two months
 I have been promoted twice in this restaurant
 Because he watched my lecture
 I really think his experience is very moving
 You might say he is just a waiter
 There is nothing special about bravery
 I disagree
 Because i don't care where you are
 You can do your work to the extreme
 I really mean this
 You can accept a job
 Then turn it into a complete nightmare
 Or you can act like a civilized human
 And realized that no matter where you are
 There is a variety of variety on hand
 Unfinished things
 And you will take it seriously
 you can say
 "I just happened to be a waiter in this restaurant"
 "This is not the job I expected."
 He is a young man
 "Maybe this is not where I belong."
 "But it's not useless, it's a rich environment"
 "I can make it much better if I want."
 "I can get along well with my colleagues"
 "Don't just talk about them behind their backs"
 "I can treat my customers well"
 "If there is a chance to show up in front of me, I will seize it"
 "I can pay attention to what is happening around me"
 That guy said he did that
 Things got better
 He has a higher position than three months ago
 How long is three months
 This is a good track
 Is going uphill
 This is what you really want
 I think an uphill road is better than
 Better to be in a good situation
 Because it can really make your life meaningful
 You know soberly that you are moving towards a place
 That place is better than where you are now
 If you understand
 What you are doing and your tendency to do it
 It would be better if there is direct causality
 I have received many letters like this
 Most of them are written to me by young men, although not all
 They said "I have been listening to your lessons"
 "I made up my mind to try to take the responsibility of life."
 "I stopped doing those stupid things
 "Those stupid things I know I shouldn't do"
 "I started doing those
 "Not stupid, I know what I should do"
 Actually it's pretty obvious whether you should do it
 If you think about it
 But even if they are obvious
 People don’t do these things
 Then they wrote to me saying
 "You can't believe how much change this has brought me."
 They are very excited about it
 I was also very excited when I received such a letter
 I really don’t compare to receiving such a letter
 Better experience
 Because seeing the less good things replaced by better things
 This is really great
 I think this is an inconclusive question
 I really believe this is an inconclusive question
 "If we are determined to do something
 "How far can we make them better?"
 Some of the stories we discussed
 Especially the story of Cain and Abel
 Is the analysis of this problem
 This is a compelling analysis
 It appears so early in these texts
 Such a basic story
 It basically says
 There are two modes of behavior in the world
 One is that you take it rightly
 The responsibility to live
 And then make the necessary sacrifices
 So everything can flourish
 The other is the path of hatred
 Painful renunciation, killing and extinction
 It seems to me exactly like this
 So if the positive way is beckoning you if you can notice it
 If you can really lower your head and humbly notice it
 Carl Jung once said
 "Modern people cannot see God
 "Because they refuse to condescend to look at it."
 That's a sentence I like very much
 People look down on
 The opportunity that appeared before them
 It doesn't make sense
 It is the majesty of being that appears before you
 This is what appeared in front of you
 It is endlessly complex and full of potential
 You have no reason to assume where you are now
 As a starting point
 I know some people have terrible lives
 Their situation is completely beyond the tolerance of ordinary people
 But i also know
 Even in that situation
 Can be made worse by your worst attitude
 I am very sure of that
 So anyway you are in that situation
 You are in a damaged structure
 You yourself are a damaged structure
 You are in a damaged structure
 But it still has a few walls
 You are not fed to lions every day as food
 This is a good thing
 You can rush out like a hero and magically
 To face those
 The chaos that constantly endangers your structure
 You can free something by doing this
 You can learn something to make yourself stronger
 This is another aspect
 Because it affects your composition
 It’s what you encounter when you voluntarily face the unknown
 The more you voluntarily face the unknown
 The more you will grow
 The more you grow, the more things you can meet
 You are more and more able to face the unknown
 Then re-establish order
 From the potential of being
 Summon the right order
 Gosh, do you have to think about it
 Why don't you do this
 Even if you can do it
 This is an endless mystery
 To a certain extent, this truth is also covered in
 In the story of Adam and Eve
 Adam became self-aware and self-aware
 And feel ashamed of myself
 He considers himself a lowly creature
 People will think so for countless reasons
 Because we are full of defects
 So Adam avoided God
 I think this is the answer to this puzzle
 People do not aim for the highest good
 Because they are ashamed of themselves
 Their weaknesses and shortcomings
 This is not the only reason
 There is also a desire to avoid responsibility
 And also all those negative motives
 Like resentment and hatred
 And the expectation of making things worse
 I don’t want everyone to think about the relaxed side
 Almost like this
 So it’s okay if you are in a not so good place
 If all you want to do is put where you are
 become better
 As a clinical psychologist I know one thing
 It’s just that you can’t believe how powerful a bit of progress can be
 You can do a calculation like a cumulative interest rate
 If you can make your life a tenth better every week
 In two or three years
 You can get to a much better place than you are now
 Reminiscence
 If you insist on ten or twenty years
 Especially if you are still young
 You start cheering up earlier
 Then start to solve the problems you can solve
 You can transform your life incredibly
 In terms of human possibilities
 God knows what its upper limit is
 We are magical creatures
 When we really cheer up
 And no longer just run at our 10% capacity
 So you should do
 Things are not what they should be
 This thing at least gives you something to do
 Maybe still something great
 Because the suffering and troubles are endless
 They haunt the world
 So you can improve the world
 The utility of this and its own meaning are self-evident
 This also makes me
 Curious about things like nihilism and despair
 I understand these emotions
 I understand them deeply
 And the mentality of intellectuals accompanying it
 But they are off the point to some extent
 Because there are so many things to do
 You just need to open your eyes
 Look at them and decide
 What will you really do
 You might think
 Things i can influence
 Too trivial, no need to do it
 But if you do it, it won’t always be trivial
 Not at all
 Besides, I didn’t think it was trivial at first
 I don’t think any one thing is trivial
 My life experience tells me
 Everything I did pays off
 It doesn’t have to be returned to me in the way I expected
 This is totally different
 But if you really make up your mind to do something
 Even if it goes off
 Its result is not what I expected
 But the overall result will be good in the long run
 All conquerable new areas are a step forward
 New fields will never be exhausted
 We are surrounded by the unknown
 We are surrounded by our own ignorance
 We can choose to continuously advance to the chaotic realm
 Or we can reshape these pathological orders
 This is the secret of legitimate being
 So when you face chaos
 You can think of yourself as a
 Individuals who have the ability to overcome chaos despite their defects
 Not to mention the danger of doing this is another matter
 Because of the fact that you are fragile
 Is the premise of your heroism
 Because if you are not vulnerable
 Then do a difficult thing itself
 There is no bravery, is it?
 If you can't be hurt or knocked down
 Or end in failure
 So where are these hardworking warriors?
 That fragility must be deeply rooted in courage
 Not a reason to escape
 In fact the opposite
 So what should you do
 You integrate and revitalize the city
 Maybe change back to what you want
 So that it becomes practical, efficient and beautiful
 People can open branches there
 It makes people feel
 The unbearable disaster of existence itself
 Becomes worth experiencing
 That's what you should be determined to do
 It's not impossible
 Then you didn’t just repair the city
 You turned yourself into a
 Repairman who keeps repairing the city
 That's even better, that's your ultimate goal
 Your goal is not only to repair the city
 Still have to turn yourself into a
 A repairman who can keep repairing the city
 There is no reason why this kind of thing shouldn't happen
 The more such things happen, the better
 There is a dark line in the story of the flood
 Is the fact that the city has become corrupt
 Because people don’t make heroic efforts
 Or they did the opposite endeavor
 Committed a completely destructive behavior
 This is another thing worth thinking about
 If you think about your own life
 You can say to people
 "You have to tell the truth and be a good person"
 This is obviously a cliché
 Also because it's a cliché
 So not convincing
 But you can take it apart to see
 Practice this sentence in a less old-fashioned way
 For example, you can look at this sentence more modestly
 Maybe you can't tell the truth because
 You don't know what the truth is
 But there is one thing you can do
 You can stop telling lies that you know
 You might say how do I know which words are false
 To answer this question requires a philosophy of truth
 Have a long talk
 Let’s not delve into this question
 Because in a sense this is not the point we are going to talk about now
 The problem is that there are always times in your life
 You know what you are saying is not true
 It’s a lie
 You use it to manipulate yourself
 Or manipulate others or the world
 And you still think that you can retreat without being held accountable
 This is demonic arrogance
 In fact, this arrogant prototype is shown in
 In the mythical image of the devil Satan
 Satan is the ones who think they can
 People who distort the structure of reality without paying the price
 Prototype thought element
 You can't think of anything more arrogant than this
 You really think you can distort the facts
 Then this will bring you benefits
 Won't you receive any retribution?
 Everyone knows it won't work
 Back to the topic at the beginning
 you know
 According to the rules of the game you are playing
 sometimes
 You are violating those rules of the game
 The first thing we are talking about is
 Tell the truth or take responsibility
 They just mean
 Don't cheat in the game of your choice
 This is a good starting point
 Then you will start to sort out your life
 So how does the flood relate to this
 We live in a corrupt structure
 We are corrupt as independent individuals
 We live in a corrupt structure
 Part of the spoilage is just accident
 Things just fall apart like this
 But another part of the corruption is because
 Our goals are often not positive but negative
 The flood story is a very clear warning
 The warning is if your goal is negative enough
 Then there are enough people like this
 Everything will go backwards
 Like the chaos at the beginning of time
 Probably like this
 The appearance of the universe in mythology is chaos versus order
 It can be said that order is above and chaos always hides below
 Chaos can burst and order can collapse
 And you can plunge into chaos
 Chaos is a mixed potential
 The way to disrupt order and make chaos rise
 As depicted in the flood story
 Was parasitic on your father's body
 This is a mythical theme
 And cannibalized his body without gratitude
 Never thought of compensating for what I have been asking for
 The warning in the flood story is not to do this for long
 Because things will get so bad you can't imagine
 That will happen to you
 Will happen in your family
 Also happen in your social group
 This kind of thing happened to people time and time again in history
 It's kind of interesting
 After the story of Cain and Abel is over
 In the story of Adam and Eve, evil soon came to the world
 And accompanied by the awakening of self-awareness
 Evil is the knowledge of good and evil in this story
 Is the ability to hurt others
 Have a clear understanding of what you are doing
 Of course Cain immediately took this to the extreme
 He destroyed his beloved with that ability
 He did his best to destroy the divine ideal
 His younger brother named Abel is favored by God
 Cain destroyed him
 At the end of that chapter Cain said to God
 The punishment he received was beyond his capacity
 I think the reason is
 Once you destroy your ideals, where will you be
 What are you left
 You can't go where there is no room for improvement
 When there is no room for improvement, there will be a lot of fall
 Milton in "Paradise Lost"
 When describing the nature of hell from a psychological perspective
 Came up with a very good idea
 Your depth in hell is your distance from the "good"
 This way of understanding is also very good
 If you destroy your own ideals
 With jealousy and resentment
 With the desire to defeat the person you want to be
 You will fall into a situation no different from hell
 The story of the Bible is unfolded by Cain
 Then the flood
 Cain adopted a way of being that is opposed to being itself
 At least as opposed to being positive
 He did it voluntarily
 Fully aware of what you are doing
 When this way of being affects the entire social structure
 The end result is
 God stepped back and said
 "The whole thing got so bad
 "All we can do is destroy this."
 This is not a joke, this is how things are
 In this series of stories
 There is a very scary thing
 And I believe in its authenticity
 I am independent of my analysis of myths
 Aware of this
 I checked China under Mao Zedong in the Soviet Union
 And what happened in places like Nazi Germany
 Those who have the most keen insight into these societies
 How those absolute disasters happened
 Those who are most interested
 All said the same thing
 It is rooted in the degeneration of the individuals that make up this society
 You hear them say "people just obey orders"
 No, this explanation is simply not tenable
 "If people resist, they will be punished."
 This is a bit true
 But not as good as people might think
 Especially at the beginning of the process
 It's more people's decision
 Each of them
 Turn a blind eye to disasters and participate in lies
 This distorts the whole society
 They turned towards
 The closest place you can think of to hell
 Especially in Nazi Germany
 Including the above three places
 Like the Chinese Soviet Union in the Mao era
 The scary thing in "Genesis" is
 They speak very clearly
 Your moral degradation will largely lead to
 Degeneration of the entire universe
 You would say i want my life to be meaningful
 People say that, but is that true?
 Do you really want to make your life meaningful
 You think people will use a bit of nihilism
 To escape that special realization
 I think people have always done this
 Recognize that it is too heavy
 But we are connected
 This is the weakness caused by our strong communication skills
 Of course the chain reaction of our personal behavior
 May be far beyond the limits of our current consciousness
 I think people know this too
 They are a kind of "I know
 "But I don’t want to realize that I know."
 In other words, people know their specific manifestations
 People can feel them
 People have emotional reactions to these things
 But refused to make them clear
 Because they don't want to know
 When you do or haven’t done things to yourself
 When feeling guilty and ashamed
 I know this can become uncontrollable
 This is usually because you have a small distorted self
 Want the worst result
 One thing Jung said about shadows is
 That’s Jung’s famous theory that everyone has a dark side
 And the dark side needs to be integrated and aware
 The dark side of humanity will spread all the way to hell
 This is the interesting thing about reading Jung's works
 He said exactly what he meant
 This is not a metaphor
 Partly twisted to oppose beings
 Is consistent with part of the conscious universe
 Your goal is to make everything as bad as possible
 Realizing this can be very shocking
 This is part of the reason why people don’t want to realize it
 People will keep a certain distance from it
 It’s like admitting to be a guard of a Nazi concentration camp
 This exercise is very useful
 It's entirely possible that you used to be such a guard
 And most likely you are still
 If you don't think so
 Then there is more reason to assume
 You are powerless to resist when temptation really comes to you
 If you don’t think guarding this position is a temptation
 Then you really don't understand human nature
 You didn't even touch the door
 If this is not a temptation
 There won't be so many people doing this
 And many people have done this, nothing new
 The seriousness of the story of "Genesis" develops very, very fast
 Serious depth is the ultimate prototype
 How serious you can be
 The story of Noah and the Flood unfolds in a fragmented way
 I believe these clips are part of a longer story
 And we only have fragments of this long story
 And this long story is also part of other stories
 This is how the story begins
 "When there are more people in the world,
 "When the daughter was born again" (Genesis 6:1)
 "The sons of God see the beauty of human women
 "Just choose and marry as your wife" (Genesis 6:2)
 There are two ways of looking at the past
 You can see this in our political environment
 On the more conservative end of the political spectrum
 People think the past is the place of great people
 Heroes of the past
 Created our current environment
 The left may be more concerned about
 Corruption that has lasted for centuries
 Both views are correct
 You can say that there were many great heroes in the past
 They established our model of being
 You can imagine the two as compound creatures if you want
 This is a very reasonable way of thinking
 You can also think about the centuries
 The accumulation of corruption and evil
 Both views are reflected in these lines of Scripture
 "The sons of God (the heroes)
 "Women who see people are beautiful
 "Just choose and marry as your wife" (Genesis 6:2)
 Then this statement is a bit illogical
 "The Lord says
 "Man is natural
 "My spirit will not live in him forever
 "However, his life can reach one hundred and twenty years" (Gen 6:3)
 I studied various interpretations of this section
 Because it doesn’t seem to be clearly connected to the previous section
 Its exact meaning is not obvious
 The first line is about the heroes of the past
 The second line means slow
 The way of human existence is corrupt
 As far as God is concerned, one of the consequences of this situation is
 In some cases
 The divine spirit will not fight against humans
 This means that in some cases
 Let me put it this way I think there is no better explanation than this
 This means the divine impulse for good
 Will leave you because of what you have done
 The second thing to consider is
 Maybe due to human degradation
 The limited life span is not obvious
 Our spirit only exists for a limited time
 It in a strange way
 Intertwined with human moral guilt
 This is contrary to the concept of great men in the past
 Then the story goes back to the point of view of the great man
 "At that time there were great men on the ground
 "Later the sons of God
 "Women who have sex with men have children
 "That is the famous person of ancient heroism" (Genesis 6:4)
 This is the end of the sequence fragment is very fragmented
 But you can see that there are two narratives behind this
 One of them is like this
 Corruption is always lurking
 Even the nature of the great men of the past is the same
 This led to God’s refusal to show grace and the fall of mankind
 Pave the way for the story of Noah and the flood
 "Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth
 "Everything you think about all day is evil" (Genesis 6:5)
 When I was a child, I really didn't like going to church
 I went to a very gentle church
 It is a united church
 It’s not even a church now
 It can be said to be too mild
 One of the reasons I don’t like
 The pastor was chattering about the sinful nature of man
 I don't think it's right
 Partly because i don't understand the meaning
 Partly because of its self-flagellation
 Seems unattractive
 I don’t know if there are any ways to make self-flagellation attractive
 There are some mechanical and fake things that I don’t like
 I did more thinking in the following years
 I started to understand
 Let people take the evil
 Clearly and consciously
 Putting it at the forefront of imagination has practical meaning
 I think I mentioned it to you last week
 A short section of Mesopotamian culture
 It’s about the emperor and the traditions of the New Year holiday
 People would take the emperor out of the city wall and strip off his dragon suit
 Make him an ordinary person
 Then people will humiliate him in the ceremony
 Questioned him what happened in the past year
 Why haven't you become the majestic incarnation of Marduk
 Marduk is the god of Mesopotamia
 He created order from chaos
 The emperor should sit down and think
 "Well, I am an emperor, I should behave well."
 "You have to perform well."
 "But it's likely that I lack in many aspects
 "The missing part happens to be very important
 "Because I'm starring in this whole ceremony."
 "I should be very, very clear
 "How did I fail my ideals"
 I want to say that in institutionalized Christianity
 This is a horn that is constantly degrading
 That’s actually the Christian view
 There are thousands of ways
 Stop you from being everything you want to be
 It shouldn't be a whip to knock you down
 Although it might have whipped your pride
 The pride that prevents you from seeing your shortcomings
 It's more like a horn to the opposite side
 It's like saying it's enough to stop
 You can do better than now
 It will be of great benefit to you and to others
 But it won’t be good if you continue to break your own rules
 Because as I said
 If you start playing this game
 You should at least follow the rules of the game
 If you observe yourself
 It's a little scary
 But if you pay attention
 I will find myself lying
 I was in my 20s when I first realized this
 I am a smart person and I was very proud of it
 I was also a small man back then
 The seat was adjusted forward when going to school
 I was not tall when I enrolled
 So I am very short in the class
 I am also very talkative
 At this point, everyone may be surprised
 I'm still a bit provocative
 So I am often bullied
 After all, no one is immune
 My weapon is to talk
 This is a very effective weapon although it can backfire
 Because you know
 If you talk so much to a rough big man
 They will probably start heavy manual roughing
 That kind of thing often happens to me
 But I am very proud that I have some intellectual advantages
 At that time when I was in my 20s
 I started to realize the danger
 I started reading "Paradise Lost" by Milton
 And began to understand the dangers of intelligence
 In my opinion, the danger of intelligence lies in
 It can easily lead to arrogance and arrogance
 It’s easy to be obsessed with your own creations
 In fact that is Lucifer
 In "Paradise Lost" that is Lucifer
 Lucifer is brilliant
 He is obsessed with his creation
 I think there is nothing outside of my thinking
 This is a totalitarian mentality, isn't it
 "We have an overall system
 "Know how everything works"
 "We will implement
 "So paradise on earth is realized"
 This is a totalitarian mentality
 Related to intellectual arrogance
 Then another thing happened
 I noticed this problem myself
 And start to understand what that means
 I also started to understand
 There are other things in life besides intelligence
 Too much
 I was crazy about smoking and drinking
 The weight is almost 60 kg
 My body is not that good
 I had a lot of things to do when I was a graduate student
 Come to cheer yourself up
 At the same time I tried to figure it out
 Why is the world wrong like this
 This can be seen in the epitome of the Cold War
 And what role will i play in it
 If there is any role
 What role will each of us play in it
 I didn’t work long in a prison at that time
 I work with a crazy psychologist
 He often adds jokes to multiple choice tests
 He is a very weird guy
 But i like his class very much
 He taught a course on "creativity"
 Also a prison psychologist
 He is a weird guy
 I don't know why he favors me
 Maybe it's because I'm also weird
 He invited me many times
 Go with him to the highest security prison in Edmonton
 I went
 It was a very interesting experience
 Because i want to figure it out
 Individual behavior for the group
 What is the role of the abnormal state
 Reasons like this
 I went and met a little guy shorter than me
 I grew taller then
 He is a pretty harmless guy
 Then I came to the gym
 The prison looks like a high school
 It looks really like to me
 There are all heavy lifting guys
 Everyone is wicked
 I remember someone with tattoos all over
 There is a huge scar in the middle of the chest
 Looks like someone was injured with an axe
 I stood there in the weird cloak that I often wear
 I bought it in Portugal and paired it with boots
 Like the cloak of Sherlock Holmes in the 1890s
 It really looks like the clothing of the 1890s
 Because the small village is on the mountain
 Surrounded by city wall villagers selling these things
 I think they haven’t changed the style since the end of the 19th century
 So i think it's pretty cool
 I just wore it like this
 This may not be the most conservative dress
 If you are going to the highest security prison
 I'm in the gym anyway
 The psychologist left
 God knows what's going on, he's such a weird person
 Everyone gathered around
 They want to exchange my prison clothes for my cloak
 I can hardly refuse this request
 I really don't know what to do
 Then this little guy spoke
 He said the psychologist asked me to take you away
 Similar words
 I just thought "Okay
 "This little guy is better than those big guys."
 We walked out of the gym
 Go through a few "school gates" to the playground
 We wandered around and he started chatting with me
 He looks like a harmless guy
 Then the psychologist appeared at the door
 Motion us to go back
 It's a relief
 I walked into his office
 He said, "Do you know the man who walked with you on the playground?"
 I said yes"
 He said, "One night, that man kidnapped two policemen."
 "Let them kneel down"
 "The two beg him to make a living."
 "He shot the back of the two heads."
 I thought "good guy"
 You see, the interesting thing about this is
 He looks pretty harmless, right
 You think someone like him would do this kind of thing
 Let's put it this way, it must be completely different from you
 Certainly not a harmless looking guy
 Do you think that person would be
 Half-werewolf and half-vampire look
 Then you immediately know that he is a cold-blooded killer
 but not
 He is such an insignificant little person
 But if you give him a revolver
 Of course he is not so harmless
 I thought a lot about this
 What is the relationship between harmless and dangerous
 Then something happened
 I met another person there
 In a week or two
 I heard he and his friend caught the other guy
 Smashed the man's left leg with a lead pipe
 Just like that
 They did it because they thought that man was an informer
 Maybe he really is
 My reaction was different that time
 I was not just shocked or frightened
 Although I was really scared
 What I think is how can you do it
 Because I don't think I can do it
 I think myself and those people
 There are essential differences
 So I spent two weeks trying to figure out
 Under what conditions would i do this
 What kind of psychological change do I experience
 To do that
 It can be said that it is a kind of meditation training
 After only ten days I found out
 I can not only do
 And it's much easier than I expected
 I've been here since
 And the wall between the "shadow" described by Jung
 Began to fall apart
 That's also useful
 Because I started to treat myself as a different individual
 Because I didn’t realize it before
 I thought I was a good person
 Naturally, there is no reason to think badly about yourself
 Unless you really do your best to be a good person
 Otherwise you are not a good person
 Really not being a good person is never easy
 So you might just be a less bad person
 Far from being a terrible person
 Far from being a good person
 But after that I have a little more respect for myself
 Because i also understand
 There are some terrible elements in the human mind
 You have to respect this
 That's a part of yourself
 To some extent you have to see yourself as a loaded weapon
 When getting along with children
 It's very useful to see yourself as a loaded weapon
 Because you are a loaded weapon in front of the child
 Many children have terrible experiences when they are with their parents
 Can confirm this
 Anyway, I started to change a bit since then
 I really don't know the causality of these things
 I guess it’s because I was trying to figure out
 Who am i and how to fix this like these
 I started paying very close attention to what I said
 I don't know if this happened intentionally or unintentionally
 But I can feel my heart "split"
 Some students told me
 They have encountered the same thing
 It happened after they heard some of my course materials
 I have talked about the information
 I split into two so you can say
 One is the old one I keep talking
 Like arguing like all kinds of ideas
 The other part is watching
 I just opened my eyes and looked at it neutrally
 The me who looked at me neutrally
 Observing the me who speaks
 Seems to be saying "that's not your idea"
 "You don't really believe it"
 "You don't understand what you are talking about"
 "that is not true"
 I thought to myself, "Hoh, that's so funny"
 I think so 95% of the time when I speak
 Then I really don't know what to do
 I thought to myself "Okay, this is weird"
 Maybe I split it's not a good thing at all
 It’s not that I have auditory hallucinations or something
 Not like that
 Put it this way, people have many faces
 So I encountered this strange puzzle
 Which of the two is me
 It’s the one who always listens and speaks
 "It's rubbish, it's a lie"
 "You did that to get people's attention."
 "You just want to win the debate"
 Is that me
 Or it’s me who talks normally
 I don't know but i decided i want to be the critic
 Then I tried my best to do
 Or learn to do
 Stop saying those things that make me look vulnerable
 I mean I'm still trying to do this
 Because I always feel
 No matter what I say when I speak
 Those words are either helping me find my position
 Or it's breaking me up
 I do think "calibration"
 Is a suitable concept to express it
 Because if you express something as honestly as possible
 Then they are produced from deep in your heart
 We don't know where the ideas come from
 We don't know
 The idea is to emerge from how deep in your underlying structure
 We don’t know what kind of physical calibration you have to go through
 To speak from the heart
 We don't understand at all
 We can't even conceptualize it
 But i believe you can feel
 I learned something from Carl Rogers
 He is an amazing clinician
 He thinks mental health
 Partly spiritual or abstract
 And the body are aligned with each other
 In psychoanalysis and clinical thinking
 There are many thoughts about calibration
 But anyway I decided to start practicing
 Don't say the things that make me look weak
 The result is
 I can't say almost everything I have said
 95%, right?
 That was a huge blow
 It takes months to wake up
 Then realized that you were almost a piece of deadwood
 This is a heavy hammer
 You might think
 "Well, do you really want to burn all the deadwood?"
 "Well, there is only a little empty shell left."
 "Only 5% of you are left."
 If that 5% is solid
 Then maybe this is exactly what you want
 So I said this story is the interpretation of the following verses
 "Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth
 "Everything you think about all day long is evil" (Gen 6:5)
 This is a question worth asking
 "What is your motive?"
 Maybe their motives are purer than mine
 It is certainly possible
 I don't think I was born a particularly good person
 I think I have to work very, very hard to do it
 I don't think everyone is like that
 But some people are worse than that
 In a way everyone is so bad
 So it's worth thinking about
 "How much trouble did you try to cause?"
 There is one more thing you can think about
 If you are not using your life to do something important
 In terms of your own definition
 Because that's the game we are participating in
 You have to define these terms at least from the beginning
 Maybe you get into trouble
 But because you didn’t have better things to do
 Trouble is more fun than boring
 If you read Dostoyevsky, you will understand
 Dostoevsky understood this very well
 So if you don’t push yourself to the limit
 Then you have countless excess will energy and resources
 Used to create interesting disasters
 I also think this is the prototype scene of this passage
 "Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth
 "Everything you think about all day long is evil" (Genesis 6:5)
 It's worth thinking about here
 That's not self-destructive
 Because it's like a diagnosis of a disease
 It's like if you are really like that to some extent
 May only account for 10% of you may account for 90%
 It would be great to be aware of this
 Because you may not do it anymore
 why not
 You obviously have to abandon all your anger and hate these emotions
 That's really annoying
 Because these emotions are easy to fall into
 They are addictive
 With a sense of self-righteousness
 But you are not doing this to hurt yourself
 You are doing this
 Leave behind what you don't need
 "Jehovah regretted making man on earth
 "Sorrow in the heart" (Gen 6:6)
 "The Lord says
 "'I will create
 "『With animals and insects
 "『And all the birds in the sky are wiped out from the ground
 ""I regret it because I made them"" (Genesis 6:7)
 What is the main point of this
 The theme is that the universe created by God has fallen
 It's interesting
 This is another point that "Genesis" always poked me
 And the facts are true
 I told you that Mesopotamians believe
 Human beings are made of Jin Gu's blood
 He is the worst monster the Chaos Behemoth can imagine
 This is a very harsh conclusion
 But the reason the Mesopotamians believe so is
 They understand as much as the author of Genesis
 Human beings are the only ones in the universe
 A creature capable of consciously deceiving and doing evil
 The question is to what extent
 Deliberate deception and evil
 Would spoil things so badly
 So that they might as well have never existed
 You will see stories like this
 There is a flood-related story in the Epic of Gilgamesh
 Have the same underlying narrative structure
 In fact, some people think that Noah’s story comes from this
 The gods regretted their creation and made a decision
 It is better to clear them than to let them thrive
 You will see the same thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth
 Early gods in "Enuma Elish"
 It can be said to be a representative of "great men on earth"
 They made too much noise, too indifferent and sloppy
 So Diamat, the original god of creation, and her partner
 Determined to purge them from the world
 If you read similar text
 If you read it from the historical perspective of UBM
 It has a depth
 Beyond the ancient and fairytale elements of the story itself
 I have read some terrible things that happened in Nazi Germany
 And what happened when Japan invaded China
 Such things are not uncommon in human history
 Things will get so bad
 It takes the imagination of an extreme villain to conceptualize it
 When things are so bad
 It can only be described by the words of the most evil person
 When I receive visiting customers
 Found another thing
 When their lives are really not good
 When they almost commit suicide or want to kill
 Or when something happened at home
 It's too corrupt and bad
 Those things can be traced back several generations ago
 Doomed to misery and destruction
 The only language that can describe this situation is religious
 Because there is no other language to describe
 The seriousness of what happened
 Maybe you have never encountered
 A situation that requires such seriousness
 But that doesn’t mean that situation doesn’t exist
 They do exist
 You will do everything you can to avoid falling into it
 But they do exist
 You encounter one or two similar situations at a certain point in your life
 This possibility is very high
 You will get entangled with someone who is inherently malicious
 Maybe the malicious person is you
 That would be a huge blow
 Then these poetic descriptions become more real
 "Only Noah found favor in the sight of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8)
 "The descendants of Noah are written below
 "Noah is a righteous man
 "At the time, I was a perfect person
 "Noah walked with God" (Genesis 6:9)
 This is an interesting verse
 If you remember the story of Adam and Eve
 What happened to Adam
 When he ate the fruit on the tree of distinguishing good from evil
 I woke up with scales falling off my eyes
 He has self-awareness and can distinguish good from evil
 When God calls him in the garden
 He did not walk with God
 So Noah is essentially no fallen Adam
 Noah did something right
 Urge God to forgive him
 Or to show him a way through chaos
 Something like this
 This is worth thinking about
 Because you will have this situation in your life
 You are facing the chaos that is about to emerge
 Maybe it was a terrible disaster in your family
 Maybe it happened
 The wider social dimension
 But chaos is coming
 What you will want to know is
 Unless you want to be a member of the chaos
 Even one of the contributors
 Maybe this is what you want
 Because in that situation many people would choose
 What you want to know is
 How to build an Ark to tide over the difficulties
 If you are interested in life
 If you are interested in an honest being
 If you don’t want to cause any unnecessary pain
 Then you will want to know
 What to do when disaster strikes
 So you have ample possibility to get over the difficulties
 Restart
 When this ancient story is told
 "Well, God is not happy, he wants to destroy everything"
 Then you better think about it seriously
 Then the story goes
 "But there is someone who follows another way of being
 "So that he survived."
 This is worth your serious consideration
 You may want to know what the mode of being
 Because you might need it
 These things are very practical in the deepest sense
 They are real in terms of possibility
 They are practical in terms of operability
 So Noah walked with God
 I’m going to jump to the New Testament
 I said at the beginning of the lecture series
 The Bible is a hyperlinked text
 Everything is connected
 Reading in order is helpful
 But the Bible is not a linear document
 The Bible is a
 There are countless ways you can
 Books to read
 you can choose
 Countless ways to read it
 All text
 Are expanding and quoting the rest of the text
 I want to jump to the Sermon on the Mount
 I think it might be
 The most critical text in the New Testament
 I think this passage
 Most clearly explain
 What does it mean to "walk with God"
 Then you will be in the ark when the flood comes
 This passage is a metaphor for "walking with God"
 The most clear presentation of the abstracted concept
 If I say you should be like Noah
 Walk with God to build the Ark
 Obviously this is a poetic and metaphorical suggestion
 Difficult to apply in practice
 You are very different from the prototype
 Not easy to put into practice in your own life
 The experience of the archetype must be distinguished and clarified
 Make it practical and personal
 So you can actually practice it
 So I will talk about part of the Sermon on the Mount
 The Sermon on the Mount begins with chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew
 But I won’t talk about the fifth chapter of Matthew
 I’ll talk about the end of Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew
 And most of Chapter 7
 "'How do you want to grow lilies in the wild
 ""It does not work nor does it spin threads" (Matthew 6:28)
 "『But I tell you
 "'When Solomon was extremely glorious
 "'What he wears is not as good as this flower'" (Matthew 6:29)
 "『You little believers
 "'The grass in the wild is still today and will be thrown in the furnace tomorrow
 ""God gave it such a decoration, how about you"" (Matthew 6:30)
 "『So don’t worry
 "『What to eat and drink
 ""What to wear"" (Matthew 6:31)
 This is a very famous verse
 Kind of like a "hippie" Christ
 Seems to mean
 "Let's do what I want" is an old saying
 "Do your own thing and you will lack nothing."
 This passage is often interpreted like this
 But this is really not a reasonable explanation
 Because this command contains implicit conditions
 This implicit condition is
 "『All the things you need
 "'Your Heavenly Father Knows'" (Matthew 6:32)
 "'You must first seek his kingdom and his righteousness
 ""These things will be added to you"" (Matthew 6:33)
 This is very different from hippies, right
 This is a very interesting point
 Must be one of the deepest views I have ever seen
 This view is to say
 If you set life goals
 What you really do
 Aiming at the highest good possible
 Then what you need
 Things that sustain daily life
 Will be added to you naturally
 This is an assumption but not a simple one
 It mainly says
 If you have the courage to do the hardest thing you can imagine
 Will make your life better than doing other things
 So how do you know if this is true
 This is what Kierkegaard said
 "Leap of Confidence"
 Unless you act
 Otherwise you can’t know if it’s true
 No one can tell you
 Because others can work
 Of course this is also very interesting
 Can others prove that it is equally feasible for you
 You must have no reservations in this game
 This view is to say
 "You must first seek his kingdom and his righteousness" (Matthew 6:33)
 When you say don't worry
 What to eat and what to wear
 This is actually a pretty important warning
 This view essentially says
 In comparison, the problem of food and clothing is trivial
 If you live right in the world
 Then most likely you will get these things
 I believe this is right
 I have observed how people behave in the world
 I think
 The most effective way to behave is
 Conceive the highest good
 And then strive to achieve it
 If you really know what success is
 Then this is success
 The most practical way
 This is the concept that this sermon wants to convey
 It’s like Pinocchio’s story
 What happened at the beginning of the Pinocchio story was
 Geppetto makes a wish to a star
 We have talked a little bit about this
 What Geppetto did is
 He conceived the highest good
 Take this as a benchmark
 He made up his mind
 Focus on that star
 For him, that star is a possible creation
 The puppet manipulated by invisible power
 Make it autonomous and real
 This is really ambitious
 We are smart enough to put it in children's movies
 But I was too stupid to understand the meaning
 This is a very interesting tie
 We can know and not know at the same time
 When you go to the movies
 May think the movie is reasonable
 But that doesn’t mean you can go home
 I think I must understand the meaning
 People are complicated
 We exist on different levels
 And there is no communication between all these levels
 But this movie puts forward a hypothesis that says
 The best way to achieve self-realization to make being noble
 Is to imagine the best thing possible
 And committed to this
 Then you might ask yourself
 This question is definitely worth asking
 "Are there other things worth doing?"
 If not then why do you do other things
 "『So don’t worry about tomorrow
 "'Because tomorrow has its own worries
 ""One day's difficulties are enough for one day" (Matthew 6:34)
 I spent a long time trying to figure out the meaning of this sentence
 Because this passage cannot
 Simply read as
 Is praising grasshoppers and ants
 It’s the old fable about grasshoppers and ants
 I am not going to tell this fable
 But the fable is about ants working and grasshoppers fooling around
 In winter, ants live very comfortably
 The grasshopper is dead
 This passage seems to affirm the grasshopper but it is not
 The scripture here is saying something else is saying
 If you are heading in the right direction
 Focus on your daily work will be effective
 I really think it fits
 Our understanding of human cognition
 The actual situation is
 The world will change around your goals
 You are a creature with purpose
 You must have a goal to act
 You are a creature that can aim
 You see a point and move towards it
 This is born
 So you have to have a goal
 Assuming your goal is the highest goal
 The world around you will be constructed by goals
 This goal will build all your knowledge
 Also decide what you see and what you can't see
 So are your emotions and motivations
 So you build yourself around this goal
 Then what will happen is
 You will encounter a series of challenges and problems in the moment
 If you solve the problem properly
 Then you will continue to move towards this goal
 You can concentrate on the moment
 So you can have both fish and bear paws
 Because you can point far away
 Live in the present at the same time
 in my opinion
 This will make every moment of the moment full of meaning
 If everything you do every day
 It's all about the highest goal you can imagine
 This is the meaning of sustaining your life
 Back to Noah's story
 The sky is falling and chaos is coming
 If you face such a problem in life
 You might want to do something
 Really valuable things
 Because when the flood floods everything
 Something like this can save you from death
 Don't you want to wait until the flood comes
 Just start to do it
 If the ark is only half built and you still can't sail
 Then chances are you will drown
 "'So, don't worry about tomorrow
 "'Because tomorrow has its own worries
 ""One day's difficulties are enough for one day" (Matthew 6:34)
 This is not an optimistic assumption
 "'Don't judge people, lest you be judged'" (Matthew 7:1)
 "'Because you will be judged just as you judge people
 "『What measure do you use to measure
 ""What measure must be used to measure for you"" (Matthew 7:2)
 This is a realistic description
 I will not call this passage a suggestion
 Because i think this is not a recommendation
 This is a description of the structure of reality
 It is not the same as the suggestion
 What it says is
 "What game do you choose to play
 "It will be bound by the rules of this game."
 This fits perfectly
 Our understanding of human psychology
 You must be allowed to play the game
 Others must be able to cooperate with you during the game
 Have to be able to compete with you
 You may have some chance
 Change the way the game is played
 But can you participate in the game
 Can't help you decide
 You are in the game
 You will be bound by the rules of the game
 This is how the game works
 You better pick one
 You are willing to play games that are responsible for the rules
 "'Why do you see a thorn in your brother's eye
 ""But I don't want to have beams in my eyes"" (Matthew 7:3)
 "『You have beams in your own eyes
 "'How can you tell your brother
 "" "Let me remove the thorns from your eyes"" (Matthew 7:4)
 You may not know what beam is
 A thorn is only as big as a grain of dust
 The beam is a big piece of wood
 So the problem is not how blind others are
 Even if others are more blind than you
 The problem described here is
 You should care first
 "What interferes with your own vision"
 You shouldn't interfere with others on such issues
 If your mode of being in the world is
 You only do things that are helpful to you
 Or you think evil and disaster
 none of your business
 Others need to solve these problems
 It's the responsibility of others
 Then you won't solve the problem
 No matter what you did or did not do
 You will stay blind
 This won't make things better
 So it's best to think like this
 "I'm probably blind in many ways
 "Maybe there is a way to correct it."
 Because you are very likely to be blind in all aspects
 In fact it almost must be like this
 So think about "Where did I go wrong?"
 Would be more helpful
 I want to share some things I learned
 I learned when arguing with my wife, we often argue
 When you start a real discussion with others
 You will find that there are many things that cannot be agreed upon
 Because you are indeed different creatures
 If you want to have a sincere conversation
 Will find
 The way you look at things is different
 You can pretend that this is not the case
 Cover up the past
 Finally turned into a 30-year cold war
 Or you can have a big fight in time
 See if we can resolve the contradiction
 When we are arguing
 Get into this situation from time to time
 dilemma
 Will also be upgraded to "hate speech"
 Ha everyone laughed
 Because people know that they are
 How many hurtful things have been said
 So one thing we learned is
 When we are deadlocked
 We separate first
 Sit down and think about it
 "It’s not very happy now."
 "We don't know what to do next."
 I always think
 "Of course it's her fault"
 "It's obviously her fault
 "At least she has 95% responsibility"
 "But maybe I also have 5% responsibility"
 I will sit down and think
 Then ask myself a question
 "Did I do anything in the past six months
 "Make this kind of deadlock more likely"
 You don't know how fast your brain will
 To answer this question
 No doubt you did some stupid things
 You know in your heart that you remember these things
 These things have improved to make you think
 Probability of strangling your lover
 Then you can tell them these things
 Then you can talk
 Especially if they did the same thing
 You would say "I am such an idiot"
 The other person will say "Okay"
 "I'm such an idiot too"
 Then you two are idiots
 Maybe you can talk about it
 "『You hypocrites
 "『First remove the beam from my eyes
 "『Then I can see clearly
 ""Remove the thorns from your brother's eyes"" (Matthew 7:5)
 Hard to disagree with this
 "『If you ask, I will give you
 "'Look and find
 ""Knock and open the door for you"" (Matthew 7:7)
 "'Because whoever prays will receive
 "'He who seeks will find
 "'He who knocks will open the door for him'" (Matthew 7:8)
 This also sounds very optimistic
 But also I think this is a description of the structure of reality
 I mean
 I observed during clinical treatment
 I can see it in my students
 People's lives are not what they want
 You will ask "Why do you say that?"
 Let’s not mention the tragedies and disasters in life
 It goes without saying
 We do not discuss this issue
 Although to varying degrees
 Your tragedy was created by you
 But I don’t think every bad thing happens to people
 Are all deserved results
 I think this is a very dangerous premise
 Especially because everyone will get sick and die
 One of the main reasons why people cannot get what they want
 Because I didn’t figure out what I really wanted
 You might get something good for you
 This may be better than what you want
 You may easily get wrong what you want
 But you may get something that is really good for you
 Why can't you get it
 Because you don't try
 You didn't think like this
 "What if I had this"
 I'm not saying
 You have to force it by manipulating the world
 Dedicated to you something like property or status
 That was not what I meant
 I'm talking about
 Imagine you are taking care of yourself
 Like taking care of the person you care about most
 Then you think "I am taking care of this person
 "I hope the best things happen to this person"
 "What does this person's life look like?
 "Is it possible?"
 People don't do it
 People don't sit down and think
 "Okay, let's figure it out."
 Obviously your life is difficult
 After three years you can get what you need
 But you have to be careful about this
 You can't have everything
 You can get what is good for you
 But you have to figure out what it is
 Then you have to target it
 From my experience with people
 If they understand what is good
 Then target it and finally you can achieve the goal
 This is a strange thing
 Not that simple
 You can have an idea about what is good for you
 Then take ten steps in this direction
 Then you will find that the planning is a bit wrong
 You have to re-plan your goals
 You seem to be walking towards the goal like this
 But a big reason many people fail is
 They never set the standard of success
 Because success is a narrow road and not easy to walk through
 Your chance of success is zero
 So this is a proposition
 The proposition is like this
 If you really want something
 You can have it
 The issue is
 What is really what you want
 The answer is that you have to readjust all aspects of life
 Do your best to make this happen
 This is the concept of sacrifice, right
 Obviously you won't get everything
 But maybe you can get what you need
 All you have to do is to seek
 But seeking is not a whim
 Or just today’s wish
 You have to take it very seriously
 You have to think about it
 I want to measure myself
 If I want to live correctly in this world
 If i want to be a
 I think I am more satisfied
 I don't mean you have to criticize yourself strictly
 So what am I aiming for
 I found one thing
 You can try
 Can test this method
 Is a form of prayer
 It's like "knocking"
 Sit on the bed one day and ask yourself
 "I will often do stupid things
 "It will definitely mess up my life."
 If you really ask
 But you must also want to know the answer
 This is the real meaning of the question
 Can't just talk casually
 You have to make sure you want to know the answer
 And you will soon find
 The answer will shock you
 Jung thought about it
 He believes that human consciousness can be divided into two polarities
 One is the personal consciousness of each of us
 The other one he called "self-nature"
 You can think of "self" as the inner divinity
 This expression is more accurate
 This is the universal part of your consciousness that is conscience
 It's okay to think so
 No matter what your conscience is
 You can ask for advice
 Similar to Socrates' "Demon"
 Socrates said he was different from other beings in ancient Greece
 It’s because he would ask his own "Demon" that is his "elf"
 He bowed back and asked himself how to behave in the world
 Then follow the inner instructions and put it into practice
 No matter what the instructions
 Socrates did not selfishly demand an answer
 He will ask
 "I want to show my best self in the world
 "I want to do that, what kind of self is that"
 You are fully capable of thinking, God knows why
 You are also fully capable of imagine
 God knows why you are so whimsical
 If you bend yourself and ask yourself what is the best ending
 Then what will happen
 Maybe you will get the answer
 This is what it means
 "'Who among you has a son asks for bread
 ""Give him a stone"" (Matthew 7:9)
 ""If you ask for a fish or give him a snake" (Matthew 7:10)
 "『You are not good
 "『I know that I can give good things to my children
 "'Not to mention your Father in heaven,
 ""Would you not give more good things to those who beg him"" (Matthew 7:11)
 I think this involves the fundamental nature of being
 A hypothesis in the New Testament
 In a way it is another hypothesis
 Different from the one in the structure of the Old Testament
 That is, faith makes beings good
 This proposal is very interesting
 So this concept becomes a behavior-oriented problem
 You put the following proposal into practice
 I.e. if you behave properly in the world
 Being will be presented to you in the form of goodness
 But you can only know after putting it into practice
 So this is a call
 Make you feel "If you behave properly in the world
 The proposal of "being will be good" is put into practice
 There is no reason to assume the opposite
 Assuming its opposite
 Will become cynical and full of resentment
 It’s not that we have no reason to assume its opposite
 It’s not that I can’t understand why people are full of resentment
 "'So whatever you want to do with you
 "『How do you treat others
 "'Because this is the doctrine of the law and the prophets'" (Matthew 7:12)
 This is a question of reciprocity, right
 This is another experience I learned from Jung
 Jung did not interpret this way
 This is the so-called "Golden Rule"
 Is often understood as "being kind to others"
 But this rule does not mean that
 Can't even touch the sides
 it mean
 Let's say in reverse
 This will focus the problem on you
 Instead of focusing on others to understand
 this means
 Conceptualize the question of "how to make things good"
 If things are good for you
 If you are taking care of yourself
 Then try to benefit others
 This is reflected in Buddhism
 Sakyamuni entered Nirvana
 The story is like this
 Then he was tempted to stay in Nirvana
 But he refused and returned to the secular world
 Because he felt that it was not enough to reach Nirvana by himself
 Let everyone reach Nirvana at the same time
 To the effect
 Treat yourself right
 It's not easy
 Because you are depraved and shameless
 Cowardly and full of nonsense
 An evil and shameful mortal
 So it’s not easy, you know it well
 It is not easy to treat such a creature correctly
 Can't take it for granted
 People tend to treat themselves better than others
 I don’t think this is obvious at all
 But maybe you can start from yourself and tell yourself
 "I have to treat myself as if I am worthy"
 Then what will it be like
 I will apply this thoughtfulness to others later
 The assumption here is
 If you pass humans
 Moral wisdom gained from thousands of hardships
 Through evolution and then manifested in various metaphors and stories
 And was codified into the written law
 Pick out a rule that is above all else
 Then it is the principle
 This is very interesting
 Because it’s saying "this is the law and the prophet"
 The law is the rule
 But the prophet is the process of rule update
 So in a sense the prophet is above the law
 So the view of this particular expression is
 Efforts to improve their own mode of being
 And committed to perfecting the existence of others
 This maxim is not just the core of the law
 It is also the core of the process of formulating the renewal law
 The meaning behind this sentence is very deep
 "'You have to enter the narrow gate
 "'Because the door to destruction is wide
 ""The road is big, and there are many people going in"" (Matthew 7:13)
 Dare to ask anyone in the world who can argue with it
 Anyone who is sober and sane knows
 There are thousands of ways to mess things up
 There is only one way to do it right, or if you are lucky
 So realize the path you take when you are doing the right thing
 It’s actually very narrow. This is wisdom.
 That is the dividing line between chaos and order
 You should always stand on this dividing line
 The dividing line is very thin
 If you lean slightly to one side
 Then there is too much chaos
 And lean slightly in the other direction
 Then there will be too much order
 Neither situation is good
 The balance must be just right
 You can feel it yourself
 I really think you can feel it
 This is your deep-rooted instinct
 I mean biological instinct
 Not a metaphor
 I think your mind is to adapt to
 Constructed by living in a universe made of chaos and order
 I think this is why you have two halves of the brain
 This is more profound than metaphor
 When you feel yourself
 Participate in world time in a meaningful way
 When you put aside the fear of death
 It's eternity when you put yourself in the world
 It’s your innermost instinct that tells you
 You are in the right place at the right time
 All you have to do is practice repeatedly to be in the present position
 That spot is hard to find
 You will find it if you are lucky if you wander around that point
 You can observe it as an experiment
 Observe yourself like a stranger for two weeks
 You really don't know yourself
 So try to observe yourself for two weeks
 You will notice that sometimes things go smoothly
 But it’s not easy to notice
 Because when everything goes well
 You will be obsessed with being unable to pay attention to it
 But you will find yourself in the right place
 "So how did I come to this place
 "What did I do right
 "How can we always go smoothly
 "I hope it gets better
 "How should I act
 "It will be smoother in the future."
 Then you train
 Maybe it’s no longer a month or a week for 10 minutes to observe yourself
 But after 15 minutes a day, half an hour a day
 Then one hour a day and four hours a day
 Then if you are very cautious
 Can do it most of the time
 "『The way to eternal life is narrow or small
 "'There are few people looking for it'" (Matthew 7:14)
 "『You must be on guard against false prophets
 "'They come to you in sheep's clothing
 "'There is a cruel wolf inside'" (Matthew 7:15)
 This is a very good suggestion for the current political situation
 I can guarantee this
 "'You can recognize them by their fruits
 "'How can you pick grapes on thorns?
 ""How can figs be picked from thistles"" (Matthew 7:16)
 "'So every good tree bears good fruit
 ""Only a bad tree bears bad fruit"" (Matthew 7:17)
 This is what I learned from
 Known in the history of totalitarianism in the 20th century
 "Only the bad tree bears bad fruit." That’s for sure
 Something interesting
 When people think
 People will use a primitive and naive way
 Think about your relationship with divinity or God
 Why can't miracles be revealed
 So that I firmly believe in its existence
 It’s funny that you won’t just believe it
 If the miracle does appear
 You will forget it in about half a year
 You think you won't forget when the time comes, but you will
 You will really forget about it
 Because of human nature
 But actually catastrophic miracles are happening all the time
 This point strengthens my argument
 You just won't pay attention
 If we cannot learn from the history of the 20th century
 Then we are completely incapable of learning
 The history of the 20th century is
 A collection of hardships and lessons beyond human imagination
 The following paragraph can't be described more appropriately
 ""Bad tree bears bad fruit"" (Matthew 7:17)
 ""A good tree cannot bear bad fruit
 ""A bad tree cannot produce good fruit"" (Matthew 7:18)
 "'Cut down any tree that doesn't produce good fruit
 ""Throw in the fire"" (Matthew 7:19)
 This is the flood theme
 Archetype of the eternal tree
 Archetype of being
 This is often the prototype of the self
 What's the warning here
 If you are deadwood
 You can easily burn
 You can think about it metaphysically
 Can be mapped to eternity
 Think of it as hell
 Interestingly
 When it all happens to you in reality
 Just like being in eternal hell
 Thinking like this makes perfect sense
 But you can also remove the metaphysical part
 Think of it this way, if you are almost a dead tree
 Then it will stop
 This is also worth thinking about
 "『So with their fruits
 ""You can recognize them" (Matthew 7:20)
 "'Whoever calls me "Lord Lord"
 "『You can’t enter heaven
 "『Only those who do the will of my Father
 ""You can get in"" (Matthew 7:21)
 I think this sentence is quite interesting
 There is such a reasonable critique of traditional Christianity
 This is also the criticism given by Nietzsche
 That Christianity failed to fulfill its moral mission
 Jung is a little more forgiving
 I will tell you why later
 Nietzsche thinks that traditional Christianity has lost its way
 Because it assumes
 In a certain ultimate sense, mankind has been saved by the sacrifice of Jesus
 This means the work is done
 I will make a harsher evaluation now
 This is for succinct language
 The theme of traditional Christianity is
 If you express belief in what has happened
 Then you have obtained eternal salvation
 The meaning of this layer is not so simple
 But I think this is the true meaning of this sentence
 This sentence asks "Then how do you enter heaven?"
 You can think about this problem from an eternal perspective
 Or from a psychological level
 Then the answer is very straightforward
 Imitate Noah's work to survive the flood
 Walk with God
 That is the meaning of the admonition
 This is the practical development of the admonition
 Also set the goal as the highest good
 And act in the world
 So you might have a chance
 The highest form of good inhabiting your being
 Maybe no chance
 But you can’t think of a more practical way
 If you build a house, maybe you can live in it
 If you don't build a house
 Then can't live in it
 If you build a good house
 Then you can live in a good house
 If you build a perfect house
 Then you may live in a perfect house
 But if the house has been built for you
 You just verbally said that the house has been built for you
 Then you can live in a house that meets your needs
 The possibility does not exist
 "『That day (Judgment Day), many people will say to me
 "『Lord, Lord, we didn’t preach in your name
 "『“In your name cast out ghosts
 ""Do you perform many miracles in your name?"" (Matthew 7:22)
 "『I told them clearly
 "『I never knew you
 ""You evildoers, leave me"" (Matthew 7:23)
 It refers to Judgment Day
 That is a prototype concept
 Part of the reason it is a prototype is
 Every day is judgment day
 The logos of you
 The ideal part of you
 Will always be judged for your sins
 It's guilt shame retreat
 And the source of resentment, murder and genocide
 Because you can intuitively know what is ideal
 The problem is
 Ideals always exist as judges
 There is no difference between the two
 So you will never stop being judged by your ideals
 If there is no ideal
 Then your life has no direction or meaning
 Of course the more perfect your ideal, the stricter the judgment
 Jung was curious
 Why does the Bible add a "Revelation" at the end
 Because "Revelation" is a very strange book
 Christ in the Gospels
 It can be said to be mainly kind
 Christianity
 The truth and mercy are always at war
 Competing between the two, kindness probably prevails
 Jung’s observation is that the Christ in the Gospels is too kind
 This is also the "Revelation"
 Continuing to the reason for the end of the New Testament
 Because in "Revelation"
 Christ is the transcendent ideal hanging above the pyramid
 He is the absolute judge
 No one can pass
 Of course the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge
 This is its prototype reality
 You can say that I don't want to be judged
 I don't want to have anything to do with ideals
 Then you become Cain
 Cain gave up his ideal
 But you can't escape
 You can't escape the eternal judgment
 This is a prototype story
 People put a lot of effort into these works
 Created hundreds of expressions
 They are not jokes
 These are serious works
 We can't understand
 Does not mean those who created these works
 Don't know what i'm doing
 Those creators are geniuses
 Not to say what they mean to themselves
 Have precise and clear understanding
 But what they are expressing is
 Metaphors at the core of our culture
 The effect is to make our culture work well and intrinsically good
 These metaphors are the foundation of our culture
 They are not created for the coward
 Some people say that religion is the opium of the people
 Then I have a question. How do you explain this?
 Because if you are looking for opium
 What else does this jury do?
 Another interesting thing about this statement is
 Look at the "Revelation" and look at the trials
 Almost everyone was eventually found guilty
 So if some kind of sad desire is to be realized
 Then why do you tilt the balance like this
 Do you think it will make people feel good
 I don't think so
 There is almost no picture of the whole picture
 Things that make people feel good
 If you understand it well
 The fear it brings you will touch the depths of your soul
 That's the purpose of the picture
 "'So anyone who hears me will do it
 "『Like a smart person
 ""Build the house on the rock"" (Matthew 7:24)
 "『The rain and the wind blow
 "'The house won't collapse when hitting that house
 ""Because the foundation is on the rock"" (Matthew 7:25)
 "'Anyone who hears me and doesn't do it
 "『Like an ignorant person
 ""Build the house on the sand"" (Matthew 7:26)
 "『The rain and the wind blow
 ""Bumping into that house"" (Matthew 7:27)
 Oh here is the wrong number
 ""The house collapsed because the house was built on sand (Matthew 7:27)
 This sentence is very interesting
 Sometimes you will read certain sentences
 Especially in the context of the Bible
 You will see words that you can’t believe their real existence
 hard to imagine
 Someone can come up with such a sentence
 I think the following two sentences are good examples
 "Jesus finished these words
 "Everyone is amazed by his teaching" (Matthew 7:28)
 "Because he taught them that they are just like powerful people
 "Not like their scribes" (Matthew 7:29)
 This is interesting
 Because I don’t appreciate it
 One of the reasons for those churches I've been to
 Those classes are taught by scribes
 Talking full of words from the Bible
 Without any power
 Can't read meaning from it
 Like what I did when I was 20
 I will say those meaningless words
 Those words are just nice
 I think those words are like gilded clothing
 You can wrap it around
 But it doesn’t have any substantial meaning
 Something with substantial connotation
 And listening to those fancy and fluent things
 The difference is huge
 This sentence means
 Those who say the things we just described
 It sounds like someone who knows what he is talking about
 Instead of just repeating preaching
 Just for those who say beautiful things
 in my opinion
 These words we just reviewed together
 Contains awesome authority influence
 Back to Noah
 "Only Noah found favor in the sight of the Lord" (Gen 6:8)
 "The descendants of Noah are written below
 "Noah was a righteous man in the generations he was a perfect man
 "Noah walked with God" (Genesis 6:9)
 "Noah gave birth to three sons
 "It's Shemham Yaphos" (Genesis 6:10)
 "The world is corrupted before God
 "The ground is full of violence" (Genesis 6:11)
 Have you seen the new advertisement of the American Rifle Association
 You better check
 I think this is what i see
 The most shocking manifestation of American political polarization
 I have seen a lot of leftists
 Most of the people who shocked me most came from the left
 But this advertisement really opened my eyes
 The ad is voiced by a very attractive woman
 She looks a bit like Demi Moore
 But she looks fierce
 I guess Demi Moore looks fierce sometimes
 This lady has a disdain
 It is very dangerous
 Only the riots about the "anti-fascist movement" in the background
 And images of the riot flame protests in Berkeley
 She described these as conspiracies
 Is a conspiracy involving the intellectual elite
 Hollywood was named and named
 She accused a group of corrupt intellectuals
 Is disintegrating this country
 It's time to pick up your guns
 You can look at this ad and experience it for yourself
 If things go in this direction
 Many people will be ecstatic
 What i hope is
 We can solve this problem in a civilized way
 But the current situation is the stupidity of any individual
 Can take us one step further from the end
 15% or 30% of the population is this kind of people who are afraid of chaos
 They will be ecstatic
 Because this is their goal
 "The world is corrupted before God
 "The ground is full of violence" (Genesis 6:11)
 "God sees the world is corrupt
 "All flesh and blood have corrupted their behavior on earth" (Genesis 6:12)
 "God said to Noah
 "'The end of anyone who is full of flesh has come to me
 "'Because the ground is full of their rape
 "'I will destroy them with the earth'" (Genesis 6:13)
 "'You have to build an ark out of Gopher wood
 "『Build one by one
 ""Put rosin inside and out"" (Genesis 6:14)
 "'This is how the Ark is made
 ""Three hundred cubits long
 ""50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high"" (Genesis 6:15)
 "'There must be a light-transmitting place on the ark
 "『One cubit high
 "'The door of the ark must be opened aside
 ""The Ark shall be divided into three levels: upper, middle and lower" (Genesis 6:16)
 "'Look, I will make the flood flood the earth and destroy the world
 "'Every living creature with flesh and breath on the earth,
 ""No one does not die"" (Genesis 6:17)
 "'I want to make a covenant with you
 "『You and your wife and sons and wives
 ""All to enter the Ark" (Genesis 6:18)
 This is a very optimistic reversal
 Noah can save not only himself but the whole family
 Shade the descendants
 This is a good thing
 One of my patients
 Her growth experience has been rough
 At least I didn’t get a lot of encouragement
 But a lot of frustration
 She has a son
 Speaking of her relationship with her son
 It is very interesting
 Those misfortunes would have passed on to her son through her
 Even though she herself was tortured
 Because some people want to make her suffer
 But she saved her son from the same treatment
 From her pain and suffering
 She learned a negative lesson
 Just don’t let this behavior pass on
 So what I want to express here is
 If you are upright, behave reasonably
 And walk with God in the way we discussed
 Maybe this will not only benefit you alone
 And will save your family
 It also implies that this might save a society
 This is what Noah did
 He saved himself and saved his family
 But the surrounding area was swept away by the flood
 His reasonable behavior saved himself and his family
 Also saved the world
 It’s interesting that I’ve read a lot about totalitarian disasters
 The work of the person who has thought deeply
 I think Alexander Solzhenitsyn is second to none
 His anthology
 A total of 700 pages in three volumes, each page is densely packed
 Are calling for
 personal
 The necessity of personal honesty and integrity
 It is the only fortress that can resist the catastrophe of totalitarianism
 I have read a lot
 The author who wants to find the bane of the 20th century
 I think Solzhenitsyn gave
 Same conclusion as Victor Frank
 Because he experienced the Nazi concentration camp in his early years
 I also admire Frank
 But Solzhenitsyn brought this topic
 Brings another level of depth
 And the argument strongly points out
 Causes of social deterioration
 Every individual in the society becomes corrupt
 And the only way to save
 Is every individual in the society
 Reject corruption within their ability to live
 He talked a lot about the people he met in Gulagre
 The Gulag here refers to the death camp in the Soviet Union.
 This is what he learned
 Those people are so strong
 Even in the most extreme cases
 They will never
 Cross the straight and narrow bottom line
 The authorities can't do anything about them
 Just watching this is enough to change Solzhenitsyn
 Of course, after spending some time in the labor camp
 He also thought about
 "How did I fall into this field?"
 Hitler’s fault, Stalin’s fault
 Although it is certain that both of them are at fault
 But for Solzhenitsyn he felt that he was also at fault
 Because he is also in the same game
 It’s just a bad game
 "'Any living creature with flesh and blood
 "『Two each, one male and one female
 "『You have to bring into the Ark
 ""Fortunately to save life from you"" (Genesis 6:19)
 Another message in the story is
 Dependent on Noah’s correct behavior
 Not only him and his family and human society
 But the creatures of the whole earth
 Take the limitlessly and use the extreme
 And the era of widespread hypocrisy
 This is something worth thinking about
 Maybe this is the best behavior for everything
 Including for those things outside the boundaries of human society
 To regulate one's own behavior
 From the smallest micro level to the final macro level
 Regulate yourself in all dimensions of your being
 This is the salvation of all beings
 This is the main point of this story
 As a cynical modern person
 We are interpreting it like a primitive man
 Only primitive people will believe
 Someone can build a boat and bring two for each species
 So we can save the world
 Any work is interpreted so superficially
 Are unbearable
 Especially those who cannot use ignorance as an excuse
 These stories are for everyone to see, right
 There are many people in the world who are not very smart
 So they like to understand things rigidly
 Just like how your child understands when you read a story book to your child
 This story can be understood rigidly
 Because this story is for everyone
 But if you are mature enough
 You shouldn’t understand it in a child’s way
 Maybe you have an obligation to dig deeper meanings
 Then think about
 If this story is only what the fool sees
 If there is no deeper connotation
 It will not spread for thousands of years

 I have heard of critics
 For example, David Suzuki
 Claims to be the substructure of Western civilization
 As shown in the text above
 Is sending the earth into human hands
 And is justifying our abuse of being
 I think this interpretation is not cautious
 I think such an important thing
 It is necessary to interpret with a more cautious attitude
 In the story of Adam and Eve
 When Adam and Eve were driven out of Paradise
 God says she will obey her husband
 He didn't say this should happen
 What he said is this will happen
 I think in these words
 Have the same meaning
 This event may not have happened
 It has happened
 It’s hard to imagine how long ago these words were written
 It was not obvious until the 1960s
 We completely control the earth
 So that we have the future in our hands
 This reflects the prophetic element in this story
 "'The beasts on the earth and the birds in the sky
 "'I will be frightened and afraid of you
 "'Even all the insects on the ground and all the fish in the sea
 ""Hands over to you"" (Genesis 9:2)
 That’s how it became reality
 "'Any living animal can be your food
 "『I give you all this
 ""Like vegetables" (Genesis 9:3)
 "'Only flesh with blood is its life
 ""You must not eat"" (Genesis 9:4)
 "'Blood you to kill you
 ""Whether it is a beast or a human, I will punish him
 "'Even to everyone's brothers'" (Genesis 9:5)
 This chapter is difficult to interpret
 Its meaning is like this
 God explains the reborn human
 Have master of the earth
 And enumerate the power to dominate
 Then draw a line of power
 The limit is no matter how big the authority is
 Should keep the dignity of life
 Although it’s difficult to extract this meaning from an article translated this way
 What God wants to tell Noah is
 If you kill yourself and kill others
 If animals kill humans
 Have to pay the price
 So there is such a possibility
 Noah’s descendants can dominate the earth
 Moral boundary
 I.e. anyway
 Life itself should be regarded as sacred and dignified
 "'Anyone who sheds blood will also be shed
 "'Because God created man in His own image'" (Genesis 9:6)
 "『You have to bear and grow many
 ""Prosperity on the earth" (Genesis 9:7)
 "God spoke to Noah and his sons" (Genesis 9:8)
 ""I make a covenant with you and your descendants"" (Genesis 9:9)
 "『And with all the living creatures here
 "'It's birds, livestock, and beasts
 ""All living creatures that come out of the ark make a covenant" (Genesis 9:10)
 "『I make a covenant with you
 "'All flesh and blood will no longer be extinct by the flood
 ""There will be no more floods destroying the land" (Gen 9:11)
 "God said
 "『I and you
 "『And the eternal covenant made by all the living creatures here
 ""It is marked"" (Genesis 9:12)
 "『I put the rainbow in the clouds

 "『I will remember
 "『My covenant with you and all living creatures
 "『The water will never overflow
 ""Destroy all flesh and blood"" (Genesis 9:15)
 Here is an agreement similar to negotiation
 This negotiated agreement
 In my opinion
 If humans agree to be upright like Noah
 The threat of catastrophic destruction will not come
 "'The rainbow must now be in the clouds
 "'I will remember when I see it
 "『I and every living creature on the earth
 ""The Eternal Covenant" (Genesis 9:16)

 Let's come to an end here
 By the way, there will be no lectures next week
 Because the theater was booked
 So let's take a week off
 We will finish Noah’s story when we come back
 Not much left
 Then we will talk about the story of the Tower of Babel
 Is a short but interesting story
 Then we will tell the story of Abraham
