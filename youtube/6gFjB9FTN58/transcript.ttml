<p begin="00:00:18.246" end="00:00:18.653" style="s2"> thank you all</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.837" end="00:00:22.703" style="s2"> I took a look today</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.703" end="00:00:27.181" style="s2"> This series of lectures has now been broadcasted over 1 million online</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.632" end="00:00:30.887" style="s2"> Pretty amazing</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.473" end="00:00:40.219" style="s2"> Or they are only viewed 1 million times</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.327" end="00:00:43.455" style="s2"> This is also possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:46.377" style="s2"> Okay, let&#39;s go directly to the topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.432" end="00:00:51.931" style="s2"> I think last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.931" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2"> There is too little content related to the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.371" end="00:01:01.805" style="s2"> Let me summarize what was laid out last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.206" end="00:01:07.682" style="s2"> Set up a frame for tonight’s discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.901" end="00:01:19.238" style="s2"> I basically describe this picture in detail for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.238" end="00:01:21.252" style="s2"> It took me a long time to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.670" end="00:01:24.530" style="s2"> About 25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.146" end="00:01:27.922" style="s2"> This may be why this picture looks so primitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.937" end="00:01:32.922" style="s2"> Seriously, I put my 486 computer</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.016" end="00:01:34.196" style="s2"> Run to the limit to make this picture</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.183" end="00:01:40.417" style="s2"> This picture is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.417" end="00:01:42.421" style="s2"> A manifestation of the life prototype situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:47.150" style="s2"> These prototype situations</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.912" end="00:01:51.993" style="s2"> It&#39;s true no matter when and where</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.308" end="00:01:54.394" style="s2"> So you can think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.603" end="00:01:57.599" style="s2"> Description of the essential characteristics of human experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:01.002" style="s2"> This is not the same as reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.446" end="00:02:09.926" style="s2"> Because you can divide reality into subjective and objective elements</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.584" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2"> This is effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.891" end="00:02:15.146" style="s2"> But these manifestations will not be so distinguished</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.219" end="00:02:23.778" style="s2"> They believe that human experience is an integral part of reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.853" end="00:02:26.085" style="s2"> We also experienced this</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.148" end="00:02:27.202" style="s2"> So we just follow this</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:28.507" style="s2"> This basically means</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.507" end="00:02:32.306" style="s2"> We always exist in an incomplete structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.071" end="00:02:38.027" style="s2"> Part of this structure is biological</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.141" end="00:02:40.198" style="s2"> Partly social and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.219" end="00:02:44.572" style="s2"> Part of it was passed on to us by our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.177" end="00:02:47.567" style="s2"> As far as the underlying architecture is concerned, the same is true from the practicality</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.567" end="00:02:49.436" style="s2"> Psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.436" end="00:02:55.532" style="s2"> This is also true for the content we learn autonomously</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.116" end="00:03:00.521" style="s2"> Including, for example, our ability to use language</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.814" end="00:03:02.087" style="s2"> Words and sentences used</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.087" end="00:03:05.365" style="s2"> Also formed through communication and interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.386" end="00:03:07.275" style="s2"> Mutual understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.707" end="00:03:15.354" style="s2"> In terms of prototype, this system is always old and corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.244" end="00:03:18.413" style="s2"> It&#39;s dead because</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.413" end="00:03:19.801" style="s2"> It is constructed by the dead</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.292" end="00:03:21.607" style="s2"> It is rotten because</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.066" end="00:03:24.363" style="s2"> Things will always fall apart spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.688" end="00:03:28.695" style="s2"> And the fact that people don’t establish goals and directions</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.572" end="00:03:31.555" style="s2"> Accelerated the process of degeneration</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.196" end="00:03:35.741" style="s2"> I think you need to pay attention to some things</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.162" end="00:03:39.979" style="s2"> People always stand aside</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.979" end="00:03:40.949" style="s2"> Wait to see when these problems disappear by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.985" end="00:03:45.177" style="s2"> I mean to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.440" end="00:03:50.167" style="s2"> Young people always have many reasons for the status quo of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.187" end="00:03:52.171" style="s2"> Feel cynical</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.997" end="00:03:54.968" style="s2"> Always be like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.544" end="00:03:57.578" style="s2"> I think in this view</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.578" end="00:04:02.985" style="s2"> Concepts such as patriarchal society are very useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.486" end="00:04:04.874" style="s2"> The social structure is corrupt and incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.937" end="00:04:08.517" style="s2"> Is a prototype fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.759" end="00:04:10.699" style="s2"> this means</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.699" end="00:04:12.473" style="s2"> To some extent your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.745" end="00:04:16.012" style="s2"> Have to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.077" end="00:04:19.446" style="s2"> This is a constant fact of existence itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.563" end="00:04:27.056" style="s2"> So the incomplete social structure we live in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.233" end="00:04:28.653" style="s2"> Or even biological structure</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.653" end="00:04:31.492" style="s2"> Feel angry and frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.778" end="00:04:35.146" style="s2"> I feel all this is for myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.146" end="00:04:36.315" style="s2"> But the worst</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.346" end="00:04:37.964" style="s2"> I feel all this is against myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.507" end="00:04:41.461" style="s2"> Is a misunderstanding of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.202" end="00:04:44.290" style="s2"> Because of what you are given and where you live</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.290" end="00:04:47.338" style="s2"> Is degraded and corrupt and needs to be corrected</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.382" end="00:04:50.939" style="s2"> Always like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.455" end="00:04:55.229" style="s2"> This fact is not difficult to accept</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.200" end="00:04:58.162" style="s2"> Because it also has positive factors</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.382" end="00:04:59.499" style="s2"> That is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.127" end="00:05:02.463" style="s2"> At least you were given something</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.235" end="00:05:04.133" style="s2"> Instead of nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.762" end="00:05:07.828" style="s2"> And didn&#39;t give you pure hell</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.828" end="00:05:10.083" style="s2"> Because especially in our western culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.093" end="00:05:12.463" style="s2"> Many things are working well</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.964" end="00:05:14.238" style="s2"> There are many things to be grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.238" end="00:05:15.709" style="s2"> Even a broken machine</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.772" end="00:05:17.233" style="s2"> Not completely hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.265" end="00:05:19.154" style="s2"> It didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.238" end="00:05:20.334" style="s2"> every moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.334" end="00:05:22.265" style="s2"> All make you trapped in pain and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.651" end="00:05:23.757" style="s2"> It can easily become like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.757" end="00:05:25.668" style="s2"> Because many societies are like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.242" end="00:05:28.329" style="s2"> We have not lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.279" end="00:05:30.876" style="s2"> A society that is so corrupted beyond imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.200" end="00:05:33.997" style="s2"> This fact is very grateful</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.075" end="00:05:38.465" style="s2"> So we all live in a broken structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.843" end="00:05:42.453" style="s2"> We are also responsible for its incompleteness because</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.415" end="00:05:48.058" style="s2"> We haven’t been doing our best to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.164" end="00:05:51.263" style="s2"> You might say this is a basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.962" end="00:05:53.757" style="s2"> People always ask what is the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.258" end="00:05:56.377" style="s2"> What they really want to ask is what is the positive meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.409" end="00:05:57.567" style="s2"> Because like we said</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.714" end="00:05:59.801" style="s2"> The negative meaning of life is somewhat self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.699" end="00:06:02.922" style="s2"> However, the positive meaning is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.319" end="00:06:09.029" style="s2"> Realize that the siege you live in needs to be repaired</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.728" end="00:06:12.964" style="s2"> Then ran to do something</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.995" end="00:06:15.876" style="s2"> For example, fill in the gap and repair the wall</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.897" end="00:06:18.924" style="s2"> The structure you live in</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.561" end="00:06:24.770" style="s2"> Be as safe and productive as possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.317" end="00:06:30.031" style="s2"> You do not lack the opportunity to do so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.031" end="00:06:33.235" style="s2"> You can do it in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.235" end="00:06:34.770" style="s2"> You can do this in your room</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.770" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2"> You can do this in your family</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.628" end="00:06:37.995" style="s2"> You can do this in your community</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.778" end="00:06:41.858" style="s2"> If you do this thing well on these levels</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.858" end="00:06:43.653" style="s2"> You can set the goal higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.311" end="00:06:45.292" style="s2"> There will always be challenges</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.657" end="00:06:47.119" style="s2"> what is interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.119" end="00:06:48.392" style="s2"> Inside this incomplete structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.444" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2"> Always embedded with a series of challenges</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.795" end="00:06:53.068" style="s2"> Because of its incompleteness</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.246" end="00:06:55.960" style="s2"> Maybe even because of its rotten nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.367" end="00:07:00.125" style="s2"> It is calling you to a heroic adventure</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.417" end="00:07:01.492" style="s2"> Potential answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.920" end="00:07:04.572" style="s2"> To take a heroic adventure is to fix the roadblock</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.624" end="00:07:06.200" style="s2"> Repair the city</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.423" end="00:07:09.968" style="s2"> You can always do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.989" end="00:07:13.121" style="s2"> No matter what kind of environment you are in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.298" end="00:07:14.384" style="s2"> There will always be some around you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.624" end="00:07:16.628" style="s2"> Something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.670" end="00:07:18.778" style="s2"> Things that have not been properly arranged</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.123" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2"> You can fix things if you want</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.045" end="00:07:23.037" style="s2"> We are going to talk tonight</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.037" end="00:07:26.085" style="s2"> One of the things is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.674" end="00:07:32.077" style="s2"> If you take that attitude</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.599" end="00:07:35.626" style="s2"> What you should do is make the world a better place</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.626" end="00:07:38.027" style="s2"> No matter where you are no matter what you do</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.883" end="00:07:40.375" style="s2"> In fact, after you did</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.375" end="00:07:41.764" style="s2"> The world will get better</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.764" end="00:07:44.112" style="s2"> Wherever you are in various forms</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.394" end="00:07:47.703" style="s2"> We as a race</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.703" end="00:07:49.895" style="s2"> More or as a different individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.480" end="00:07:53.058" style="s2"> Rarely realize this</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.392" end="00:07:56.743" style="s2"> It will not be used as a proposition often</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.087" end="00:07:58.350" style="s2"> This surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.624" end="00:08:01.419" style="s2"> I experienced an interesting thing one day</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.419" end="00:08:02.338" style="s2"> I went to eat at the Keg steakhouse</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.089" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2"> Because I am allergic to many foods</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:07.411" style="s2"> This restaurant treats people with food allergies very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.590" end="00:08:10.187" style="s2"> The waiter took me to my seat</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.386" end="00:08:12.620" style="s2"> He said he has been watching my lecture</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.611" end="00:08:15.334" style="s2"> I often hear this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.108" end="00:08:18.152" style="s2"> He is very happy about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.173" end="00:08:20.448" style="s2"> He said he had been in the past two months</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.448" end="00:08:21.868" style="s2"> I have been promoted twice in this restaurant</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.432" end="00:08:23.716" style="s2"> Because he watched my lecture</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.290" end="00:08:27.421" style="s2"> I really think his experience is very moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.235" end="00:08:30.762" style="s2"> You might say he is just a waiter</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.762" end="00:08:33.089" style="s2"> There is nothing special about bravery</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.342" end="00:08:35.845" style="s2"> I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.845" end="00:08:38.267" style="s2"> Because i don&#39;t care where you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.267" end="00:08:39.373" style="s2"> You can do your work to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.488" end="00:08:40.751" style="s2"> I really mean this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.839" end="00:08:44.457" style="s2"> You can accept a job</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.457" end="00:08:47.818" style="s2"> Then turn it into a complete nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.653" end="00:08:52.004" style="s2"> Or you can act like a civilized human</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.275" end="00:08:54.551" style="s2"> And realized that no matter where you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.551" end="00:08:57.056" style="s2"> There is a variety of variety on hand</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.056" end="00:08:59.989" style="s2"> Unfinished things</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.678" end="00:09:02.413" style="s2"> And you will take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.413" end="00:09:03.225" style="s2"> you can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.185" end="00:09:06.503" style="s2"> &quot;I just happened to be a waiter in this restaurant&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.139" end="00:09:08.705" style="s2"> &quot;This is not the job I expected.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.810" end="00:09:09.697" style="s2"> He is a young man</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.073" end="00:09:11.785" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe this is not where I belong.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.889" end="00:09:15.104" style="s2"> &quot;But it&#39;s not useless, it&#39;s a rich environment&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.104" end="00:09:17.442" style="s2"> &quot;I can make it much better if I want.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.453" end="00:09:19.290" style="s2"> &quot;I can get along well with my colleagues&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.311" end="00:09:20.918" style="s2"> &quot;Don&#39;t just talk about them behind their backs&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.304" end="00:09:22.912" style="s2"> &quot;I can treat my customers well&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.162" end="00:09:26.242" style="s2"> &quot;If there is a chance to show up in front of me, I will seize it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.461" end="00:09:27.964" style="s2"> &quot;I can pay attention to what is happening around me&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.457" end="00:09:31.315" style="s2"> That guy said he did that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.565" end="00:09:33.288" style="s2"> Things got better</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.288" end="00:09:36.513" style="s2"> He has a higher position than three months ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.513" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2"> How long is three months</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.663" end="00:09:40.125" style="s2"> This is a good track</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.156" end="00:09:41.357" style="s2"> Is going uphill</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.837" end="00:09:43.058" style="s2"> This is what you really want</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.496" end="00:09:45.678" style="s2"> I think an uphill road is better than</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.709" end="00:09:47.745" style="s2"> Better to be in a good situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.745" end="00:09:50.553" style="s2"> Because it can really make your life meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.553" end="00:09:53.298" style="s2"> You know soberly that you are moving towards a place</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.298" end="00:09:54.530" style="s2"> That place is better than where you are now</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.812" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2"> If you understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.192" end="00:09:59.175" style="s2"> What you are doing and your tendency to do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.175" end="00:10:02.578" style="s2"> It would be better if there is direct causality</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.225" end="00:10:05.250" style="s2"> I have received many letters like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.605" end="00:10:08.653" style="s2"> Most of them are written to me by young men, although not all</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.112" end="00:10:12.359" style="s2"> They said &quot;I have been listening to your lessons&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.359" end="00:10:15.292" style="s2"> &quot;I made up my mind to try to take the responsibility of life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.469" end="00:10:19.979" style="s2"> &quot;I stopped doing those stupid things</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.979" end="00:10:23.048" style="s2"> &quot;Those stupid things I know I shouldn&#39;t do&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.350" end="00:10:24.812" style="s2"> &quot;I started doing those</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.812" end="00:10:26.879" style="s2"> &quot;Not stupid, I know what I should do&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.993" end="00:10:28.392" style="s2"> Actually it&#39;s pretty obvious whether you should do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.413" end="00:10:29.133" style="s2"> If you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.593" end="00:10:31.670" style="s2"> But even if they are obvious</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.670" end="00:10:33.246" style="s2"> People don’t do these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.246" end="00:10:34.258" style="s2"> Then they wrote to me saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.540" end="00:10:36.691" style="s2"> &quot;You can&#39;t believe how much change this has brought me.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.098" end="00:10:38.768" style="s2"> They are very excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.768" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2"> I was also very excited when I received such a letter</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.148" end="00:10:45.094" style="s2"> I really don’t compare to receiving such a letter</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.104" end="00:10:47.306" style="s2"> Better experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.348" end="00:10:49.937" style="s2"> Because seeing the less good things replaced by better things</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.741" end="00:10:53.549" style="s2"> This is really great</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.987" end="00:10:55.824" style="s2"> I think this is an inconclusive question</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.824" end="00:10:57.776" style="s2"> I really believe this is an inconclusive question</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.476" end="00:11:00.553" style="s2"> &quot;If we are determined to do something</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.553" end="00:11:02.860" style="s2"> &quot;How far can we make them better?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.663" end="00:11:06.137" style="s2"> Some of the stories we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.492" end="00:11:08.142" style="s2"> Especially the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.434" end="00:11:10.052" style="s2"> Is the analysis of this problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.052" end="00:11:11.221" style="s2"> This is a compelling analysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.325" end="00:11:14.363" style="s2"> It appears so early in these texts</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.188" end="00:11:17.933" style="s2"> Such a basic story</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.476" end="00:11:19.227" style="s2"> It basically says</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.436" end="00:11:20.991" style="s2"> There are two modes of behavior in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.263" end="00:11:25.125" style="s2"> One is that you take it rightly</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.188" end="00:11:29.843" style="s2"> The responsibility to live</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.853" end="00:11:32.077" style="s2"> And then make the necessary sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.327" end="00:11:34.686" style="s2"> So everything can flourish</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.167" end="00:11:37.891" style="s2"> The other is the path of hatred</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.891" end="00:11:41.221" style="s2"> Painful renunciation, killing and extinction</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.221" end="00:11:43.851" style="s2"> It seems to me exactly like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.436" end="00:11:49.533" style="s2"> So if the positive way is beckoning you if you can notice it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.533" end="00:11:53.403" style="s2"> If you can really lower your head and humbly notice it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.029" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2"> Carl Jung once said</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:11:56.638" style="s2"> &quot;Modern people cannot see God</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.638" end="00:11:57.964" style="s2"> &quot;Because they refuse to condescend to look at it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.256" end="00:11:59.822" style="s2"> That&#39;s a sentence I like very much</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.699" end="00:12:01.545" style="s2"> People look down on</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.545" end="00:12:03.538" style="s2"> The opportunity that appeared before them</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.509" end="00:12:05.574" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.845" end="00:12:09.133" style="s2"> It is the majesty of being that appears before you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.175" end="00:12:10.469" style="s2"> This is what appeared in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.636" end="00:12:13.747" style="s2"> It is endlessly complex and full of potential</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.831" end="00:12:17.254" style="s2"> You have no reason to assume where you are now</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.515" end="00:12:20.156" style="s2"> As a starting point</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.939" end="00:12:23.413" style="s2"> I know some people have terrible lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.413" end="00:12:25.803" style="s2"> Their situation is completely beyond the tolerance of ordinary people</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.367" end="00:12:27.547" style="s2"> But i also know</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.547" end="00:12:28.872" style="s2"> Even in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.904" end="00:12:33.789" style="s2"> Can be made worse by your worst attitude</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.862" end="00:12:34.655" style="s2"> I am very sure of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.250" end="00:12:37.286" style="s2"> So anyway you are in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.286" end="00:12:38.486" style="s2"> You are in a damaged structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.486" end="00:12:39.791" style="s2"> You yourself are a damaged structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.791" end="00:12:40.981" style="s2"> You are in a damaged structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.641" end="00:12:44.843" style="s2"> But it still has a few walls</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.927" end="00:12:47.557" style="s2"> You are not fed to lions every day as food</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.724" end="00:12:48.643" style="s2"> This is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.509" end="00:12:54.165" style="s2"> You can rush out like a hero and magically</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.185" end="00:12:55.793" style="s2"> To face those</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:12:58.935" style="s2"> The chaos that constantly endangers your structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.935" end="00:13:01.336" style="s2"> You can free something by doing this</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.336" end="00:13:04.154" style="s2"> You can learn something to make yourself stronger</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.154" end="00:13:05.020" style="s2"> This is another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.020" end="00:13:11.565" style="s2"> Because it affects your composition</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.565" end="00:13:14.874" style="s2"> It’s what you encounter when you voluntarily face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.375" end="00:13:17.463" style="s2"> The more you voluntarily face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.463" end="00:13:18.998" style="s2"> The more you will grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.196" end="00:13:21.231" style="s2"> The more you grow, the more things you can meet</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.231" end="00:13:24.165" style="s2"> You are more and more able to face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.175" end="00:13:26.064" style="s2"> Then re-establish order</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.064" end="00:13:28.371" style="s2"> From the potential of being</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.371" end="00:13:30.553" style="s2"> Summon the right order</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.023" end="00:13:31.816" style="s2"> Gosh, do you have to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.056" end="00:13:33.778" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t you do this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.893" end="00:13:34.947" style="s2"> Even if you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.375" end="00:13:36.628" style="s2"> This is an endless mystery</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.634" end="00:13:42.129" style="s2"> To a certain extent, this truth is also covered in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.192" end="00:13:43.037" style="s2"> In the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.350" end="00:13:45.678" style="s2"> Adam became self-aware and self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.680" end="00:13:48.956" style="s2"> And feel ashamed of myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.956" end="00:13:51.555" style="s2"> He considers himself a lowly creature</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.576" end="00:13:53.465" style="s2"> People will think so for countless reasons</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.570" end="00:13:55.824" style="s2"> Because we are full of defects</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.824" end="00:13:57.693" style="s2"> So Adam avoided God</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.693" end="00:14:00.469" style="s2"> I think this is the answer to this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.762" end="00:14:05.469" style="s2"> People do not aim for the highest good</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.469" end="00:14:08.496" style="s2"> Because they are ashamed of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.227" end="00:14:11.231" style="s2"> Their weaknesses and shortcomings</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.204" end="00:14:14.436" style="s2"> This is not the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.968" end="00:14:17.484" style="s2"> There is also a desire to avoid responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.484" end="00:14:20.125" style="s2"> And also all those negative motives</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.125" end="00:14:22.797" style="s2"> Like resentment and hatred</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.797" end="00:14:24.373" style="s2"> And the expectation of making things worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.655" end="00:14:27.891" style="s2"> I don’t want everyone to think about the relaxed side</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.363" end="00:14:30.438" style="s2"> Almost like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.315" end="00:14:34.843" style="s2"> So it’s okay if you are in a not so good place</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.864" end="00:14:37.129" style="s2"> If all you want to do is put where you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.150" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2"> become better</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.110" end="00:14:40.657" style="s2"> As a clinical psychologist I know one thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.751" end="00:14:45.073" style="s2"> It’s just that you can’t believe how powerful a bit of progress can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.334" end="00:14:48.559" style="s2"> You can do a calculation like a cumulative interest rate</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.269" end="00:14:52.536" style="s2"> If you can make your life a tenth better every week</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.818" end="00:14:53.726" style="s2"> In two or three years</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.726" end="00:14:56.117" style="s2"> You can get to a much better place than you are now</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.419" end="00:14:59.405" style="s2"> Reminiscence</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.707" end="00:15:02.129" style="s2"> If you insist on ten or twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.129" end="00:15:03.371" style="s2"> Especially if you are still young</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.371" end="00:15:05.751" style="s2"> You start cheering up earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.751" end="00:15:08.016" style="s2"> Then start to solve the problems you can solve</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.423" end="00:15:12.348" style="s2"> You can transform your life incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.547" end="00:15:15.783" style="s2"> In terms of human possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.023" end="00:15:17.567" style="s2"> God knows what its upper limit is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.755" end="00:15:18.977" style="s2"> We are magical creatures</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.634" end="00:15:21.127" style="s2"> When we really cheer up</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.210" end="00:15:23.684" style="s2"> And no longer just run at our 10% capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.043" end="00:15:27.421" style="s2"> So you should do</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.444" end="00:15:30.845" style="s2"> Things are not what they should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.845" end="00:15:32.797" style="s2"> This thing at least gives you something to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.885" end="00:15:36.555" style="s2"> Maybe still something great</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.597" end="00:15:38.664" style="s2"> Because the suffering and troubles are endless</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.248" end="00:15:40.542" style="s2"> They haunt the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.542" end="00:15:44.050" style="s2"> So you can improve the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.478" end="00:15:50.292" style="s2"> The utility of this and its own meaning are self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.023" end="00:15:52.912" style="s2"> This also makes me</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.580" end="00:15:55.720" style="s2"> Curious about things like nihilism and despair</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.837" end="00:15:58.183" style="s2"> I understand these emotions</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.183" end="00:15:59.436" style="s2"> I understand them deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.436" end="00:16:01.534" style="s2"> And the mentality of intellectuals accompanying it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.534" end="00:16:04.373" style="s2"> But they are off the point to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.446" end="00:16:07.150" style="s2"> Because there are so many things to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.766" end="00:16:10.073" style="s2"> You just need to open your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.198" end="00:16:11.461" style="s2"> Look at them and decide</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.461" end="00:16:12.995" style="s2"> What will you really do</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.995" end="00:16:13.841" style="s2"> You might think</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.582" end="00:16:18.215" style="s2"> Things i can influence</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.215" end="00:16:20.188" style="s2"> Too trivial, no need to do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.208" end="00:16:22.818" style="s2"> But if you do it, it won’t always be trivial</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.434" end="00:16:23.956" style="s2"> Not at all</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.956" end="00:16:25.668" style="s2"> Besides, I didn’t think it was trivial at first</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.482" end="00:16:29.133" style="s2"> I don’t think any one thing is trivial</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.271" end="00:16:31.461" style="s2"> My life experience tells me</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.461" end="00:16:35.469" style="s2"> Everything I did pays off</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.075" end="00:16:39.707" style="s2"> It doesn’t have to be returned to me in the way I expected</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.707" end="00:16:40.939" style="s2"> This is totally different</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.336" end="00:16:44.039" style="s2"> But if you really make up your mind to do something</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.342" end="00:16:45.626" style="s2"> Even if it goes off</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.626" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2"> Its result is not what I expected</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.371" end="00:16:51.075" style="s2"> But the overall result will be good in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.359" end="00:16:57.588" style="s2"> All conquerable new areas are a step forward</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.588" end="00:16:59.499" style="s2"> New fields will never be exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.833" end="00:17:01.158" style="s2"> We are surrounded by the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.158" end="00:17:03.079" style="s2"> We are surrounded by our own ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.121" end="00:17:07.902" style="s2"> We can choose to continuously advance to the chaotic realm</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.371" end="00:17:10.918" style="s2"> Or we can reshape these pathological orders</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.941" end="00:17:14.645" style="s2"> This is the secret of legitimate being</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.083" end="00:17:17.150" style="s2"> So when you face chaos</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.327" end="00:17:19.749" style="s2"> You can think of yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.822" end="00:17:24.352" style="s2"> Individuals who have the ability to overcome chaos despite their defects</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.843" end="00:17:27.129" style="s2"> Not to mention the danger of doing this is another matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.129" end="00:17:29.092" style="s2"> Because of the fact that you are fragile</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.092" end="00:17:31.284" style="s2"> Is the premise of your heroism</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.294" end="00:17:32.568" style="s2"> Because if you are not vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.568" end="00:17:33.611" style="s2"> Then do a difficult thing itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.611" end="00:17:35.188" style="s2"> There is no bravery, is it?</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.678" end="00:17:38.058" style="s2"> If you can&#39;t be hurt or knocked down</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.382" end="00:17:40.052" style="s2"> Or end in failure</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.052" end="00:17:43.914" style="s2"> So where are these hardworking warriors?</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.457" end="00:17:48.100" style="s2"> That fragility must be deeply rooted in courage</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.071" end="00:17:51.858" style="s2"> Not a reason to escape</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.327" end="00:17:53.716" style="s2"> In fact the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.037" end="00:17:59.227" style="s2"> So what should you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.227" end="00:18:00.981" style="s2"> You integrate and revitalize the city</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.513" end="00:18:02.661" style="s2"> Maybe change back to what you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.755" end="00:18:06.294" style="s2"> So that it becomes practical, efficient and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.294" end="00:18:08.163" style="s2"> People can open branches there</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.041" end="00:18:17.223" style="s2"> It makes people feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.223" end="00:18:20.188" style="s2"> The unbearable disaster of existence itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.563" end="00:18:22.557" style="s2"> Becomes worth experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.693" end="00:18:24.165" style="s2"> That&#39;s what you should be determined to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.509" end="00:18:27.547" style="s2"> It&#39;s not impossible</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.455" end="00:18:31.565" style="s2"> Then you didn’t just repair the city</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.565" end="00:18:34.029" style="s2"> You turned yourself into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.112" end="00:18:35.929" style="s2"> Repairman who keeps repairing the city</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:38.935" style="s2"> That&#39;s even better, that&#39;s your ultimate goal</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.206" end="00:18:41.231" style="s2"> Your goal is not only to repair the city</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.231" end="00:18:44.102" style="s2"> Still have to turn yourself into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.102" end="00:18:45.939" style="s2"> A repairman who can keep repairing the city</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.716" end="00:18:50.939" style="s2"> There is no reason why this kind of thing shouldn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.463" end="00:18:53.956" style="s2"> The more such things happen, the better</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.755" end="00:19:02.829" style="s2"> There is a dark line in the story of the flood</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.829" end="00:19:06.722" style="s2"> Is the fact that the city has become corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.858" end="00:19:08.893" style="s2"> Because people don’t make heroic efforts</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.893" end="00:19:11.910" style="s2"> Or they did the opposite endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.910" end="00:19:14.634" style="s2"> Committed a completely destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.010" end="00:19:17.672" style="s2"> This is another thing worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.672" end="00:19:22.380" style="s2"> If you think about your own life</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.200" end="00:19:27.808" style="s2"> You can say to people</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.849" end="00:19:29.551" style="s2"> &quot;You have to tell the truth and be a good person&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.553" end="00:19:34.269" style="s2"> This is obviously a cliché</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.645" end="00:19:35.626" style="s2"> Also because it&#39;s a cliché</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.636" end="00:19:36.691" style="s2"> So not convincing</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.359" end="00:19:38.517" style="s2"> But you can take it apart to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.591" end="00:19:41.806" style="s2"> Practice this sentence in a less old-fashioned way</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.735" end="00:19:46.440" style="s2"> For example, you can look at this sentence more modestly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.732" end="00:19:48.309" style="s2"> Maybe you can&#39;t tell the truth because</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.350" end="00:19:49.676" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know what the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.791" end="00:19:51.503" style="s2"> But there is one thing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.503" end="00:19:53.549" style="s2"> You can stop telling lies that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.279" end="00:19:56.607" style="s2"> You might say how do I know which words are false</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.215" end="00:20:02.150" style="s2"> To answer this question requires a philosophy of truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.150" end="00:20:02.964" style="s2"> Have a long talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.382" end="00:20:05.323" style="s2"> Let’s not delve into this question</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.344" end="00:20:08.987" style="s2"> Because in a sense this is not the point we are going to talk about now</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.217" end="00:20:11.336" style="s2"> The problem is that there are always times in your life</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.336" end="00:20:13.570" style="s2"> You know what you are saying is not true</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.935" end="00:20:16.190" style="s2"> It’s a lie</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.190" end="00:20:18.653" style="s2"> You use it to manipulate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.653" end="00:20:19.948" style="s2"> Or manipulate others or the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.334" end="00:20:23.799" style="s2"> And you still think that you can retreat without being held accountable</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.238" end="00:20:26.284" style="s2"> This is demonic arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.284" end="00:20:29.092" style="s2"> In fact, this arrogant prototype is shown in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.415" end="00:20:32.004" style="s2"> In the mythical image of the devil Satan</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.035" end="00:20:36.941" style="s2"> Satan is the ones who think they can</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.181" end="00:20:42.620" style="s2"> People who distort the structure of reality without paying the price</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.620" end="00:20:44.018" style="s2"> Prototype thought element</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.227" end="00:20:46.743" style="s2"> You can&#39;t think of anything more arrogant than this</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.808" end="00:20:51.012" style="s2"> You really think you can distort the facts</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.346" end="00:20:53.131" style="s2"> Then this will bring you benefits</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.131" end="00:20:54.290" style="s2"> Won&#39;t you receive any retribution?</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.540" end="00:20:57.818" style="s2"> Everyone knows it won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.215" end="00:20:59.833" style="s2"> Back to the topic at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.501" end="00:21:01.430" style="s2"> you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.390" end="00:21:05.908" style="s2"> According to the rules of the game you are playing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.137" end="00:21:07.317" style="s2"> sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.317" end="00:21:10.574" style="s2"> You are violating those rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.847" end="00:21:13.966" style="s2"> The first thing we are talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.039" end="00:21:17.735" style="s2"> Tell the truth or take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.027" end="00:21:21.137" style="s2"> They just mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.137" end="00:21:23.705" style="s2"> Don&#39;t cheat in the game of your choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.488" end="00:21:25.553" style="s2"> This is a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.741" end="00:21:30.522" style="s2"> Then you will start to sort out your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.369" end="00:21:37.121" style="s2"> So how does the flood relate to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.144" end="00:21:39.398" style="s2"> We live in a corrupt structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.398" end="00:21:40.639" style="s2"> We are corrupt as independent individuals</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.677" end="00:21:42.169" style="s2"> We live in a corrupt structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.568" end="00:21:44.562" style="s2"> Part of the spoilage is just accident</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.677" end="00:21:45.993" style="s2"> Things just fall apart like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.993" end="00:21:46.821" style="s2"> But another part of the corruption is because</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.498" end="00:21:50.432" style="s2"> Our goals are often not positive but negative</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.347" end="00:21:54.445" style="s2"> The flood story is a very clear warning</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.445" end="00:21:57.554" style="s2"> The warning is if your goal is negative enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.420" end="00:22:01.166" style="s2"> Then there are enough people like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.996" end="00:22:05.103" style="s2"> Everything will go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.946" end="00:22:11.561" style="s2"> Like the chaos at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.561" end="00:22:12.438" style="s2"> Probably like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.667" end="00:22:18.620" style="s2"> The appearance of the universe in mythology is chaos versus order</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.971" end="00:22:21.780" style="s2"> It can be said that order is above and chaos always hides below</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.319" end="00:22:24.576" style="s2"> Chaos can burst and order can collapse</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.576" end="00:22:25.993" style="s2"> And you can plunge into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.993" end="00:22:28.815" style="s2"> Chaos is a mixed potential</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.178" end="00:22:34.520" style="s2"> The way to disrupt order and make chaos rise</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.520" end="00:22:36.802" style="s2"> As depicted in the flood story</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.912" end="00:22:42.043" style="s2"> Was parasitic on your father&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.043" end="00:22:43.536" style="s2"> This is a mythical theme</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.887" end="00:22:48.426" style="s2"> And cannibalized his body without gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.467" end="00:22:52.087" style="s2"> Never thought of compensating for what I have been asking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.940" end="00:22:57.228" style="s2"> The warning in the flood story is not to do this for long</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.228" end="00:23:00.852" style="s2"> Because things will get so bad you can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.279" end="00:23:02.695" style="s2"> That will happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.695" end="00:23:03.786" style="s2"> Will happen in your family</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.786" end="00:23:04.739" style="s2"> Also happen in your social group</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.739" end="00:23:07.435" style="s2"> This kind of thing happened to people time and time again in history</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.937" end="00:23:08.978" style="s2"> It&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.191" end="00:23:11.636" style="s2"> After the story of Cain and Abel is over</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.050" end="00:23:15.485" style="s2"> In the story of Adam and Eve, evil soon came to the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.401" end="00:23:17.692" style="s2"> And accompanied by the awakening of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.692" end="00:23:21.354" style="s2"> Evil is the knowledge of good and evil in this story</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.416" end="00:23:23.548" style="s2"> Is the ability to hurt others</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.586" end="00:23:25.542" style="s2"> Have a clear understanding of what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.968" end="00:23:29.078" style="s2"> Of course Cain immediately took this to the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.078" end="00:23:33.667" style="s2"> He destroyed his beloved with that ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.931" end="00:23:38.532" style="s2"> He did his best to destroy the divine ideal</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.532" end="00:23:41.880" style="s2"> His younger brother named Abel is favored by God</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.194" end="00:23:43.235" style="s2"> Cain destroyed him</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.623" end="00:23:46.056" style="s2"> At the end of that chapter Cain said to God</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.269" end="00:23:48.163" style="s2"> The punishment he received was beyond his capacity</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.163" end="00:23:49.128" style="s2"> I think the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.504" end="00:23:52.338" style="s2"> Once you destroy your ideals, where will you be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.078" end="00:23:54.294" style="s2"> What are you left</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.084" end="00:23:57.416" style="s2"> You can&#39;t go where there is no room for improvement</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.943" end="00:24:00.426" style="s2"> When there is no room for improvement, there will be a lot of fall</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.416" end="00:24:05.843" style="s2"> Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.843" end="00:24:09.191" style="s2"> When describing the nature of hell from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.768" end="00:24:11.887" style="s2"> Came up with a very good idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.169" end="00:24:16.727" style="s2"> Your depth in hell is your distance from the &quot;good&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.517" end="00:24:19.335" style="s2"> This way of understanding is also very good</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.275" end="00:24:21.805" style="s2"> If you destroy your own ideals</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.181" end="00:24:24.112" style="s2"> With jealousy and resentment</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.589" end="00:24:28.213" style="s2"> With the desire to defeat the person you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.539" end="00:24:32.050" style="s2"> You will fall into a situation no different from hell</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.827" end="00:24:37.040" style="s2"> The story of the Bible is unfolded by Cain</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.943" end="00:24:38.721" style="s2"> Then the flood</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.874" end="00:24:43.987" style="s2"> Cain adopted a way of being that is opposed to being itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.987" end="00:24:45.116" style="s2"> At least as opposed to being positive</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.116" end="00:24:46.106" style="s2"> He did it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.106" end="00:24:48.827" style="s2"> Fully aware of what you are doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.354" end="00:24:50.946" style="s2"> When this way of being affects the entire social structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.072" end="00:24:53.893" style="s2"> The end result is</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.257" end="00:24:56.300" style="s2"> God stepped back and said</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.526" end="00:24:57.667" style="s2"> &quot;The whole thing got so bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.667" end="00:24:59.949" style="s2"> &quot;All we can do is destroy this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.241" end="00:25:05.141" style="s2"> This is not a joke, this is how things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.880" end="00:25:08.200" style="s2"> In this series of stories</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.200" end="00:25:09.630" style="s2"> There is a very scary thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.630" end="00:25:10.884" style="s2"> And I believe in its authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.884" end="00:25:15.561" style="s2"> I am independent of my analysis of myths</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.561" end="00:25:17.191" style="s2"> Aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.793" end="00:25:21.517" style="s2"> I checked China under Mao Zedong in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.755" end="00:25:22.821" style="s2"> And what happened in places like Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.285" end="00:25:26.658" style="s2"> Those who have the most keen insight into these societies</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.708" end="00:25:28.539" style="s2"> How those absolute disasters happened</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.827" end="00:25:32.200" style="s2"> Those who are most interested</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.576" end="00:25:34.006" style="s2"> All said the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.147" end="00:25:38.595" style="s2"> It is rooted in the degeneration of the individuals that make up this society</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.297" end="00:25:41.830" style="s2"> You hear them say &quot;people just obey orders&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.094" end="00:25:44.351" style="s2"> No, this explanation is simply not tenable</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.664" end="00:25:46.420" style="s2"> &quot;If people resist, they will be punished.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.457" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2"> This is a bit true</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:49.542" style="s2"> But not as good as people might think</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.542" end="00:25:51.435" style="s2"> Especially at the beginning of the process</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.949" end="00:25:53.956" style="s2"> It&#39;s more people&#39;s decision</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.956" end="00:25:55.247" style="s2"> Each of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.247" end="00:25:58.796" style="s2"> Turn a blind eye to disasters and participate in lies</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.611" end="00:26:01.103" style="s2"> This distorts the whole society</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.103" end="00:26:05.492" style="s2"> They turned towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.492" end="00:26:08.614" style="s2"> The closest place you can think of to hell</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.614" end="00:26:10.793" style="s2"> Especially in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.009" end="00:26:12.551" style="s2"> Including the above three places</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.028" end="00:26:15.347" style="s2"> Like the Chinese Soviet Union in the Mao era</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.805" end="00:26:20.965" style="s2"> The scary thing in &quot;Genesis&quot; is</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.266" end="00:26:23.272" style="s2"> They speak very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.175" end="00:26:27.648" style="s2"> Your moral degradation will largely lead to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.673" end="00:26:30.244" style="s2"> Degeneration of the entire universe</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.435" end="00:26:35.097" style="s2"> You would say i want my life to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.159" end="00:26:36.940" style="s2"> People say that, but is that true?</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.940" end="00:26:39.899" style="s2"> Do you really want to make your life meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.899" end="00:26:41.868" style="s2"> You think people will use a bit of nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.868" end="00:26:44.137" style="s2"> To escape that special realization</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.137" end="00:26:45.667" style="s2"> I think people have always done this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.081" end="00:26:49.404" style="s2"> Recognize that it is too heavy</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.868" end="00:26:51.786" style="s2"> But we are connected</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.012" end="00:26:59.849" style="s2"> This is the weakness caused by our strong communication skills</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.291" end="00:27:08.564" style="s2"> Of course the chain reaction of our personal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.564" end="00:27:12.288" style="s2"> May be far beyond the limits of our current consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.614" end="00:27:14.319" style="s2"> I think people know this too</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.896" end="00:27:17.492" style="s2"> They are a kind of &quot;I know</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.667" end="00:27:18.984" style="s2"> &quot;But I don’t want to realize that I know.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.686" end="00:27:21.191" style="s2"> In other words, people know their specific manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.191" end="00:27:23.059" style="s2"> People can feel them</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.059" end="00:27:24.551" style="s2"> People have emotional reactions to these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.727" end="00:27:27.310" style="s2"> But refused to make them clear</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.310" end="00:27:28.626" style="s2"> Because they don&#39;t want to know</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.554" end="00:27:31.147" style="s2"> When you do or haven’t done things to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.147" end="00:27:32.652" style="s2"> When feeling guilty and ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.965" end="00:27:34.934" style="s2"> I know this can become uncontrollable</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.322" end="00:27:38.031" style="s2"> This is usually because you have a small distorted self</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.294" end="00:27:40.877" style="s2"> Want the worst result</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.605" end="00:27:44.062" style="s2"> One thing Jung said about shadows is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.401" end="00:27:47.059" style="s2"> That’s Jung’s famous theory that everyone has a dark side</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.297" end="00:27:50.006" style="s2"> And the dark side needs to be integrated and aware</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.915" end="00:27:56.677" style="s2"> The dark side of humanity will spread all the way to hell</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.993" end="00:28:01.166" style="s2"> This is the interesting thing about reading Jung&#39;s works</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.442" end="00:28:02.984" style="s2"> He said exactly what he meant</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.435" end="00:28:04.501" style="s2"> This is not a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.495" end="00:28:10.658" style="s2"> Partly twisted to oppose beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.783" end="00:28:14.382" style="s2"> Is consistent with part of the conscious universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.708" end="00:28:18.470" style="s2"> Your goal is to make everything as bad as possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.373" end="00:28:21.579" style="s2"> Realizing this can be very shocking</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.579" end="00:28:23.247" style="s2"> This is part of the reason why people don’t want to realize it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.623" end="00:28:26.695" style="s2"> People will keep a certain distance from it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.846" end="00:28:31.210" style="s2"> It’s like admitting to be a guard of a Nazi concentration camp</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.210" end="00:28:32.865" style="s2"> This exercise is very useful</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.366" end="00:28:35.410" style="s2"> It&#39;s entirely possible that you used to be such a guard</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.125" end="00:28:38.394" style="s2"> And most likely you are still</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.949" end="00:28:41.141" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.445" end="00:28:44.050" style="s2"> Then there is more reason to assume</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.062" end="00:28:48.300" style="s2"> You are powerless to resist when temptation really comes to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.300" end="00:28:49.868" style="s2"> If you don’t think guarding this position is a temptation</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.144" end="00:28:54.043" style="s2"> Then you really don&#39;t understand human nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.043" end="00:28:55.962" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t even touch the door</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.363" end="00:28:57.504" style="s2"> If this is not a temptation</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.504" end="00:28:59.435" style="s2"> There won&#39;t be so many people doing this</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.962" end="00:29:02.056" style="s2"> And many people have done this, nothing new</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.037" end="00:29:10.783" style="s2"> The seriousness of the story of &quot;Genesis&quot; develops very, very fast</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.175" end="00:29:15.874" style="s2"> Serious depth is the ultimate prototype</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.175" end="00:29:18.457" style="s2"> How serious you can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.570" end="00:29:28.388" style="s2"> The story of Noah and the Flood unfolds in a fragmented way</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.388" end="00:29:32.514" style="s2"> I believe these clips are part of a longer story</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.990" end="00:29:34.583" style="s2"> And we only have fragments of this long story</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.664" end="00:29:41.918" style="s2"> And this long story is also part of other stories</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.269" end="00:29:43.824" style="s2"> This is how the story begins</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.974" end="00:29:46.946" style="s2"> &quot;When there are more people in the world,</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.946" end="00:29:49.191" style="s2"> &quot;When the daughter was born again&quot; (Genesis 6:1)</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.191" end="00:29:53.742" style="s2"> &quot;The sons of God see the beauty of human women</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.742" end="00:29:56.589" style="s2"> &quot;Just choose and marry as your wife&quot; (Genesis 6:2)</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.865" end="00:30:00.877" style="s2"> There are two ways of looking at the past</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.971" end="00:30:06.558" style="s2"> You can see this in our political environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.072" end="00:30:09.166" style="s2"> On the more conservative end of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.404" end="00:30:11.811" style="s2"> People think the past is the place of great people</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.125" end="00:30:14.282" style="s2"> Heroes of the past</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.420" end="00:30:17.040" style="s2"> Created our current environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.893" end="00:30:21.943" style="s2"> The left may be more concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.820" end="00:30:26.833" style="s2"> Corruption that has lasted for centuries</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.971" end="00:30:29.404" style="s2"> Both views are correct</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.404" end="00:30:33.943" style="s2"> You can say that there were many great heroes in the past</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.956" end="00:30:35.648" style="s2"> They established our model of being</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.648" end="00:30:38.557" style="s2"> You can imagine the two as compound creatures if you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.557" end="00:30:40.338" style="s2"> This is a very reasonable way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.216" end="00:30:45.529" style="s2"> You can also think about the centuries</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.529" end="00:30:47.373" style="s2"> The accumulation of corruption and evil</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.749" end="00:30:50.369" style="s2"> Both views are reflected in these lines of Scripture</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.122" end="00:30:53.253" style="s2"> &quot;The sons of God (the heroes)</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.517" end="00:30:55.172" style="s2"> &quot;Women who see people are beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.172" end="00:30:57.630" style="s2"> &quot;Just choose and marry as your wife&quot; (Genesis 6:2)</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.235" end="00:31:05.793" style="s2"> Then this statement is a bit illogical</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.094" end="00:31:06.783" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord says</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.821" end="00:31:08.877" style="s2"> &quot;Man is natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.115" end="00:31:10.294" style="s2"> &quot;My spirit will not live in him forever</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.783" end="00:31:12.739" style="s2"> &quot;However, his life can reach one hundred and twenty years&quot; (Gen 6:3)</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.316" end="00:31:16.413" style="s2"> I studied various interpretations of this section</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.413" end="00:31:19.573" style="s2"> Because it doesn’t seem to be clearly connected to the previous section</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.912" end="00:31:22.445" style="s2"> Its exact meaning is not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.166" end="00:31:27.561" style="s2"> The first line is about the heroes of the past</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.614" end="00:31:32.075" style="s2"> The second line means slow</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.075" end="00:31:34.457" style="s2"> The way of human existence is corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.611" end="00:31:38.695" style="s2"> As far as God is concerned, one of the consequences of this situation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.708" end="00:31:41.705" style="s2"> In some cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.257" end="00:31:45.918" style="s2"> The divine spirit will not fight against humans</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.918" end="00:31:48.890" style="s2"> This means that in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.905" end="00:31:54.407" style="s2"> Let me put it this way I think there is no better explanation than this</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.796" end="00:31:57.442" style="s2"> This means the divine impulse for good</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.006" end="00:31:59.172" style="s2"> Will leave you because of what you have done</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.940" end="00:32:02.921" style="s2"> The second thing to consider is</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.025" end="00:32:06.407" style="s2"> Maybe due to human degradation</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.407" end="00:32:09.115" style="s2"> The limited life span is not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.115" end="00:32:14.269" style="s2"> Our spirit only exists for a limited time</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.846" end="00:32:16.551" style="s2"> It in a strange way</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.877" end="00:32:19.561" style="s2"> Intertwined with human moral guilt</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:22.934" style="s2"> This is contrary to the concept of great men in the past</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.297" end="00:32:27.998" style="s2"> Then the story goes back to the point of view of the great man</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.338" end="00:32:30.645" style="s2"> &quot;At that time there were great men on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.871" end="00:32:32.614" style="s2"> &quot;Later the sons of God</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.614" end="00:32:35.423" style="s2"> &quot;Women who have sex with men have children</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.774" end="00:32:39.648" style="s2"> &quot;That is the famous person of ancient heroism&quot; (Genesis 6:4)</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.291" end="00:32:46.733" style="s2"> This is the end of the sequence fragment is very fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.984" end="00:32:50.031" style="s2"> But you can see that there are two narratives behind this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.087" style="s2"> One of them is like this</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.125" end="00:33:00.150" style="s2"> Corruption is always lurking</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.300" end="00:33:02.257" style="s2"> Even the nature of the great men of the past is the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.808" end="00:33:09.040" style="s2"> This led to God’s refusal to show grace and the fall of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.858" end="00:33:13.028" style="s2"> Pave the way for the story of Noah and the flood</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.746" end="00:33:17.278" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.304" end="00:33:22.357" style="s2"> &quot;Everything you think about all day is evil&quot; (Genesis 6:5)</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.420" end="00:33:29.416" style="s2"> When I was a child, I really didn&#39;t like going to church</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.931" end="00:33:31.222" style="s2"> I went to a very gentle church</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.222" end="00:33:32.288" style="s2"> It is a united church</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.601" end="00:33:34.445" style="s2"> It’s not even a church now</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.445" end="00:33:37.153" style="s2"> It can be said to be too mild</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.059" end="00:33:40.238" style="s2"> One of the reasons I don’t like</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.238" end="00:33:46.633" style="s2"> The pastor was chattering about the sinful nature of man</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.862" end="00:33:49.442" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.442" end="00:33:51.373" style="s2"> Partly because i don&#39;t understand the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.927" end="00:34:00.978" style="s2"> Partly because of its self-flagellation</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.978" end="00:34:02.921" style="s2"> Seems unattractive</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.072" end="00:34:05.981" style="s2"> I don’t know if there are any ways to make self-flagellation attractive</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.426" end="00:34:12.865" style="s2"> There are some mechanical and fake things that I don’t like</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.266" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2"> I did more thinking in the following years</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:18.219" style="s2"> I started to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.620" end="00:34:21.843" style="s2"> Let people take the evil</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.018" end="00:34:27.448" style="s2"> Clearly and consciously</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.899" end="00:34:29.642" style="s2"> Putting it at the forefront of imagination has practical meaning</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.068" end="00:34:33.918" style="s2"> I think I mentioned it to you last week</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.968" end="00:34:37.492" style="s2"> A short section of Mesopotamian culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.492" end="00:34:39.999" style="s2"> It’s about the emperor and the traditions of the New Year holiday</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.476" end="00:34:46.482" style="s2"> People would take the emperor out of the city wall and strip off his dragon suit</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.808" end="00:34:49.366" style="s2"> Make him an ordinary person</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.818" end="00:34:51.598" style="s2"> Then people will humiliate him in the ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.598" end="00:34:54.984" style="s2"> Questioned him what happened in the past year</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.260" end="00:34:58.846" style="s2"> Why haven&#39;t you become the majestic incarnation of Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.984" end="00:35:00.840" style="s2"> Marduk is the god of Mesopotamia</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.840" end="00:35:03.059" style="s2"> He created order from chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.310" end="00:35:04.953" style="s2"> The emperor should sit down and think</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.953" end="00:35:08.815" style="s2"> &quot;Well, I am an emperor, I should behave well.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.815" end="00:35:10.520" style="s2"> &quot;You have to perform well.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.109" end="00:35:13.504" style="s2"> &quot;But it&#39;s likely that I lack in many aspects</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.517" end="00:35:14.946" style="s2"> &quot;The missing part happens to be very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.946" end="00:35:16.927" style="s2"> &quot;Because I&#39;m starring in this whole ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.178" end="00:35:19.974" style="s2"> &quot;I should be very, very clear</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.451" end="00:35:23.297" style="s2"> &quot;How did I fail my ideals&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.561" end="00:35:26.670" style="s2"> I want to say that in institutionalized Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.946" end="00:35:30.094" style="s2"> This is a horn that is constantly degrading</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.257" end="00:35:31.573" style="s2"> That’s actually the Christian view</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.087" end="00:35:33.053" style="s2"> There are thousands of ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.053" end="00:35:35.009" style="s2"> Stop you from being everything you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.062" end="00:35:39.235" style="s2"> It shouldn&#39;t be a whip to knock you down</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.398" end="00:35:42.131" style="s2"> Although it might have whipped your pride</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.131" end="00:35:44.890" style="s2"> The pride that prevents you from seeing your shortcomings</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.203" end="00:35:48.188" style="s2"> It&#39;s more like a horn to the opposite side</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.225" end="00:35:50.482" style="s2"> It&#39;s like saying it&#39;s enough to stop</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.482" end="00:35:52.752" style="s2"> You can do better than now</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.752" end="00:35:55.159" style="s2"> It will be of great benefit to you and to others</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.185" end="00:36:01.191" style="s2"> But it won’t be good if you continue to break your own rules</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.090" end="00:36:04.718" style="s2"> Because as I said</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.718" end="00:36:06.232" style="s2"> If you start playing this game</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.232" end="00:36:08.653" style="s2"> You should at least follow the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.825" end="00:36:13.267" style="s2"> If you observe yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.645" end="00:36:16.127" style="s2"> It&#39;s a little scary</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.138" end="00:36:17.265" style="s2"> But if you pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.996" end="00:36:20.230" style="s2"> I will find myself lying</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.866" end="00:36:23.267" style="s2"> I was in my 20s when I first realized this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.603" end="00:36:27.234" style="s2"> I am a smart person and I was very proud of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.539" end="00:36:30.125" style="s2"> I was also a small man back then</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.397" end="00:36:32.870" style="s2"> The seat was adjusted forward when going to school</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.424" end="00:36:36.294" style="s2"> I was not tall when I enrolled</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.294" end="00:36:39.133" style="s2"> So I am very short in the class</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.666" end="00:36:40.689" style="s2"> I am also very talkative</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.845" end="00:36:42.891" style="s2"> At this point, everyone may be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.131" end="00:36:44.415" style="s2"> I&#39;m still a bit provocative</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.668" end="00:36:47.244" style="s2"> So I am often bullied</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.244" end="00:36:48.747" style="s2"> After all, no one is immune</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.768" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2"> My weapon is to talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.031" end="00:36:52.954" style="s2"> This is a very effective weapon although it can backfire</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.954" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2"> Because you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.050" end="00:36:58.465" style="s2"> If you talk so much to a rough big man</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.465" end="00:37:02.046" style="s2"> They will probably start heavy manual roughing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.557" end="00:37:04.624" style="s2"> That kind of thing often happens to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.710" end="00:37:12.599" style="s2"> But I am very proud that I have some intellectual advantages</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.618" end="00:37:18.184" style="s2"> At that time when I was in my 20s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.184" end="00:37:20.386" style="s2"> I started to realize the danger</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.085" end="00:37:24.019" style="s2"> I started reading &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by Milton</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.019" end="00:37:28.831" style="s2"> And began to understand the dangers of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.831" end="00:37:30.971" style="s2"> In my opinion, the danger of intelligence lies in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.971" end="00:37:33.319" style="s2"> It can easily lead to arrogance and arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.653" end="00:37:36.065" style="s2"> It’s easy to be obsessed with your own creations</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.555" end="00:37:37.964" style="s2"> In fact that is Lucifer</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.964" end="00:37:40.063" style="s2"> In &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; that is Lucifer</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.063" end="00:37:41.294" style="s2"> Lucifer is brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.305" end="00:37:42.985" style="s2"> He is obsessed with his creation</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.319" end="00:37:46.701" style="s2"> I think there is nothing outside of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.025" end="00:37:49.123" style="s2"> This is a totalitarian mentality, isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.864" end="00:37:51.075" style="s2"> &quot;We have an overall system</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.075" end="00:37:52.850" style="s2"> &quot;Know how everything works&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.069" end="00:37:53.925" style="s2"> &quot;We will implement</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.925" end="00:37:55.584" style="s2"> &quot;So paradise on earth is realized&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.557" end="00:37:59.113" style="s2"> This is a totalitarian mentality</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.144" end="00:38:02.672" style="s2"> Related to intellectual arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.159" end="00:38:08.956" style="s2"> Then another thing happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.977" end="00:38:10.230" style="s2"> I noticed this problem myself</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.230" end="00:38:12.317" style="s2"> And start to understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.330" end="00:38:14.447" style="s2"> I also started to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.447" end="00:38:16.816" style="s2"> There are other things in life besides intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:17.651" style="s2"> Too much</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.695" end="00:38:20.073" style="s2"> I was crazy about smoking and drinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.094" end="00:38:21.566" style="s2"> The weight is almost 60 kg</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.566" end="00:38:22.964" style="s2"> My body is not that good</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.904" end="00:38:26.524" style="s2"> I had a lot of things to do when I was a graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.524" end="00:38:27.568" style="s2"> Come to cheer yourself up</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.829" end="00:38:29.749" style="s2"> At the same time I tried to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.303" end="00:38:32.651" style="s2"> Why is the world wrong like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.539" end="00:38:35.344" style="s2"> This can be seen in the epitome of the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.647" end="00:38:37.317" style="s2"> And what role will i play in it</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.390" end="00:38:37.912" style="s2"> If there is any role</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.058" end="00:38:39.614" style="s2"> What role will each of us play in it</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.518" end="00:38:48.779" style="s2"> I didn’t work long in a prison at that time</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.092" end="00:38:51.012" style="s2"> I work with a crazy psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.184" end="00:38:55.992" style="s2"> He often adds jokes to multiple choice tests</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.816" end="00:38:58.351" style="s2"> He is a very weird guy</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.351" end="00:39:00.209" style="s2"> But i like his class very much</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.117" end="00:39:02.735" style="s2"> He taught a course on &quot;creativity&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.735" end="00:39:04.645" style="s2"> Also a prison psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.010" end="00:39:06.284" style="s2"> He is a weird guy</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.618" end="00:39:07.850" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know why he favors me</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.027" end="00:39:09.582" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m also weird</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.010" end="00:39:10.992" style="s2"> He invited me many times</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.117" end="00:39:13.612" style="s2"> Go with him to the highest security prison in Edmonton</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.612" end="00:39:14.394" style="s2"> I went</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.760" end="00:39:16.326" style="s2"> It was a very interesting experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.326" end="00:39:17.589" style="s2"> Because i want to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.023" end="00:39:24.269" style="s2"> Individual behavior for the group</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.937" end="00:39:27.056" style="s2"> What is the role of the abnormal state</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.213" end="00:39:28.163" style="s2"> Reasons like this</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.697" end="00:39:34.353" style="s2"> I went and met a little guy shorter than me</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.457" end="00:39:35.543" style="s2"> I grew taller then</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.096" end="00:39:37.818" style="s2"> He is a pretty harmless guy</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.572" end="00:39:42.296" style="s2"> Then I came to the gym</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.672" end="00:39:44.207" style="s2"> The prison looks like a high school</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.207" end="00:39:46.367" style="s2"> It looks really like to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:49.843" style="s2"> There are all heavy lifting guys</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.355" end="00:39:50.950" style="s2"> Everyone is wicked</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.085" end="00:39:52.902" style="s2"> I remember someone with tattoos all over</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.902" end="00:39:55.334" style="s2"> There is a huge scar in the middle of the chest</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.355" end="00:39:57.161" style="s2"> Looks like someone was injured with an axe</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.029" end="00:40:01.409" style="s2"> I stood there in the weird cloak that I often wear</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.409" end="00:40:03.779" style="s2"> I bought it in Portugal and paired it with boots</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:09.791" style="s2"> Like the cloak of Sherlock Holmes in the 1890s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.791" end="00:40:11.837" style="s2"> It really looks like the clothing of the 1890s</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.837" end="00:40:13.998" style="s2"> Because the small village is on the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.394" end="00:40:16.837" style="s2"> Surrounded by city wall villagers selling these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.848" end="00:40:19.332" style="s2"> I think they haven’t changed the style since the end of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.342" end="00:40:20.741" style="s2"> So i think it&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.741" end="00:40:21.701" style="s2"> I just wore it like this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.701" end="00:40:29.739" style="s2"> This may not be the most conservative dress</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.739" end="00:40:32.683" style="s2"> If you are going to the highest security prison</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.683" end="00:40:34.739" style="s2"> I&#39;m in the gym anyway</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.104" end="00:40:37.610" style="s2"> The psychologist left</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.037" end="00:40:40.407" style="s2"> God knows what&#39;s going on, he&#39;s such a weird person</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.866" end="00:40:43.925" style="s2"> Everyone gathered around</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.676" end="00:40:47.870" style="s2"> They want to exchange my prison clothes for my cloak</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.764" end="00:40:53.977" style="s2"> I can hardly refuse this request</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.415" end="00:40:55.971" style="s2"> I really don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.023" end="00:40:58.236" style="s2"> Then this little guy spoke</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.528" end="00:41:01.576" style="s2"> He said the psychologist asked me to take you away</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.952" end="00:41:02.818" style="s2"> Similar words</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.194" end="00:41:04.708" style="s2"> I just thought &quot;Okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.718" end="00:41:08.403" style="s2"> &quot;This little guy is better than those big guys.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.768" end="00:41:10.647" style="s2"> We walked out of the gym</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.848" end="00:41:16.660" style="s2"> Go through a few &quot;school gates&quot; to the playground</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.463" end="00:41:19.217" style="s2"> We wandered around and he started chatting with me</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.238" end="00:41:20.866" style="s2"> He looks like a harmless guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.294" end="00:41:23.100" style="s2"> Then the psychologist appeared at the door</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.100" end="00:41:24.311" style="s2"> Motion us to go back</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.376" end="00:41:26.472" style="s2"> It&#39;s a relief</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.516" end="00:41:28.612" style="s2"> I walked into his office</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.612" end="00:41:31.012" style="s2"> He said, &quot;Do you know the man who walked with you on the playground?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.012" end="00:41:31.827" style="s2"> I said yes&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.827" end="00:41:35.751" style="s2"> He said, &quot;One night, that man kidnapped two policemen.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.751" end="00:41:37.088" style="s2"> &quot;Let them kneel down&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.088" end="00:41:38.862" style="s2"> &quot;The two beg him to make a living.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.862" end="00:41:40.532" style="s2"> &quot;He shot the back of the two heads.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.357" end="00:41:45.021" style="s2"> I thought &quot;good guy&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.161" end="00:41:48.758" style="s2"> You see, the interesting thing about this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.758" end="00:41:50.042" style="s2"> He looks pretty harmless, right</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.159" end="00:41:53.048" style="s2"> You think someone like him would do this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.048" end="00:41:55.647" style="s2"> Let&#39;s put it this way, it must be completely different from you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.033" end="00:41:58.935" style="s2"> Certainly not a harmless looking guy</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.935" end="00:42:01.075" style="s2"> Do you think that person would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.284" end="00:42:03.549" style="s2"> Half-werewolf and half-vampire look</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.559" end="00:42:06.284" style="s2"> Then you immediately know that he is a cold-blooded killer</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.607" end="00:42:06.973" style="s2"> but not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.973" end="00:42:10.031" style="s2"> He is such an insignificant little person</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.564" end="00:42:11.858" style="s2"> But if you give him a revolver</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.858" end="00:42:13.862" style="s2"> Of course he is not so harmless</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.002" end="00:42:18.967" style="s2"> I thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.967" end="00:42:22.495" style="s2"> What is the relationship between harmless and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.184" end="00:42:24.113" style="s2"> Then something happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.113" end="00:42:25.209" style="s2"> I met another person there</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.555" end="00:42:27.244" style="s2"> In a week or two</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.244" end="00:42:31.033" style="s2"> I heard he and his friend caught the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.649" end="00:42:34.833" style="s2"> Smashed the man&#39;s left leg with a lead pipe</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.543" end="00:42:37.735" style="s2"> Just like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.870" end="00:42:40.459" style="s2"> They did it because they thought that man was an informer</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.553" end="00:42:41.597" style="s2"> Maybe he really is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.507" end="00:42:45.125" style="s2"> My reaction was different that time</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.167" end="00:42:47.328" style="s2"> I was not just shocked or frightened</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.328" end="00:42:48.330" style="s2"> Although I was really scared</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.695" end="00:42:51.670" style="s2"> What I think is how can you do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.670" end="00:42:53.090" style="s2"> Because I don&#39;t think I can do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.582" end="00:42:56.785" style="s2"> I think myself and those people</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.785" end="00:42:59.081" style="s2"> There are essential differences</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.052" end="00:43:03.549" style="s2"> So I spent two weeks trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.530" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2"> Under what conditions would i do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.952" end="00:43:10.334" style="s2"> What kind of psychological change do I experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.491" end="00:43:11.357" style="s2"> To do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.150" end="00:43:14.269" style="s2"> It can be said that it is a kind of meditation training</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.520" end="00:43:17.495" style="s2"> After only ten days I found out</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.225" end="00:43:19.332" style="s2"> I can not only do</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.332" end="00:43:21.482" style="s2"> And it&#39;s much easier than I expected</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.088" end="00:43:23.967" style="s2"> I&#39;ve been here since</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.967" end="00:43:25.751" style="s2"> And the wall between the &quot;shadow&quot; described by Jung</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.939" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2"> Began to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.985" end="00:43:29.812" style="s2"> That&#39;s also useful</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.812" end="00:43:34.666" style="s2"> Because I started to treat myself as a different individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.666" end="00:43:36.461" style="s2"> Because I didn’t realize it before</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.015" end="00:43:38.173" style="s2"> I thought I was a good person</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.559" end="00:43:40.355" style="s2"> Naturally, there is no reason to think badly about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.877" end="00:43:41.701" style="s2"> Unless you really do your best to be a good person</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.701" end="00:43:43.946" style="s2"> Otherwise you are not a good person</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.019" end="00:43:45.971" style="s2"> Really not being a good person is never easy</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.367" end="00:43:48.841" style="s2"> So you might just be a less bad person</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.175" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2"> Far from being a terrible person</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.246" end="00:43:55.365" style="s2"> Far from being a good person</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.939" end="00:43:58.142" style="s2"> But after that I have a little more respect for myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.194" end="00:44:00.094" style="s2"> Because i also understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.326" end="00:44:03.810" style="s2"> There are some terrible elements in the human mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.810" end="00:44:07.056" style="s2"> You have to respect this</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.735" end="00:44:09.321" style="s2"> That&#39;s a part of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.321" end="00:44:12.276" style="s2"> To some extent you have to see yourself as a loaded weapon</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.463" end="00:44:14.040" style="s2"> When getting along with children</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:15.898" style="s2"> It&#39;s very useful to see yourself as a loaded weapon</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.898" end="00:44:17.777" style="s2"> Because you are a loaded weapon in front of the child</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.768" end="00:44:22.202" style="s2"> Many children have terrible experiences when they are with their parents</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.202" end="00:44:23.184" style="s2"> Can confirm this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.169" end="00:44:28.862" style="s2"> Anyway, I started to change a bit since then</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.916" end="00:44:32.745" style="s2"> I really don&#39;t know the causality of these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.664" end="00:44:35.752" style="s2"> I guess it’s because I was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:40.647" style="s2"> Who am i and how to fix this like these</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.326" end="00:44:45.073" style="s2"> I started paying very close attention to what I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.033" end="00:44:48.330" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if this happened intentionally or unintentionally</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.330" end="00:44:51.357" style="s2"> But I can feel my heart &quot;split&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.286" end="00:44:53.549" style="s2"> Some students told me</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.549" end="00:44:55.292" style="s2"> They have encountered the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.783" end="00:44:58.873" style="s2"> It happened after they heard some of my course materials</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.332" end="00:45:01.106" style="s2"> I have talked about the information</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.743" end="00:45:06.023" style="s2"> I split into two so you can say</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.848" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2"> One is the old one I keep talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.215" end="00:45:15.532" style="s2"> Like arguing like all kinds of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.929" end="00:45:18.633" style="s2"> The other part is watching</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.332" end="00:45:22.871" style="s2"> I just opened my eyes and looked at it neutrally</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.758" end="00:45:25.511" style="s2"> The me who looked at me neutrally</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.835" end="00:45:27.328" style="s2"> Observing the me who speaks</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.328" end="00:45:29.854" style="s2"> Seems to be saying &quot;that&#39;s not your idea&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.762" end="00:45:32.317" style="s2"> &quot;You don&#39;t really believe it&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.735" end="00:45:34.666" style="s2"> &quot;You don&#39;t understand what you are talking about&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.063" end="00:45:36.159" style="s2"> &quot;that is not true&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.025" end="00:45:38.779" style="s2"> I thought to myself, &quot;Hoh, that&#39;s so funny&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.332" end="00:45:41.868" style="s2"> I think so 95% of the time when I speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.129" end="00:45:43.445" style="s2"> Then I really don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.445" end="00:45:44.927" style="s2"> I thought to myself &quot;Okay, this is weird&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.313" end="00:45:48.601" style="s2"> Maybe I split it&#39;s not a good thing at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.499" end="00:45:51.743" style="s2"> It’s not that I have auditory hallucinations or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.234" end="00:45:53.058" style="s2"> Not like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.553" end="00:45:57.797" style="s2"> Put it this way, people have many faces</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.674" end="00:46:00.584" style="s2"> So I encountered this strange puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.388" end="00:46:03.403" style="s2"> Which of the two is me</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.186" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2"> It’s the one who always listens and speaks</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.451" end="00:46:09.478" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s rubbish, it&#39;s a lie&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.386" end="00:46:12.192" style="s2"> &quot;You did that to get people&#39;s attention.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.192" end="00:46:13.737" style="s2"> &quot;You just want to win the debate&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.760" end="00:46:15.376" style="s2"> Is that me</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.376" end="00:46:19.248" style="s2"> Or it’s me who talks normally</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.843" end="00:46:22.286" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know but i decided i want to be the critic</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.651" end="00:46:24.541" style="s2"> Then I tried my best to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.541" end="00:46:25.898" style="s2"> Or learn to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.701" end="00:46:29.582" style="s2"> Stop saying those things that make me look vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.889" end="00:46:33.225" style="s2"> I mean I&#39;m still trying to do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.309" end="00:46:35.303" style="s2"> Because I always feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.303" end="00:46:38.726" style="s2"> No matter what I say when I speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.737" end="00:46:40.303" style="s2"> Those words are either helping me find my position</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.303" end="00:46:41.816" style="s2"> Or it&#39;s breaking me up</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.820" end="00:46:45.313" style="s2"> I do think &quot;calibration&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.522" end="00:46:48.038" style="s2"> Is a suitable concept to express it</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.038" end="00:46:53.006" style="s2"> Because if you express something as honestly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.747" end="00:46:58.309" style="s2"> Then they are produced from deep in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:00.219" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know where the ideas come from</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.219" end="00:47:00.626" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.626" end="00:47:04.050" style="s2"> The idea is to emerge from how deep in your underlying structure</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.050" end="00:47:06.973" style="s2"> We don’t know what kind of physical calibration you have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.973" end="00:47:10.459" style="s2"> To speak from the heart</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.668" end="00:47:11.806" style="s2"> We don&#39;t understand at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.806" end="00:47:13.090" style="s2"> We can&#39;t even conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.090" end="00:47:14.603" style="s2"> But i believe you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.864" end="00:47:17.067" style="s2"> I learned something from Carl Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.067" end="00:47:18.100" style="s2"> He is an amazing clinician</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.956" end="00:47:20.762" style="s2"> He thinks mental health</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.762" end="00:47:26.232" style="s2"> Partly spiritual or abstract</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.232" end="00:47:28.455" style="s2"> And the body are aligned with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.468" end="00:47:31.106" style="s2"> In psychoanalysis and clinical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.106" end="00:47:33.048" style="s2"> There are many thoughts about calibration</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.873" end="00:47:37.432" style="s2"> But anyway I decided to start practicing</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.735" end="00:47:39.864" style="s2"> Don&#39;t say the things that make me look weak</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.292" end="00:47:41.347" style="s2"> The result is</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.357" end="00:47:44.812" style="s2"> I can&#39;t say almost everything I have said</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.292" end="00:47:46.931" style="s2"> 95%, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.202" end="00:47:48.845" style="s2"> That was a huge blow</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.290" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2"> It takes months to wake up</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.432" end="00:47:55.585" style="s2"> Then realized that you were almost a piece of deadwood</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.681" end="00:47:57.484" style="s2"> This is a heavy hammer</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.246" end="00:47:58.987" style="s2"> You might think</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.071" end="00:48:00.793" style="s2"> &quot;Well, do you really want to burn all the deadwood?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.253" end="00:48:02.839" style="s2"> &quot;Well, there is only a little empty shell left.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.839" end="00:48:03.956" style="s2"> &quot;Only 5% of you are left.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.165" end="00:48:07.766" style="s2"> If that 5% is solid</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.737" end="00:48:11.211" style="s2"> Then maybe this is exactly what you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.246" end="00:48:16.012" style="s2"> So I said this story is the interpretation of the following verses</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.012" end="00:48:18.643" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.643" end="00:48:22.881" style="s2"> &quot;Everything you think about all day long is evil&quot; (Gen 6:5)</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.288" end="00:48:24.791" style="s2"> This is a question worth asking</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.407" end="00:48:28.111" style="s2"> &quot;What is your motive?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.946" end="00:48:31.472" style="s2"> Maybe their motives are purer than mine</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.597" end="00:48:32.745" style="s2"> It is certainly possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.090" end="00:48:36.190" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think I was born a particularly good person</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.503" end="00:48:38.622" style="s2"> I think I have to work very, very hard to do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.301" end="00:48:41.962" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think everyone is like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.987" end="00:48:45.856" style="s2"> But some people are worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.639" end="00:48:48.737" style="s2"> In a way everyone is so bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.031" end="00:48:51.493" style="s2"> So it&#39;s worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.328" end="00:48:54.603" style="s2"> &quot;How much trouble did you try to cause?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.616" end="00:48:57.349" style="s2"> There is one more thing you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.349" end="00:48:59.426" style="s2"> If you are not using your life to do something important</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.781" end="00:49:00.971" style="s2"> In terms of your own definition</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.106" end="00:49:02.724" style="s2"> Because that&#39;s the game we are participating in</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.724" end="00:49:05.292" style="s2"> You have to define these terms at least from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.075" end="00:49:07.578" style="s2"> Maybe you get into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.578" end="00:49:09.405" style="s2"> But because you didn’t have better things to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.096" end="00:49:13.476" style="s2"> Trouble is more fun than boring</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.165" end="00:49:16.127" style="s2"> If you read Dostoyevsky, you will understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.127" end="00:49:18.131" style="s2"> Dostoevsky understood this very well</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.685" end="00:49:22.651" style="s2"> So if you don’t push yourself to the limit</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.944" end="00:49:29.614" style="s2"> Then you have countless excess will energy and resources</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.614" end="00:49:31.879" style="s2"> Used to create interesting disasters</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.217" end="00:49:36.889" style="s2"> I also think this is the prototype scene of this passage</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.276" end="00:49:39.896" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah sees that people are sinful on earth</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.906" end="00:49:43.361" style="s2"> &quot;Everything you think about all day long is evil&quot; (Genesis 6:5)</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.551" end="00:49:46.002" style="s2"> It&#39;s worth thinking about here</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.547" end="00:49:49.217" style="s2"> That&#39;s not self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.217" end="00:49:53.006" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s like a diagnosis of a disease</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.006" end="00:49:56.597" style="s2"> It&#39;s like if you are really like that to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.597" end="00:49:59.656" style="s2"> May only account for 10% of you may account for 90%</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.136" end="00:50:02.422" style="s2"> It would be great to be aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.422" end="00:50:04.321" style="s2"> Because you may not do it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.198" end="00:50:07.182" style="s2"> why not</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:11.326" style="s2"> You obviously have to abandon all your anger and hate these emotions</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.326" end="00:50:12.369" style="s2"> That&#39;s really annoying</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.369" end="00:50:15.825" style="s2"> Because these emotions are easy to fall into</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.420" end="00:50:17.411" style="s2"> They are addictive</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.610" end="00:50:22.077" style="s2"> With a sense of self-righteousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.228" end="00:50:26.347" style="s2"> But you are not doing this to hurt yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.347" end="00:50:29.603" style="s2"> You are doing this</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.916" end="00:50:32.735" style="s2"> Leave behind what you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.355" end="00:50:42.443" style="s2"> &quot;Jehovah regretted making man on earth</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.443" end="00:50:43.747" style="s2"> &quot;Sorrow in the heart&quot; (Gen 6:6)</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.405" end="00:50:45.083" style="s2"> &quot;The Lord says</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.083" end="00:50:48.017" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;I will create</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:50.313" style="s2"> &quot;『With animals and insects</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.313" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2"> &quot;『And all the birds in the sky are wiped out from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.409" end="00:50:53.372" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;I regret it because I made them&quot;&quot; (Genesis 6:7)</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.196" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2"> What is the main point of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.543" end="00:50:59.342" style="s2"> The theme is that the universe created by God has fallen</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.157" end="00:51:01.002" style="s2"> It&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.002" end="00:51:04.781" style="s2"> This is another point that &quot;Genesis&quot; always poked me</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.781" end="00:51:07.422" style="s2"> And the facts are true</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.672" end="00:51:09.478" style="s2"> I told you that Mesopotamians believe</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.478" end="00:51:12.871" style="s2"> Human beings are made of Jin Gu&#39;s blood</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.871" end="00:51:17.129" style="s2"> He is the worst monster the Chaos Behemoth can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:19.311" style="s2"> This is a very harsh conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.770" end="00:51:22.046" style="s2"> But the reason the Mesopotamians believe so is</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.046" end="00:51:25.344" style="s2"> They understand as much as the author of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.344" end="00:51:31.775" style="s2"> Human beings are the only ones in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:36.816" style="s2"> A creature capable of consciously deceiving and doing evil</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.850" end="00:51:40.083" style="s2"> The question is to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.083" end="00:51:43.622" style="s2"> Deliberate deception and evil</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.935" end="00:51:45.814" style="s2"> Would spoil things so badly</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.065" end="00:51:48.622" style="s2"> So that they might as well have never existed</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.501" end="00:51:52.202" style="s2"> You will see stories like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.518" end="00:51:56.639" style="s2"> There is a flood-related story in the Epic of Gilgamesh</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.639" end="00:52:00.543" style="s2"> Have the same underlying narrative structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.543" end="00:52:02.797" style="s2"> In fact, some people think that Noah’s story comes from this</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.633" end="00:52:08.779" style="s2"> The gods regretted their creation and made a decision</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.395" end="00:52:12.401" style="s2"> It is better to clear them than to let them thrive</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.620" end="00:52:15.146" style="s2"> You will see the same thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.146" end="00:52:18.518" style="s2"> Early gods in &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.894" end="00:52:22.944" style="s2"> It can be said to be a representative of &quot;great men on earth&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.486" end="00:52:25.783" style="s2"> They made too much noise, too indifferent and sloppy</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.004" end="00:52:29.946" style="s2"> So Diamat, the original god of creation, and her partner</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:32.902" style="s2"> Determined to purge them from the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.154" end="00:52:40.157" style="s2"> If you read similar text</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.157" end="00:52:44.029" style="s2"> If you read it from the historical perspective of UBM</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.029" end="00:52:45.678" style="s2"> It has a depth</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.411" end="00:52:53.309" style="s2"> Beyond the ancient and fairytale elements of the story itself</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.397" end="00:52:58.758" style="s2"> I have read some terrible things that happened in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:01.889" style="s2"> And what happened when Japan invaded China</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.286" end="00:53:05.689" style="s2"> Such things are not uncommon in human history</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.484" end="00:53:09.175" style="s2"> Things will get so bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.781" end="00:53:13.643" style="s2"> It takes the imagination of an extreme villain to conceptualize it</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.919" end="00:53:17.516" style="s2"> When things are so bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.808" end="00:53:20.188" style="s2"> It can only be described by the words of the most evil person</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.106" end="00:53:23.382" style="s2"> When I receive visiting customers</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.382" end="00:53:25.251" style="s2"> Found another thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.294" end="00:53:29.405" style="s2"> When their lives are really not good</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.470" end="00:53:34.530" style="s2"> When they almost commit suicide or want to kill</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.812" end="00:53:37.109" style="s2"> Or when something happened at home</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.109" end="00:53:38.768" style="s2"> It&#39;s too corrupt and bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.768" end="00:53:40.365" style="s2"> Those things can be traced back several generations ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.365" end="00:53:42.850" style="s2"> Doomed to misery and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.246" end="00:53:47.338" style="s2"> The only language that can describe this situation is religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.965" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2"> Because there is no other language to describe</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.438" end="00:53:52.933" style="s2"> The seriousness of what happened</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.340" end="00:53:55.365" style="s2"> Maybe you have never encountered</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.365" end="00:53:58.476" style="s2"> A situation that requires such seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.476" end="00:54:02.182" style="s2"> But that doesn’t mean that situation doesn’t exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.182" end="00:54:03.142" style="s2"> They do exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.706" end="00:54:08.184" style="s2"> You will do everything you can to avoid falling into it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.184" end="00:54:09.530" style="s2"> But they do exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.530" end="00:54:12.766" style="s2"> You encounter one or two similar situations at a certain point in your life</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.891" end="00:54:15.355" style="s2"> This possibility is very high</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.553" end="00:54:19.029" style="s2"> You will get entangled with someone who is inherently malicious</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.530" end="00:54:21.524" style="s2"> Maybe the malicious person is you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.004" end="00:54:23.413" style="s2"> That would be a huge blow</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.883" end="00:54:28.925" style="s2"> Then these poetic descriptions become more real</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.334" end="00:54:33.278" style="s2"> &quot;Only Noah found favor in the sight of the Lord&quot; (Genesis 6:8)</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.207" end="00:54:36.023" style="s2"> &quot;The descendants of Noah are written below</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.900" end="00:54:38.361" style="s2"> &quot;Noah is a righteous man</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.361" end="00:54:40.031" style="s2"> &quot;At the time, I was a perfect person</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.334" end="00:54:41.545" style="s2"> &quot;Noah walked with God&quot; (Genesis 6:9)</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.983" end="00:54:43.236" style="s2"> This is an interesting verse</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.518" end="00:54:45.679" style="s2"> If you remember the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.211" end="00:54:48.236" style="s2"> What happened to Adam</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.372" end="00:54:51.733" style="s2"> When he ate the fruit on the tree of distinguishing good from evil</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.255" end="00:54:54.175" style="s2"> I woke up with scales falling off my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.207" end="00:54:56.889" style="s2"> He has self-awareness and can distinguish good from evil</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.900" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2"> When God calls him in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:54:59.833" style="s2"> He did not walk with God</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.438" end="00:55:04.530" style="s2"> So Noah is essentially no fallen Adam</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.791" end="00:55:07.463" style="s2"> Noah did something right</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.324" end="00:55:12.036" style="s2"> Urge God to forgive him</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.401" end="00:55:15.386" style="s2"> Or to show him a way through chaos</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.386" end="00:55:16.315" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.597" end="00:55:18.800" style="s2"> This is worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.820" end="00:55:21.670" style="s2"> Because you will have this situation in your life</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.722" end="00:55:24.301" style="s2"> You are facing the chaos that is about to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.000" end="00:55:28.351" style="s2"> Maybe it was a terrible disaster in your family</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.351" end="00:55:30.282" style="s2"> Maybe it happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.282" end="00:55:32.349" style="s2"> The wider social dimension</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.497" end="00:55:34.896" style="s2"> But chaos is coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.313" end="00:55:36.670" style="s2"> What you will want to know is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.670" end="00:55:38.695" style="s2"> Unless you want to be a member of the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.695" end="00:55:39.958" style="s2"> Even one of the contributors</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.958" end="00:55:41.284" style="s2"> Maybe this is what you want</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.284" end="00:55:44.635" style="s2"> Because in that situation many people would choose</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.900" end="00:55:48.560" style="s2"> What you want to know is</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.503" end="00:55:53.466" style="s2"> How to build an Ark to tide over the difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.276" end="00:55:59.353" style="s2"> If you are interested in life</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.353" end="00:56:01.503" style="s2"> If you are interested in an honest being</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.503" end="00:56:06.701" style="s2"> If you don’t want to cause any unnecessary pain</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.701" end="00:56:08.560" style="s2"> Then you will want to know</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.935" end="00:56:10.376" style="s2"> What to do when disaster strikes</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:15.480" style="s2"> So you have ample possibility to get over the difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.284" end="00:56:17.651" style="s2"> Restart</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.436" end="00:56:22.109" style="s2"> When this ancient story is told</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.038" end="00:56:25.543" style="s2"> &quot;Well, God is not happy, he wants to destroy everything&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.075" end="00:56:28.288" style="s2"> Then you better think about it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.639" end="00:56:32.610" style="s2"> Then the story goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.996" end="00:56:35.292" style="s2"> &quot;But there is someone who follows another way of being</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.292" end="00:56:36.701" style="s2"> &quot;So that he survived.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.952" end="00:56:38.810" style="s2"> This is worth your serious consideration</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.530" end="00:56:41.587" style="s2"> You may want to know what the mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.587" end="00:56:43.132" style="s2"> Because you might need it</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.852" end="00:56:47.192" style="s2"> These things are very practical in the deepest sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.317" end="00:56:49.405" style="s2"> They are real in terms of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.405" end="00:56:51.670" style="s2"> They are practical in terms of operability</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.662" end="00:56:54.228" style="s2"> So Noah walked with God</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.804" end="00:56:57.871" style="s2"> I’m going to jump to the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.294" end="00:57:03.361" style="s2"> I said at the beginning of the lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.480" end="00:57:07.234" style="s2"> The Bible is a hyperlinked text</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.234" end="00:57:09.123" style="s2"> Everything is connected</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.545" end="00:57:13.570" style="s2"> Reading in order is helpful</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.570" end="00:57:14.979" style="s2"> But the Bible is not a linear document</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.167" end="00:57:16.096" style="s2"> The Bible is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.620" end="00:57:18.747" style="s2"> There are countless ways you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.029" end="00:57:20.365" style="s2"> Books to read</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.608" end="00:57:23.205" style="s2"> you can choose</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.998" end="00:57:25.251" style="s2"> Countless ways to read it</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.326" end="00:57:27.495" style="s2"> All text</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.455" end="00:57:31.566" style="s2"> Are expanding and quoting the rest of the text</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.599" end="00:57:35.063" style="s2"> I want to jump to the Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.063" end="00:57:36.013" style="s2"> I think it might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.013" end="00:57:38.194" style="s2"> The most critical text in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.196" end="00:57:40.887" style="s2"> I think this passage</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.409" end="00:57:46.879" style="s2"> Most clearly explain</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.589" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2"> What does it mean to &quot;walk with God&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:52.735" style="s2"> Then you will be in the ark when the flood comes</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.643" end="00:57:56.054" style="s2"> This passage is a metaphor for &quot;walking with God&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.056" end="00:58:00.950" style="s2"> The most clear presentation of the abstracted concept</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.587" end="00:58:03.946" style="s2"> If I say you should be like Noah</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.946" end="00:58:05.512" style="s2"> Walk with God to build the Ark</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.512" end="00:58:10.605" style="s2"> Obviously this is a poetic and metaphorical suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.856" end="00:58:12.975" style="s2"> Difficult to apply in practice</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.979" end="00:58:17.067" style="s2"> You are very different from the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.067" end="00:58:19.718" style="s2"> Not easy to put into practice in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.449" end="00:58:24.572" style="s2"> The experience of the archetype must be distinguished and clarified</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.572" end="00:58:28.424" style="s2"> Make it practical and personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.424" end="00:58:29.833" style="s2"> So you can actually practice it</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.875" end="00:58:32.192" style="s2"> So I will talk about part of the Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.693" end="00:58:34.363" style="s2"> The Sermon on the Mount begins with chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.530" end="00:58:36.148" style="s2"> But I won’t talk about the fifth chapter of Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.148" end="00:58:38.466" style="s2"> I’ll talk about the end of Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.466" end="00:58:40.407" style="s2"> And most of Chapter 7</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.046" end="00:58:44.405" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;How do you want to grow lilies in the wild</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.833" end="00:58:47.537" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;It does not work nor does it spin threads&quot; (Matthew 6:28)</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.006" end="00:58:49.259" style="s2"> &quot;『But I tell you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.365" end="00:58:51.983" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;When Solomon was extremely glorious</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.983" end="00:58:53.977" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;What he wears is not as good as this flower&#39;&quot; (Matthew 6:29)</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.731" end="00:58:58.549" style="s2"> &quot;『You little believers</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.685" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;The grass in the wild is still today and will be thrown in the furnace tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.388" end="00:59:05.345" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;God gave it such a decoration, how about you&quot;&quot; (Matthew 6:30)</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.345" end="00:59:07.015" style="s2"> &quot;『So don’t worry</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.015" end="00:59:08.800" style="s2"> &quot;『What to eat and drink</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.852" end="00:59:11.336" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;What to wear&quot;&quot; (Matthew 6:31)</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.265" end="00:59:13.236" style="s2"> This is a very famous verse</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.236" end="00:59:15.136" style="s2"> Kind of like a &quot;hippie&quot; Christ</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.033" end="00:59:17.777" style="s2"> Seems to mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.831" end="00:59:21.305" style="s2"> &quot;Let&#39;s do what I want&quot; is an old saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.587" end="00:59:25.605" style="s2"> &quot;Do your own thing and you will lack nothing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.743" end="00:59:30.512" style="s2"> This passage is often interpreted like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.127" end="00:59:35.793" style="s2"> But this is really not a reasonable explanation</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.232" end="00:59:39.551" style="s2"> Because this command contains implicit conditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.167" end="00:59:41.441" style="s2"> This implicit condition is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.708" end="00:59:46.326" style="s2"> &quot;『All the things you need</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.326" end="00:59:47.902" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Your Heavenly Father Knows&#39;&quot; (Matthew 6:32)</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.050" end="00:59:51.879" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;You must first seek his kingdom and his righteousness</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.889" end="00:59:53.622" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;These things will be added to you&quot;&quot; (Matthew 6:33)</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.821" end="00:59:57.140" style="s2"> This is very different from hippies, right</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.975" end="01:00:00.804" style="s2"> This is a very interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.044" end="01:00:04.134" style="s2"> Must be one of the deepest views I have ever seen</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.065" end="01:00:07.891" style="s2"> This view is to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.653" end="01:00:10.595" style="s2"> If you set life goals</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.180" end="01:00:13.695" style="s2"> What you really do</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.695" end="01:00:16.545" style="s2"> Aiming at the highest good possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.526" end="01:00:19.342" style="s2"> Then what you need</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.940" end="01:00:24.760" style="s2"> Things that sustain daily life</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.115" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2"> Will be added to you naturally</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.633" end="01:00:32.004" style="s2"> This is an assumption but not a simple one</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.599" end="01:00:33.727" style="s2"> It mainly says</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.967" end="01:00:37.328" style="s2"> If you have the courage to do the hardest thing you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.662" end="01:00:41.169" style="s2"> Will make your life better than doing other things</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.942" end="01:00:43.466" style="s2"> So how do you know if this is true</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.883" end="01:00:45.063" style="s2"> This is what Kierkegaard said</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.063" end="01:00:45.741" style="s2"> &quot;Leap of Confidence&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.793" end="01:00:47.307" style="s2"> Unless you act</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.307" end="01:00:48.466" style="s2"> Otherwise you can’t know if it’s true</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.624" end="01:00:51.441" style="s2"> No one can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.745" end="01:00:54.134" style="s2"> Because others can work</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.802" end="01:00:56.681" style="s2"> Of course this is also very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.712" end="01:00:58.309" style="s2"> Can others prove that it is equally feasible for you</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.309" end="01:01:00.397" style="s2"> You must have no reservations in this game</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.846" end="01:01:01.785" style="s2"> This view is to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.223" end="01:01:05.219" style="s2"> &quot;You must first seek his kingdom and his righteousness&quot; (Matthew 6:33)</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.219" end="01:01:09.708" style="s2"> When you say don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.021" end="01:01:12.704" style="s2"> What to eat and what to wear</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.704" end="01:01:14.843" style="s2"> This is actually a pretty important warning</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.013" end="01:01:17.317" style="s2"> This view essentially says</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.317" end="01:01:19.750" style="s2"> In comparison, the problem of food and clothing is trivial</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.157" end="01:01:24.196" style="s2"> If you live right in the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.478" end="01:01:28.226" style="s2"> Then most likely you will get these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.226" end="01:01:30.345" style="s2"> I believe this is right</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.649" end="01:01:33.633" style="s2"> I have observed how people behave in the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.633" end="01:01:34.478" style="s2"> I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.338" end="01:01:40.052" style="s2"> The most effective way to behave is</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.052" end="01:01:42.620" style="s2"> Conceive the highest good</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.620" end="01:01:45.418" style="s2"> And then strive to achieve it</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.741" end="01:01:49.635" style="s2"> If you really know what success is</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.094" end="01:01:52.651" style="s2"> Then this is success</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.651" end="01:01:54.906" style="s2"> The most practical way</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.764" end="01:02:04.311" style="s2"> This is the concept that this sermon wants to convey</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.770" end="01:02:07.495" style="s2"> It’s like Pinocchio’s story</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:10.564" style="s2"> What happened at the beginning of the Pinocchio story was</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.564" end="01:02:12.829" style="s2"> Geppetto makes a wish to a star</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.829" end="01:02:13.946" style="s2"> We have talked a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.946" end="01:02:14.979" style="s2"> What Geppetto did is</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.856" end="01:02:18.925" style="s2"> He conceived the highest good</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.925" end="01:02:21.785" style="s2"> Take this as a benchmark</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.925" end="01:02:26.785" style="s2"> He made up his mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.098" end="01:02:29.750" style="s2"> Focus on that star</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.750" end="01:02:33.560" style="s2"> For him, that star is a possible creation</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.747" end="01:02:37.902" style="s2"> The puppet manipulated by invisible power</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.977" end="01:04:06.190" style="s2"> But the fable is about ants working and grasshoppers fooling around</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.380" end="01:08:43.862" style="s2"> Others need to solve these problems</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.862" end="01:08:47.317" style="s2"> It&#39;s the responsibility of others</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.000" end="01:08:56.639" style="s2"> Then you won&#39;t solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.756" end="01:08:59.562" style="s2"> No matter what you did or did not do</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.562" end="01:09:00.887" style="s2"> You will stay blind</p>

<p begin="01:09:03.090" end="01:09:05.616" style="s2"> So it&#39;s best to think like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.616" end="01:09:07.944" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m probably blind in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.393" end="01:09:11.399" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe there is a way to correct it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.649" end="01:09:14.092" style="s2"> Because you are very likely to be blind in all aspects</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.324" end="01:09:16.910" style="s2"> In fact it almost must be like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.328" end="01:09:20.240" style="s2"> So think about &quot;Where did I go wrong?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.681" end="01:09:24.113" style="s2"> Would be more helpful</p>

<p begin="01:10:23.852" end="01:10:25.011" style="s2"> Sit down and think about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.011" end="01:10:29.489" style="s2"> &quot;It’s not very happy now.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.489" end="01:10:30.971" style="s2"> &quot;We don&#39;t know what to do next.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.681" end="01:10:32.401" style="s2"> I always think</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.965" end="01:10:34.332" style="s2"> &quot;Of course it&#39;s her fault&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.332" end="01:10:36.055" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s obviously her fault</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.589" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2"> &quot;At least she has 95% responsibility&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.583" end="01:10:45.470" style="s2"> &quot;But maybe I also have 5% responsibility&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.420" end="01:10:47.537" style="s2"> I will sit down and think</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.414" end="01:10:51.075" style="s2"> Then ask myself a question</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.535" end="01:10:53.591" style="s2"> &quot;Did I do anything in the past six months</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.883" end="01:10:57.610" style="s2"> &quot;Make this kind of deadlock more likely&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.382" end="01:11:00.898" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know how fast your brain will</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.898" end="01:11:03.299" style="s2"> To answer this question</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.622" end="01:11:06.305" style="s2"> No doubt you did some stupid things</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.305" end="01:11:07.954" style="s2"> You know in your heart that you remember these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.174" end="01:11:10.084" style="s2"> These things have improved to make you think</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.560" end="01:11:15.136" style="s2"> Then you can tell them these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:17.161" style="s2"> Then you can talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.485" end="01:11:19.009" style="s2"> Especially if they did the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.322" end="01:11:23.226" style="s2"> You would say &quot;I am such an idiot&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.071" end="01:11:25.668" style="s2"> The other person will say &quot;Okay&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.044" end="01:11:26.963" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m such an idiot too&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.963" end="01:11:28.027" style="s2"> Then you two are idiots</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.069" end="01:11:29.739" style="s2"> Maybe you can talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.890" end="01:11:32.631" style="s2"> &quot;『You hypocrites</p>

<p begin="01:11:41.117" end="01:11:42.224" style="s2"> Hard to disagree with this</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.027" end="01:11:44.541" style="s2"> &quot;『If you ask, I will give you</p>

<p begin="01:11:53.800" end="01:11:55.814" style="s2"> This also sounds very optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.284" end="01:12:01.597" style="s2"> But also I think this is a description of the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.111" end="01:12:03.998" style="s2"> I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.338" end="01:12:09.426" style="s2"> I observed during clinical treatment</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.426" end="01:12:11.650" style="s2"> I can see it in my students</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.485" end="01:12:15.251" style="s2"> People&#39;s lives are not what they want</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.086" end="01:12:17.589" style="s2"> You will ask &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.132" end="01:12:20.679" style="s2"> Let’s not mention the tragedies and disasters in life</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.961" end="01:12:22.568" style="s2"> It goes without saying</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.975" end="01:12:24.176" style="s2"> We do not discuss this issue</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.499" end="01:12:25.616" style="s2"> Although to varying degrees</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.616" end="01:12:29.061" style="s2"> Your tragedy was created by you</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.384" end="01:12:32.568" style="s2"> But I don’t think every bad thing happens to people</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.568" end="01:12:36.211" style="s2"> Are all deserved results</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.712" end="01:12:39.353" style="s2"> I think this is a very dangerous premise</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.729" end="01:12:42.432" style="s2"> Especially because everyone will get sick and die</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.558" end="01:12:49.875" style="s2"> One of the main reasons why people cannot get what they want</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.875" end="01:12:52.422" style="s2"> Because I didn’t figure out what I really wanted</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.009" end="01:12:57.067" style="s2"> You might get something good for you</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.067" end="01:12:59.228" style="s2"> This may be better than what you want</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.219" end="01:13:03.299" style="s2"> You may easily get wrong what you want</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.654" end="01:13:06.263" style="s2"> But you may get something that is really good for you</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.746" end="01:13:09.437" style="s2"> Why can&#39;t you get it</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.199" end="01:13:11.305" style="s2"> Because you don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.401" end="01:13:13.341" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t think like this</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.833" end="01:13:16.702" style="s2"> &quot;What if I had this&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.869" end="01:13:19.262" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.614" end="01:13:22.036" style="s2"> You have to force it by manipulating the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.119" end="01:13:25.324" style="s2"> Dedicated to you something like property or status</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.324" end="01:13:26.576" style="s2"> That was not what I meant</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.952" end="01:13:27.933" style="s2"> I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.581" end="01:13:30.334" style="s2"> Imagine you are taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.334" end="01:13:32.349" style="s2"> Like taking care of the person you care about most</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.881" end="01:13:35.313" style="s2"> Then you think &quot;I am taking care of this person</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.313" end="01:13:38.142" style="s2"> &quot;I hope the best things happen to this person&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.497" end="01:13:40.293" style="s2"> &quot;What does this person&#39;s life look like?</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.470" end="01:13:41.952" style="s2"> &quot;Is it possible?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.027" end="01:13:43.946" style="s2"> People don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.946" end="01:13:45.073" style="s2"> People don&#39;t sit down and think</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.073" end="01:13:46.973" style="s2"> &quot;Okay, let&#39;s figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.973" end="01:13:49.238" style="s2"> Obviously your life is difficult</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.543" end="01:13:52.683" style="s2"> After three years you can get what you need</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.009" end="01:13:55.272" style="s2"> But you have to be careful about this</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.689" end="01:13:56.650" style="s2"> You can&#39;t have everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.182" end="01:13:59.009" style="s2"> You can get what is good for you</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.416" end="01:14:00.835" style="s2"> But you have to figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.950" end="01:14:02.140" style="s2"> Then you have to target it</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.675" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2"> From my experience with people</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.981" end="01:14:08.330" style="s2"> If they understand what is good</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.622" end="01:14:10.877" style="s2"> Then target it and finally you can achieve the goal</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.654" end="01:14:14.718" style="s2"> This is a strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.718" end="01:14:15.721" style="s2"> Not that simple</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.004" end="01:14:19.416" style="s2"> You can have an idea about what is good for you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.416" end="01:14:21.253" style="s2"> Then take ten steps in this direction</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.253" end="01:14:23.435" style="s2"> Then you will find that the planning is a bit wrong</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.497" end="01:14:25.272" style="s2"> You have to re-plan your goals</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.449" end="01:14:29.029" style="s2"> You seem to be walking towards the goal like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.604" end="01:14:31.910" style="s2"> But a big reason many people fail is</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.119" end="01:14:35.814" style="s2"> They never set the standard of success</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.336" end="01:14:39.624" style="s2"> Because success is a narrow road and not easy to walk through</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.624" end="01:14:43.758" style="s2"> Your chance of success is zero</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.447" end="01:14:46.055" style="s2"> So this is a proposition</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.055" end="01:14:46.931" style="s2"> The proposition is like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.391" end="01:14:49.885" style="s2"> If you really want something</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.274" end="01:14:52.088" style="s2"> You can have it</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.435" end="01:14:54.823" style="s2"> The issue is</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.011" end="01:14:57.349" style="s2"> What is really what you want</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:03.351" style="s2"> The answer is that you have to readjust all aspects of life</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.925" end="01:15:08.414" style="s2"> Do your best to make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:10.428" style="s2"> This is the concept of sacrifice, right</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.117" end="01:15:15.115" style="s2"> Obviously you won&#39;t get everything</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.877" end="01:15:17.432" style="s2"> But maybe you can get what you need</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.236" end="01:15:21.013" style="s2"> All you have to do is to seek</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.608" end="01:15:24.948" style="s2"> But seeking is not a whim</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.219" end="01:15:26.576" style="s2"> Or just today’s wish</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.892" end="01:15:29.812" style="s2"> You have to take it very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.812" end="01:15:30.512" style="s2"> You have to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.512" end="01:15:32.641" style="s2"> I want to measure myself</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.518" end="01:15:35.460" style="s2"> If I want to live correctly in this world</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.460" end="01:15:38.017" style="s2"> If i want to be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.769" end="01:15:42.495" style="s2"> I think I am more satisfied</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.652" end="01:15:44.134" style="s2"> I don&#39;t mean you have to criticize yourself strictly</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.426" end="01:15:47.046" style="s2"> So what am I aiming for</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.965" end="01:15:49.750" style="s2"> I found one thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.211" end="01:15:53.215" style="s2"> You can try</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.981" end="01:15:56.817" style="s2"> Can test this method</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.881" end="01:15:59.113" style="s2"> Is a form of prayer</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.896" end="01:16:00.376" style="s2"> It&#39;s like &quot;knocking&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.242" end="01:16:02.913" style="s2"> Sit on the bed one day and ask yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.624" end="01:16:08.518" style="s2"> &quot;I will often do stupid things</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.706" end="01:16:11.263" style="s2"> &quot;It will definitely mess up my life.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.526" end="01:16:14.437" style="s2"> If you really ask</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.437" end="01:16:15.961" style="s2"> But you must also want to know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.961" end="01:16:18.038" style="s2"> This is the real meaning of the question</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.111" end="01:16:19.948" style="s2"> Can&#39;t just talk casually</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.948" end="01:16:22.610" style="s2"> You have to make sure you want to know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.382" end="01:16:24.833" style="s2"> And you will soon find</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.833" end="01:16:25.835" style="s2"> The answer will shock you</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.865" end="01:16:30.658" style="s2"> Jung thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.762" end="01:16:33.925" style="s2"> He believes that human consciousness can be divided into two polarities</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.925" end="01:16:37.171" style="s2"> One is the personal consciousness of each of us</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.171" end="01:16:38.936" style="s2"> The other one he called &quot;self-nature&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.345" end="01:16:42.516" style="s2"> You can think of &quot;self&quot; as the inner divinity</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.798" end="01:16:44.343" style="s2"> This expression is more accurate</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.126" end="01:16:48.320" style="s2"> This is the universal part of your consciousness that is conscience</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.716" end="01:16:50.157" style="s2"> It&#39;s okay to think so</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.731" end="01:16:52.171" style="s2"> No matter what your conscience is</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.495" end="01:16:54.050" style="s2"> You can ask for advice</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.050" end="01:16:55.689" style="s2"> Similar to Socrates&#39; &quot;Demon&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.940" end="01:17:00.126" style="s2"> Socrates said he was different from other beings in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.491" end="01:17:03.121" style="s2"> It’s because he would ask his own &quot;Demon&quot; that is his &quot;elf&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.497" end="01:17:07.714" style="s2"> He bowed back and asked himself how to behave in the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.954" end="01:17:09.009" style="s2"> Then follow the inner instructions and put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.009" end="01:17:09.802" style="s2"> No matter what the instructions</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.251" end="01:17:14.990" style="s2"> Socrates did not selfishly demand an answer</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.105" end="01:17:15.668" style="s2"> He will ask</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.222" end="01:17:19.437" style="s2"> &quot;I want to show my best self in the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.437" end="01:17:22.265" style="s2"> &quot;I want to do that, what kind of self is that&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.247" end="01:17:26.817" style="s2"> You are fully capable of thinking, God knows why</p>

<p begin="01:18:06.608" end="01:18:10.741" style="s2"> I think this involves the fundamental nature of being</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.754" end="01:18:14.781" style="s2"> A hypothesis in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.731" end="01:18:19.635" style="s2"> In a way it is another hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.635" end="01:18:21.723" style="s2"> Different from the one in the structure of the Old Testament</p>

<p begin="01:18:30.992" end="01:18:34.687" style="s2"> So this concept becomes a behavior-oriented problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.533" end="01:18:37.464" style="s2"> You put the following proposal into practice</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.464" end="01:18:39.395" style="s2"> I.e. if you behave properly in the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.395" end="01:18:41.618" style="s2"> Being will be presented to you in the form of goodness</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.662" end="01:18:45.449" style="s2"> But you can only know after putting it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.253" end="01:18:47.432" style="s2"> So this is a call</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.766" end="01:18:51.796" style="s2"> Make you feel &quot;If you behave properly in the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.984" end="01:18:54.019" style="s2"> The proposal of &quot;being will be good&quot; is put into practice</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.969" end="01:19:08.101" style="s2"> Will become cynical and full of resentment</p>

<p begin="01:19:29.311" end="01:19:30.856" style="s2"> This is another experience I learned from Jung</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.180" end="01:19:32.245" style="s2"> Jung did not interpret this way</p>

<p begin="01:19:46.837" end="01:19:48.528" style="s2"> This will focus the problem on you</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.528" end="01:19:50.042" style="s2"> Instead of focusing on others to understand</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.303" end="01:19:51.169" style="s2"> this means</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.030" end="01:19:56.681" style="s2"> Conceptualize the question of &quot;how to make things good&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.673" end="01:19:58.852" style="s2"> If things are good for you</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.852" end="01:20:00.188" style="s2"> If you are taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.929" end="01:20:03.153" style="s2"> Then try to benefit others</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.844" end="01:20:06.034" style="s2"> This is reflected in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.034" end="01:20:07.996" style="s2"> Sakyamuni entered Nirvana</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.894" end="01:20:09.708" style="s2"> The story is like this</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.128" end="01:20:13.915" style="s2"> Then he was tempted to stay in Nirvana</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.478" end="01:20:18.215" style="s2"> But he refused and returned to the secular world</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.633" end="01:20:22.735" style="s2"> Because he felt that it was not enough to reach Nirvana by himself</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.735" end="01:20:25.272" style="s2"> Let everyone reach Nirvana at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.867" end="01:20:27.025" style="s2"> To the effect</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.946" end="01:20:31.326" style="s2"> Treat yourself right</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.015" end="01:20:32.965" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.965" end="01:20:36.608" style="s2"> Because you are depraved and shameless</p>

<p begin="01:20:39.311" end="01:20:42.944" style="s2"> An evil and shameful mortal</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.988" end="01:20:45.710" style="s2"> So it’s not easy, you know it well</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.773" end="01:20:48.299" style="s2"> It is not easy to treat such a creature correctly</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.324" end="01:20:51.785" style="s2"> Can&#39;t take it for granted</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.796" end="01:20:54.144" style="s2"> People tend to treat themselves better than others</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.144" end="01:20:55.428" style="s2"> I don’t think this is obvious at all</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.731" end="01:20:57.485" style="s2"> But maybe you can start from yourself and tell yourself</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.485" end="01:21:00.773" style="s2"> &quot;I have to treat myself as if I am worthy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.597" end="01:21:02.516" style="s2"> Then what will it be like</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.693" end="01:21:05.491" style="s2"> I will apply this thoughtfulness to others later</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.205" end="01:21:09.468" style="s2"> The assumption here is</p>

<p begin="01:21:14.833" end="01:21:17.265" style="s2"> Moral wisdom gained from thousands of hardships</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.737" end="01:21:22.036" style="s2"> Through evolution and then manifested in various metaphors and stories</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.036" end="01:21:26.535" style="s2"> And was codified into the written law</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.764" end="01:21:30.324" style="s2"> Pick out a rule that is above all else</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.762" end="01:21:31.796" style="s2"> Then it is the principle</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.503" end="01:21:37.474" style="s2"> This is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.474" end="01:21:39.458" style="s2"> Because it’s saying &quot;this is the law and the prophet&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.042" end="01:21:41.368" style="s2"> The law is the rule</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.368" end="01:21:44.301" style="s2"> But the prophet is the process of rule update</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.802" end="01:21:48.414" style="s2"> So in a sense the prophet is above the law</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.821" end="01:21:52.078" style="s2"> So the view of this particular expression is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.380" end="01:21:56.566" style="s2"> Efforts to improve their own mode of being</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.952" end="01:21:59.510" style="s2"> And committed to perfecting the existence of others</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.073" end="01:22:02.725" style="s2"> This maxim is not just the core of the law</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.725" end="01:22:06.169" style="s2"> It is also the core of the process of formulating the renewal law</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.416" end="01:22:11.107" style="s2"> The meaning behind this sentence is very deep</p>

<p begin="01:22:25.334" end="01:22:27.182" style="s2"> There are thousands of ways to mess things up</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.339" end="01:22:29.562" style="s2"> There is only one way to do it right, or if you are lucky</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:33.696" style="s2"> So realize the path you take when you are doing the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.696" end="01:22:38.048" style="s2"> It’s actually very narrow. This is wisdom.</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.468" end="01:22:41.295" style="s2"> That is the dividing line between chaos and order</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.295" end="01:22:43.696" style="s2"> You should always stand on this dividing line</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.696" end="01:22:45.115" style="s2"> The dividing line is very thin</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.115" end="01:22:47.422" style="s2"> If you lean slightly to one side</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.422" end="01:22:48.466" style="s2"> Then there is too much chaos</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.497" end="01:22:49.938" style="s2"> And lean slightly in the other direction</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.938" end="01:22:51.169" style="s2"> Then there will be too much order</p>

<p begin="01:22:57.881" end="01:23:01.138" style="s2"> This is your deep-rooted instinct</p>

<p begin="01:26:54.792" end="01:26:56.817" style="s2"> Think of it as hell</p>

<p begin="01:27:01.587" end="01:27:03.696" style="s2"> Just like being in eternal hell</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.957" end="01:27:06.013" style="s2"> Thinking like this makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.076" end="01:27:08.403" style="s2"> But you can also remove the metaphysical part</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.424" end="01:27:11.597" style="s2"> Think of it this way, if you are almost a dead tree</p>

<p begin="01:27:14.917" end="01:27:16.952" style="s2"> This is also worth thinking about</p>

<p begin="01:27:29.812" end="01:27:32.954" style="s2"> I think this sentence is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.268" end="01:27:37.025" style="s2"> There is such a reasonable critique of traditional Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.025" end="01:27:39.593" style="s2"> This is also the criticism given by Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.493" end="01:27:44.217" style="s2"> That Christianity failed to fulfill its moral mission</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.614" end="01:27:46.493" style="s2"> Jung is a little more forgiving</p>

<p begin="01:27:47.787" end="01:27:52.172" style="s2"> Nietzsche thinks that traditional Christianity has lost its way</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.631" end="01:27:55.272" style="s2"> Because it assumes</p>

<p begin="01:28:02.078" end="01:28:04.249" style="s2"> This means the work is done</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.487" end="01:28:09.990" style="s2"> I will make a harsher evaluation now</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.637" end="01:28:13.153" style="s2"> This is for succinct language</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.291" end="01:28:15.199" style="s2"> The theme of traditional Christianity is</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.501" end="01:28:18.174" style="s2"> If you express belief in what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.174" end="01:28:21.618" style="s2"> Then you have obtained eternal salvation</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.633" end="01:28:25.000" style="s2"> The meaning of this layer is not so simple</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.084" end="01:28:27.359" style="s2"> But I think this is the true meaning of this sentence</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.359" end="01:28:32.339" style="s2"> This sentence asks &quot;Then how do you enter heaven?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.247" end="01:28:37.453" style="s2"> You can think about this problem from an eternal perspective</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.453" end="01:28:39.739" style="s2"> Or from a psychological level</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.115" end="01:28:41.597" style="s2"> Then the answer is very straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.597" end="01:28:49.489" style="s2"> Imitate Noah&#39;s work to survive the flood</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.240" end="01:28:51.723" style="s2"> Walk with God</p>

<p begin="01:29:16.921" end="01:29:19.865" style="s2"> But you can’t think of a more practical way</p>

<p begin="01:29:22.255" end="01:29:23.153" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t build a house</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.153" end="01:29:24.478" style="s2"> Then can&#39;t live in it</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.478" end="01:29:25.522" style="s2"> If you build a good house</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.522" end="01:29:27.245" style="s2"> Then you can live in a good house</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.673" end="01:29:29.165" style="s2"> If you build a perfect house</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.165" end="01:29:30.355" style="s2"> Then you may live in a perfect house</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.658" end="01:29:34.833" style="s2"> But if the house has been built for you</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.147" end="01:29:38.309" style="s2"> You just verbally said that the house has been built for you</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.602" end="01:29:42.871" style="s2"> Then you can live in a house that meets your needs</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.539" end="01:29:46.149" style="s2"> The possibility does not exist</p>

<p begin="01:30:08.330" end="01:30:09.604" style="s2"> That is a prototype concept</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.282" end="01:30:11.462" style="s2"> Part of the reason it is a prototype is</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.462" end="01:30:13.111" style="s2"> Every day is judgment day</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.030" end="01:30:19.155" style="s2"> The logos of you</p>

<p begin="01:30:22.370" end="01:30:26.013" style="s2"> Will always be judged for your sins</p>

<p begin="01:30:32.787" end="01:30:37.923" style="s2"> And the source of resentment, murder and genocide</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.215" end="01:30:43.466" style="s2"> Because you can intuitively know what is ideal</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.466" end="01:30:45.658" style="s2"> The problem is</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.950" end="01:30:47.433" style="s2"> Ideals always exist as judges</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.623" end="01:30:50.574" style="s2"> There is no difference between the two</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.574" end="01:30:53.007" style="s2"> So you will never stop being judged by your ideals</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.007" end="01:30:53.988" style="s2"> If there is no ideal</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.988" end="01:30:56.357" style="s2"> Then your life has no direction or meaning</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.702" end="01:31:00.825" style="s2"> Of course the more perfect your ideal, the stricter the judgment</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.422" end="01:31:04.228" style="s2"> Jung was curious</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.228" end="01:31:06.556" style="s2"> Why does the Bible add a &quot;Revelation&quot; at the end</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.577" end="01:31:09.635" style="s2"> Because &quot;Revelation&quot; is a very strange book</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.151" end="01:31:13.570" style="s2"> Christ in the Gospels</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.602" end="01:31:15.940" style="s2"> It can be said to be mainly kind</p>

<p begin="01:31:19.124" end="01:31:20.428" style="s2"> The truth and mercy are always at war</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.428" end="01:31:22.443" style="s2"> Competing between the two, kindness probably prevails</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.840" end="01:31:26.650" style="s2"> Jung’s observation is that the Christ in the Gospels is too kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.046" end="01:31:28.247" style="s2"> This is also the &quot;Revelation&quot;</p>

<p begin="01:31:30.888" end="01:31:32.840" style="s2"> Because in &quot;Revelation&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.038" end="01:31:37.307" style="s2"> Christ is the transcendent ideal hanging above the pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.370" end="01:31:39.061" style="s2"> He is the absolute judge</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.155" end="01:31:40.616" style="s2"> No one can pass</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.305" end="01:31:44.165" style="s2"> Of course the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.729" end="01:31:46.378" style="s2"> This is its prototype reality</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.378" end="01:31:47.923" style="s2"> You can say that I don&#39;t want to be judged</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.090" end="01:31:49.614" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to have anything to do with ideals</p>

<p begin="01:31:50.898" end="01:31:53.957" style="s2"> Cain gave up his ideal</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.042" end="01:31:56.399" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.566" end="01:31:58.998" style="s2"> You can&#39;t escape the eternal judgment</p>

<p begin="01:41:18.195" end="01:41:23.090" style="s2"> I think Solzhenitsyn gave</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.090" end="01:41:24.990" style="s2"> Same conclusion as Victor Frank</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.241" end="01:41:28.800" style="s2"> Because he experienced the Nazi concentration camp in his early years</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.272" end="01:41:31.660" style="s2"> I also admire Frank</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.660" end="01:41:33.215" style="s2"> But Solzhenitsyn brought this topic</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.215" end="01:41:35.188" style="s2"> Brings another level of depth</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.909" end="01:41:38.215" style="s2"> And the argument strongly points out</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.197" end="01:41:41.712" style="s2"> Causes of social deterioration</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.712" end="01:41:45.251" style="s2"> Every individual in the society becomes corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.512" end="01:41:47.808" style="s2"> And the only way to save</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.038" end="01:41:51.545" style="s2"> Is every individual in the society</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.754" end="01:41:53.946" style="s2"> Reject corruption within their ability to live</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.416" end="01:41:58.779" style="s2"> He talked a lot about the people he met in Gulagre</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.800" end="01:42:01.410" style="s2"> The Gulag here refers to the death camp in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.566" end="01:42:03.090" style="s2"> This is what he learned</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.101" end="01:42:05.324" style="s2"> Those people are so strong</p>

<p begin="01:42:15.387" end="01:42:18.362" style="s2"> The authorities can&#39;t do anything about them</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.167" end="01:42:22.923" style="s2"> Just watching this is enough to change Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.257" end="01:42:24.980" style="s2"> Of course, after spending some time in the labor camp</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.003" end="01:42:28.529" style="s2"> He also thought about</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.522" end="01:42:32.172" style="s2"> &quot;How did I fall into this field?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.236" end="01:42:36.128" style="s2"> Hitler’s fault, Stalin’s fault</p>

<p begin="01:42:38.581" end="01:42:41.232" style="s2"> But for Solzhenitsyn he felt that he was also at fault</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.932" end="01:42:43.435" style="s2"> Because he is also in the same game</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.550" end="01:42:45.115" style="s2"> It’s just a bad game</p>

<p begin="01:43:21.493" end="01:43:24.562" style="s2"> This is something worth thinking about</p>

<p begin="01:43:56.660" end="01:43:58.351" style="s2"> This is the main point of this story</p>

<p begin="01:44:28.278" end="01:44:30.689" style="s2"> There are many people in the world who are not very smart</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.201" end="01:44:33.675" style="s2"> So they like to understand things rigidly</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.675" end="01:44:36.431" style="s2"> Just like how your child understands when you read a story book to your child</p>

<p begin="01:44:49.625" end="01:44:50.303" style="s2"> Then think about</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.303" end="01:44:53.038" style="s2"> If this story is only what the fool sees</p>
