<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">fueling a new intellectual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.069" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">television made people look stupider</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">than they were it turns out that people</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">are smarter with longer attention spans</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">then we thought I&#39;m a journalist and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">filmmaker for many years I made</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">documentaries for the likes of the BBC</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:26.550" style="s2">and channel 4 but I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">mainstream media can provide the level</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.550" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">of analysis and insight we need for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">extraordinary times we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">where the old structures that made sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">of the world break down it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">entering just entering into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">underworld and it&#39;s a descent we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">and when our ways of thinking break down</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">it&#39;s the rebels and the Renegades who</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.550" style="s2">dare to think differently who are needed</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">to reboot the system and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.550" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">happening is that people are perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">because it&#39;s becoming increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:00.260" style="s2">obvious that all of these artifacts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">the way that we&#39;ve gone about doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.260" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">civilization are breaking down and</p>

<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">consequence this triggers a deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">visceral sense and that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">right because that deep visceral sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">is the return to the aluminum the return</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">to the mystery the shift that we are on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">the precipice of is not like the shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">from the Dark Ages to the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like more like a shift from single</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">cell to multicellular life these are the</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">searching out to try to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">the growing chaos the evolution screwed</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">up it handed us the tools to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to value the game</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">that it is playing and that we can now</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">repurpose the hardware to something</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">that&#39;s actually worthwhile that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">actually had hope in is that if enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">people can come to that realization then</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">then we wake up and not in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:02:00.380" style="s2">evangelical megachurch kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">being born again but in in a truly</p>
