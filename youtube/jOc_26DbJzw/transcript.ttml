<p begin="00:00:28.720" end="00:00:36.850" style="s2">rather imagistic prose poems which</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.140" end="00:00:39.220" style="s2">express some ideas that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.850" end="00:00:42.850" style="s2">wanting to put into a language that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.220" end="00:00:48.700" style="s2">not prosaic in other words that cuts</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.850" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">beneath the level of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.700" end="00:00:56.829" style="s2">touches us on some visceral level so</p>
