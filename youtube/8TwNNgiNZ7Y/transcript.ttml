<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">terrific to have you now in general when</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">I see you interviewed immediately</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">everybody goes straight to crypto</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">currencies in Imperium but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:37.469" style="s2">things that I found fascinating about</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">your story is is that in order to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.469" end="00:00:44.309" style="s2">good steward of this new and emerging</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">economics you&#39;ve actually applied</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.309" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">yourself a great deal to standard and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">regular economic theory and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">curious if I understand correctly you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">dropped out of college after a year</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">you&#39;re self-taught in economics but</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.719" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken a real interest in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:03.290" style="s2">understanding how markets and economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">theory work is that a fair description</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.290" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">yeah I think so and economics has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">of an interest for me definitely for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">long time I mean when I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">Bitcoin back in 2011 and I was still in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">high school it was this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">interesting confluence of ideas that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">was already pretty attracted to so open</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">source culture that was something that a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">and a good friend from high school a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">Christopher all I had already and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">indoctrinated me with really well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">the of the mathematical in cryptographic</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:45.240" style="s2">aspects also libertarianism in Austrian</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">economics was kind of the zeitgeist of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.240" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">the Bitcoin space at the day and those</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">were you know ideas that I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">found philosophically quite attractive</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">at that time and you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">definitely curious and I read a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">books oh yeah and read the Austrian</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">economics Conine because that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">Bitcoin people were kind of talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">about all day I read some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">behavioral economics literature Ariely</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">Kahneman and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">Chea DNA and all of those people just</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:22.770" style="s2">because I knew that I had to read other</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">stuff for balance um and and and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.770" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">economics itself is a kind in pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:30.270" style="s2">mathematical and I&#39;ve subject well kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">of right it&#39;s it&#39;s on the borderline</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.270" end="00:02:35.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of both mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.709" style="s2">and you got your curves and your</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.880" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">derivatives and your intersections but</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.709" end="00:02:42.500" style="s2">also as humanity is right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">really at this intersection of like both</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.500" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">figuring out how to apply these models</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:49.709" style="s2">to and of specific cases and also trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:51.330" style="s2">to figure out well which models are</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.709" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">really correct in the first place and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.330" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">like the first question you can&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:02:57.600" style="s2">with math but the second question you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">really can&#39;t and you need other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.600" end="00:03:04.370" style="s2">thinking as well was this is an area of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">my own interest because the way I see it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.370" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">economics is odd in a way that very few</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">people I think have appreciated in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">if we take what could be argued to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">our two greatest ideas in scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:20.780" style="s2">scientific man let&#39;s say one would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">sort of the geometric dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.780" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">physics and economics has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:28.019" style="s2">constructed to be an as if physics if</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">you will and on the other hand and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.019" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">inherits from the theory of selection</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">you could say that markets are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">continuation of systems of selective</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:39.320" style="s2">pressures by other means and so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">happens when our two greatest ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.320" end="00:03:45.989" style="s2">touch each other and they do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">place which has very bizarre properties</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.989" end="00:03:50.579" style="s2">by my way of thinking that is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">economists are on the one hand very</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.579" end="00:03:54.510" style="s2">rigorous thinkers and are also very</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.890" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">susceptible to what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.510" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">political economy and distorted thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">does that ring true to you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:09.870" style="s2">definitely there&#39;s definitely this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:12.060" style="s2">of combination of I think for on the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.870" end="00:04:15.139" style="s2">hand you have these mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.060" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">formulas and on the other hand these</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.139" end="00:04:21.959" style="s2">assumptions and often like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:23.789" style="s2">assumptions can be pretty pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.959" end="00:04:26.540" style="s2">hidden and they&#39;re kind of difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:28.670" style="s2">see at first glance right in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:33.230" style="s2">it really can be subtle right so like</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.670" end="00:04:34.850" style="s2">one of the arguments that economists</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.230" end="00:04:36.920" style="s2">tend to put forward is basically like</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.850" end="00:04:38.810" style="s2">mutually beneficial transactions are but</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.920" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">are beneficial and so like we should not</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.810" end="00:04:45.500" style="s2">interfere with them right like if I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:46.850" style="s2">a client battle and I want to sell you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.500" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">the wine bottle you&#39;re willing to pay</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.850" end="00:04:50.870" style="s2">five dollars then I clearly value it at</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2">less than five dollars evaluated more</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.870" end="00:04:55.340" style="s2">than five dollars therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.340" end="00:04:57.350" style="s2">transactions on net good and like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.340" end="00:04:58.280" style="s2">therefore I should give you the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.350" end="00:05:02.180" style="s2">and you should give me the money and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.280" end="00:05:06.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what we would do but at the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.180" end="00:05:08.990" style="s2">reasons why that ten sometimes breaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.140" end="00:05:10.640" style="s2">down liquor in many ways more subtle</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.990" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">right like first you have monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.640" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">issues like if I&#39;m the only person</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">selling wine bottles then I might want</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">to sell them at a yeah and a higher</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.420" style="s2">price than you&#39;d be willing to accept</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:24.920" style="s2">because I want to extract more value and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:27.200" style="s2">sometimes the things that matter most to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.920" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">society aren&#39;t things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.200" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">transfer between people from one person</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">to another like wine bottles but like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.340" end="00:05:35.810" style="s2">public goods and like the biggest public</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:39.170" style="s2">good of all is it is the idea right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.810" end="00:05:40.820" style="s2">an idea well if I have an idea and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.170" end="00:05:45.200" style="s2">give you the idea I still have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:47.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s something that once you release</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.200" end="00:05:49.070" style="s2">it it&#39;s out there and there isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.240" end="00:05:50.750" style="s2">kind of property of that so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.070" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">should we just pause just briefly to</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:05:56.450" style="s2">talk about what a public good is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:05:58.220" style="s2">so a public good is technically defined</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.450" end="00:06:01.250" style="s2">within economics many people have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.220" end="00:06:03.490" style="s2">intuitive idea as something which is as</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.250" end="00:06:05.830" style="s2">you&#39;re stating has this property of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.490" end="00:06:09.020" style="s2">inexhaustibility mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.830" end="00:06:12.260" style="s2">and then the other attribute would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.020" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">excludability which is non excludability</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.260" end="00:06:16.940" style="s2">formal sorry not non excludability sorry</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:19.850" style="s2">the the attribute of excludability</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.940" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">mmm-hmm and is used to define a public</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.850" end="00:06:27.620" style="s2">good so if something is inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:30.520" style="s2">and in excludable then it has this weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.620" end="00:06:33.560" style="s2">property that even hardline economists</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.520" end="00:06:35.540" style="s2">would agree that the market may fail to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.560" end="00:06:39.110" style="s2">price in fact will fail to price the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.540" end="00:06:39.409" style="s2">value to society of that object so there</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.110" end="00:06:42.169" style="s2">is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.409" end="00:06:44.269" style="s2">mission within economics that there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:49.519" style="s2">zones of failure right</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.269" end="00:06:52.580" style="s2">well I guess the kind of the big kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.519" end="00:06:54.409" style="s2">rethinking that needs to happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.580" end="00:06:56.719" style="s2">there is a long been this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.409" end="00:06:58.519" style="s2">site-geist to that private goods like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.719" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">things that I have and if I give it to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.519" end="00:07:01.819" style="s2">you I don&#39;t have it and you have it are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.050" end="00:07:04.729" style="s2">the norm and public goods are a rare</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.819" end="00:07:06.409" style="s2">exception but like really public goods</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.729" end="00:07:08.149" style="s2">are pretty darn important right like if</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.409" end="00:07:11.179" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have public goods then we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.149" end="00:07:12.860" style="s2">a trading sticks and B and Bear pelts</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.179" end="00:07:15.379" style="s2">and we basically still be cavemen like</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.860" end="00:07:18.519" style="s2">they&#39;re basically the like an army would</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.379" end="00:07:20.689" style="s2">be a public yeah yeah and or me well</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.519" end="00:07:23.539" style="s2">armies are interesting cuz there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.689" end="00:07:25.219" style="s2">kind of to us like in a medium scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.539" end="00:07:26.959" style="s2">context or a public good and in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.219" end="00:07:28.519" style="s2">large-scale context or a public bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.959" end="00:07:30.469" style="s2">because if everyone&#39;s army is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.519" end="00:07:31.729" style="s2">forced to be cut down by a factor of 10</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.469" end="00:07:34.579" style="s2">like we&#39;d all be better off</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.729" end="00:07:36.259" style="s2">so economics is like really subtle that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.579" end="00:07:40.579" style="s2">way especially once you have kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.259" end="00:07:42.379" style="s2">layers of scale I&#39;d play sure now one</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.579" end="00:07:45.050" style="s2">thing that I worry a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.379" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">almost nobody seems to join me in is</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.050" end="00:07:51.889" style="s2">that in our mutual world I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:54.769" style="s2">what to call it of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.889" end="00:07:57.019" style="s2">experimenting with what I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.769" end="00:08:00.199" style="s2">mainstream would consider far out ideas</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.019" end="00:08:03.649" style="s2">like radical life extension crypto</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.199" end="00:08:06.019" style="s2">currencies is a you know potentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.649" end="00:08:08.539" style="s2">being rival risks with sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.019" end="00:08:11.869" style="s2">currencies but in our world we talk a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.539" end="00:08:14.239" style="s2">lot about the abundance economy in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.869" end="00:08:18.110" style="s2">world of abundance and I&#39;m terrified of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.239" end="00:08:21.019" style="s2">a world of abundance because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.110" end="00:08:23.629" style="s2">properties that software has had is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.019" end="00:08:26.149" style="s2">it has replaced physical goods and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.629" end="00:08:30.649" style="s2">services which have these attributes</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.149" end="00:08:33.649" style="s2">they are not public with small files and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.649" end="00:08:36.649" style="s2">when a small file is not encrypted it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.649" end="00:08:40.659" style="s2">has the attributes of a public good and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.649" end="00:08:44.509" style="s2">therefore value and price can can Qasim</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.659" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">that&#39;s terrifying because then this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.509" end="00:08:49.370" style="s2">weird thing of markets which allows us</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:51.559" style="s2">respite from dictatorship in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.370" end="00:08:52.950" style="s2">directing our activities and allows us</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.559" end="00:08:55.350" style="s2">to self-direct goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.950" end="00:08:56.430" style="s2">away because things can&#39;t be priced</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.350" end="00:08:58.350" style="s2">accurately</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.430" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">are you do you have any does that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.350" end="00:09:03.780" style="s2">any purchase on your thinking yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.580" style="s2">and I think good give definitely you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.780" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">kind of struck at a very important</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.580" end="00:09:09.480" style="s2">points though I think and if my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">framing of the point is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:16.200" style="s2">different no I think like first of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">like you start off by think by realizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.200" end="00:09:19.710" style="s2">that kind of private property and things</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.900" style="s2">is not something that fell out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.710" end="00:09:25.290" style="s2">sky it&#39;s a social technology right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.900" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">that we have these kind of norms that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.290" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">basically say oh you kid we will create</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:35.340" style="s2">this kind of mapping from objects to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:37.050" style="s2">people and if an object as maps to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.340" end="00:09:38.520" style="s2">then you&#39;re allowed to do basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.050" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">whatever the hell you want with it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.520" end="00:09:42.570" style="s2">other people cannot do anything with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:45.960" style="s2">without your permission and if that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.570" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">concept did not exist then physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.960" end="00:09:50.340" style="s2">objects would be public goods right</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:52.020" style="s2">because like if there&#39;s a klein bottle</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.340" end="00:09:53.820" style="s2">over here the quran bottle would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.020" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">there but like really anyone could take</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.820" end="00:09:58.890" style="s2">it and if you produce wine bottles then</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:00.690" style="s2">like you&#39;re not producing something for</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.890" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re producing something for</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.690" end="00:10:05.190" style="s2">pretty much the from the first person</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:07.410" style="s2">who comes along and grabs it and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.190" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">property rights rate are this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.410" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">social technology that helps make</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:15.210" style="s2">private great economy is tractable and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:17.160" style="s2">we could consider making social</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.210" end="00:10:18.780" style="s2">technologies to make public great</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.160" end="00:10:21.230" style="s2">economies tractable right like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.780" end="00:10:24.090" style="s2">existence of public goods by itself is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.230" end="00:10:26.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s not good or bad like arguably</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.090" end="00:10:28.290" style="s2">it&#39;s even good because it means that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.460" end="00:10:30.690" style="s2">people can cooperate with each other on</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:33.510" style="s2">such large scales the bad thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.690" end="00:10:35.130" style="s2">we don&#39;t really have good tools for</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.510" end="00:10:37.830" style="s2">handling yet and specifically we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:42.630" style="s2">have good tools for handling yet that</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.830" end="00:10:45.750" style="s2">managed to simultaneously avoid both not</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.630" end="00:10:48.210" style="s2">giving good results and like basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.750" end="00:10:51.210" style="s2">being centralized in dictatorial and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.210" end="00:10:53.400" style="s2">this is where my interest in radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.210" end="00:10:55.170" style="s2">exchange comes in so this was this a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.400" end="00:10:57.960" style="s2">movement that was started by gone while</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.170" end="00:11:00.900" style="s2">a couple of years ago when he wrote this</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.960" end="00:11:02.610" style="s2">a radical markets book and he advanced</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.900" end="00:11:04.620" style="s2">some of his proposals like harberger</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.610" end="00:11:06.600" style="s2">taxes and a quadratic voting were the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.620" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">ones that are hand of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.600" end="00:11:13.829" style="s2">popular and the and of the core and of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:17.459" style="s2">idea behind the ideas basically as like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.829" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">let&#39;s creates structures of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.459" end="00:11:22.649" style="s2">norms and incentives that try to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:27.329" style="s2">the best properties that we can get out</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.649" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">of markets but do you do so without like</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.329" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">basically economically breaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:34.529" style="s2">way that we know and if existing</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:36.540" style="s2">property right systems do it once you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.529" end="00:11:38.339" style="s2">enter a world where kind of everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.540" end="00:11:41.009" style="s2">that you build just inherently affects</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.339" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">millions of people well this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.009" end="00:11:45.779" style="s2">an interesting perspective you of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:48.449" style="s2">are famous for implementing this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.779" end="00:11:50.699" style="s2">aetherium protocol but before we ever</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.449" end="00:11:53.850" style="s2">get to computer protocols there are sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.699" end="00:11:55.500" style="s2">of legal and structural protocols that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.850" end="00:11:57.899" style="s2">we impose upon ourselves in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.500" end="00:12:01.589" style="s2">government and markets that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.899" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">subordinate to government and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.589" end="00:12:09.380" style="s2">weird way in which you may start a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:12.630" style="s2">process by which you write down rules</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.380" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">for how a society should function but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:17.610" style="s2">once those rules are written down you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">may discover all sorts of unintended</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:23.100" style="s2">properties of that rule set and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:26.850" style="s2">a real question can we actually unhook</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.100" end="00:12:32.279" style="s2">ourselves from the killer app that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.850" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">capitalism or American democracy and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.279" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">we start to realize that that app is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:41.100" style="s2">running out of control</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">I guess in for and of myself as a enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.100" end="00:12:46.050" style="s2">social technologist and I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:48.389" style="s2">don&#39;t think that we should be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.050" end="00:12:49.829" style="s2">overturning entire countries with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.389" end="00:12:52.470" style="s2">new mechanisms overnight</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.829" end="00:12:56.459" style="s2">I think oh and I was insinuating oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.470" end="00:12:59.069" style="s2">definitely I think like that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.459" end="00:13:00.509" style="s2">figuring out how to kind of solve like</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.069" end="00:13:02.490" style="s2">grand problems if Humanity is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.509" end="00:13:03.689" style="s2">long-term goal but I mean short-term</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.490" end="00:13:04.949" style="s2">goals are there is nothing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.689" end="00:13:08.699" style="s2">little things that we can make better</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.949" end="00:13:11.630" style="s2">right so I and this is actually part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.699" end="00:13:13.860" style="s2">why I find a cryptocurrency and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.630" end="00:13:17.130" style="s2">blockchains interesting because they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.860" end="00:13:18.779" style="s2">in a lot of ways this ideal ground for</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.130" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">its economic experimentation or</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.779" end="00:13:26.309" style="s2">different types right so like to give</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:28.620" style="s2">one concrete example in in so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.309" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">ideas that go on while and myself have</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.620" end="00:13:33.050" style="s2">come up with and are pushing forward is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:36.510" style="s2">something called quadratic funding and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.050" end="00:13:39.779" style="s2">the way that quadratic funding works is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.510" end="00:13:41.970" style="s2">roughly this right so you have a central</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.779" end="00:13:43.470" style="s2">kind of pool of funding and you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.970" end="00:13:44.819" style="s2">imagine this coming from a government</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.470" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">you could imagine this coming from</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.819" end="00:13:50.329" style="s2">wealthy donors you could imagine it just</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">in being put together by some like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.329" end="00:13:55.860" style="s2">crypto economic protocol it could come</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:58.769" style="s2">from anywhere and then you allow people</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.860" end="00:14:00.839" style="s2">to basically set up projects and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.769" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">know what people say I have a project</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:04.439" style="s2">here is something that I&#39;m doing and if</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:07.110" style="s2">you like this then you can donate to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.439" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">and give what people donate to projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.110" end="00:14:12.899" style="s2">and then the core of the mechanism is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.939" style="s2">basically that if there is a projects</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.899" end="00:14:16.860" style="s2">and multiple people donate to so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.939" end="00:14:19.880" style="s2">some projects you donate to it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.860" end="00:14:23.220" style="s2">someone else donates to it as well then</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.880" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">your donation doesn&#39;t just benefit you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.220" end="00:14:26.339" style="s2">it also benefits the other person and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">the other person&#39;s donation doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.339" end="00:14:31.559" style="s2">benefit them it also benefits you and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:33.180" style="s2">to kind of counteracts that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.559" end="00:14:35.699" style="s2">market failure the mechanism basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.180" end="00:14:37.649" style="s2">says well we&#39;re gonna multiply the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.699" end="00:14:38.819" style="s2">effect of your donation by two and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.649" end="00:14:41.790" style="s2">multiply the effect of the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.819" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">person&#39;s donation by two and so now both</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.790" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">of your incentives are kind of aligned</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:47.430" style="s2">with the whole and you extend this</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:48.990" style="s2">mechanism so instead of supporting two</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.430" end="00:14:51.149" style="s2">people it supports an arbitrary number</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.990" end="00:14:53.699" style="s2">of people and you kind of calculate</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:57.630" style="s2">these subsidies across all possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.699" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">pairs of people and what you get is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.630" end="00:15:00.870" style="s2">formula that basically says you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:02.759" style="s2">what people donate to different projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.870" end="00:15:04.680" style="s2">you look at how many people donated and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.759" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">how much money you&#39;ve donated and based</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.680" end="00:15:09.329" style="s2">on this from the central pool of funding</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:11.880" style="s2">you give this extra subsidy and so it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.329" end="00:15:16.649" style="s2">basically is like a market for public</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.880" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">goods right and in the etherium</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.649" end="00:15:20.189" style="s2">ecosystem there is something called that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:22.439" style="s2">get coin grants where we&#39;ve basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.189" end="00:15:25.589" style="s2">started like trying to use this</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.439" end="00:15:27.480" style="s2">mechanism to fund public goods inside</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.589" end="00:15:30.209" style="s2">the etherium ecosystem right so this</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.480" end="00:15:32.309" style="s2">could be implementations of the etherium</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.209" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">protocol it could be scaling solutions</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.309" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">it could</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:37.529" style="s2">be wallets it could be educational</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:39.829" style="s2">resources and we&#39;ve had a enough test</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.529" end="00:15:42.120" style="s2">around recently with about and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.829" end="00:15:44.339" style="s2">$200,000 in this central matching pool</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.120" end="00:15:47.009" style="s2">and it recently finished and you can go</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.339" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">to a get coin dot Co slash grants to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.009" end="00:15:51.209" style="s2">the results and we got contributions</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:52.319" style="s2">from hundreds of people and the results</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.209" end="00:15:55.889" style="s2">that gave were actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.319" end="00:15:59.579" style="s2">reasonable so in tests yeah and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.889" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">think if Tyrion can have a lot of value</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.579" end="00:16:05.149" style="s2">is and just being a test net bed for and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.980" style="s2">decentralized governance and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.149" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">decentralized public good finding</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.980" end="00:16:12.300" style="s2">infrastructure of this kind well I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.860" style="s2">that that&#39;s fascinating I guess one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.300" end="00:16:16.620" style="s2">the ways in which I would understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.860" end="00:16:18.569" style="s2">that is you know when my wife who&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.620" end="00:16:21.149" style="s2">economist and I talk about this stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.569" end="00:16:23.250" style="s2">often talk about a market democracy has</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.149" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">these two voting systems one is one</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:25.980" style="s2">dollar one vote and the other is one</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:27.480" style="s2">person one vote</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.980" end="00:16:31.529" style="s2">theoretically anyway even if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.480" end="00:16:33.569" style="s2">honor only in the eye and like liberal</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.529" end="00:16:35.339" style="s2">democracy does this horrible thing of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.569" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">like treating these s opposite poles</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.339" end="00:16:37.889" style="s2">where something is either one or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:39.269" style="s2">other and they&#39;re and they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.889" end="00:16:41.370" style="s2">fighting each other one really</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.269" end="00:16:43.319" style="s2">everything&#39;s a spectrum and I like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.370" end="00:16:45.810" style="s2">a lot I mean an another thing that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.319" end="00:16:48.410" style="s2">been discussing recently and this again</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.810" end="00:16:51.509" style="s2">is sort of drink with with Pia Milani is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.410" end="00:16:54.029" style="s2">thinking about the Chicago approximation</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.509" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.029" end="00:16:59.220" style="s2">incredibly nonlinear and complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:01.259" style="s2">then weirdly yeah in a one of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.220" end="00:17:03.990" style="s2">famous instances where the map is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.259" end="00:17:07.309" style="s2">the territory you take this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.990" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">simplified world where agents have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.309" end="00:17:10.829" style="s2">properties you can&#39;t even believe you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:13.020" style="s2">would ascribe to a human being where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.829" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">thought Homo economicus and you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.020" end="00:17:18.299" style="s2">perfectly rational and it it has all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">these characteristics like an automaton</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.299" end="00:17:24.059" style="s2">that only makes rational decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:26.280" style="s2">then you impose that like through law</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.059" end="00:17:29.549" style="s2">and economics programs and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.280" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve distorted your society by taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.549" end="00:17:34.530" style="s2">the map as the territory so seriously</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">that you don&#39;t realize that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.530" end="00:17:44.070" style="s2">destroying something and distorting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:46.800" style="s2">no that&#39;s definitely a I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.070" end="00:17:49.140" style="s2">social it&#39;s one approximation</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.800" end="00:17:50.970" style="s2">and you mean we&#39;re never going to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.140" end="00:17:52.860" style="s2">approximations that are perfect because</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.970" end="00:17:54.300" style="s2">the world is just so we&#39;re glad to hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.860" end="00:17:58.170" style="s2">that yeah and the world is just so</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.300" end="00:18:01.140" style="s2">complicated and so even rapidly changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.170" end="00:18:03.420" style="s2">in the 21st century like aprox in all</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.140" end="00:18:04.980" style="s2">approximations are bullshit but like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.420" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">have to find a couple of good ones that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.980" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">work reasonably well and make progress</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:09.420" style="s2">for us and I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:11.790" style="s2">things that&#39;s unfairly done to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.420" end="00:18:13.980" style="s2">cryptocurrencies is that we expect them</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.790" end="00:18:16.920" style="s2">to solve all of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.980" end="00:18:19.110" style="s2">already cropped up yes in our forms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.920" end="00:18:21.870" style="s2">governance and our forms of currency in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.110" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">exchange in court systems and that what</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.870" end="00:18:27.150" style="s2">we should be asking of them is to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:30.570" style="s2">improvements or to augment mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.150" end="00:18:34.470" style="s2">already existing systems now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.570" end="00:18:37.380" style="s2">odd things about governance is we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.470" end="00:18:41.400" style="s2">view you as in some sense starting a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.380" end="00:18:44.940" style="s2">rival virtual country that has a legal</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.400" end="00:18:46.920" style="s2">system because the etherium I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.940" end="00:18:50.340" style="s2">what to call it Network platform</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.920" end="00:18:52.470" style="s2">protocol yeah rolls coins and it has the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.340" end="00:18:55.080" style="s2">right to reassign those coins and not</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.470" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">only that but it has a stand-in for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.080" end="00:19:00.230" style="s2">legal system in the form of what are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">called smart contracts mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.230" end="00:19:07.530" style="s2">normally a we have this concept in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:09.480" style="s2">governance I guess it goes back to Weber</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.530" end="00:19:12.060" style="s2">that a government is supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.480" end="00:19:14.070" style="s2">monopoly on violence which is an odd</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.060" end="00:19:17.160" style="s2">definition that you recover the concept</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.070" end="00:19:20.070" style="s2">of government from monopolizing violence</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.160" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">and then you you sort of unearth and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.070" end="00:19:25.050" style="s2">unpack all of the features of government</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">from that one generating function in</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.050" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">some sense a cryptocurrency and smart</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">contracts derive from math rather than</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:37.620" style="s2">violence they derive from math and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:39.240" style="s2">social consensus right I love the fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.620" end="00:19:40.560" style="s2">that I was gonna get to that but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.240" end="00:19:42.750" style="s2">know I guess this is important right</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.560" end="00:19:44.910" style="s2">because like for example you know you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.750" end="00:19:46.380" style="s2">have the Bitcoin blockchain and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.910" end="00:19:49.080" style="s2">have the litecoin blockchain which</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.380" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">operates under ik almost exactly the set</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.080" end="00:19:51.090" style="s2">at the same set of rules as the Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.730" style="s2">blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.090" end="00:19:55.500" style="s2">and yet the Bitcoin blockchain has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.730" end="00:19:56.760" style="s2">hundred million dollar market cap and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.500" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">the white coin blockchain has a three</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:20:00.410" style="s2">billion dollar market cap or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">like that and much less usage so</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.410" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">like blog Chin&#39;s are definitely not just</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">math and technology math and technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">are the substrate and maybe in the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">way that the military is like the</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.390" end="00:21:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s the kind of conquer the world</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.740" end="00:21:32.520" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of you know creating a</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.309" end="00:21:36.360" style="s2">thousand a year kind of reign of sound</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.520" end="00:21:40.380" style="s2">money that I you know I mean I generally</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.380" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">when someone says that like we should</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:45.929" style="s2">impose a lot of short-term disruption</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:47.580" style="s2">and harm on the entire world for the</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.580" end="00:21:51.210" style="s2">that&#39;s something to be skeptical of but</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.650" end="00:21:53.790" style="s2">so I&#39;m not gonna rely on the word</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.210" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">skeptical mmm-hmm you&#39;re using an</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:03.240" style="s2">and so I mean I&#39;m definitely not in in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.360" end="00:22:05.910" style="s2">the camp that had if actively relishes</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.240" end="00:22:09.900" style="s2">like fiat currency is being destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.910" end="00:22:11.400" style="s2">but meanders and I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.900" end="00:22:13.660" style="s2">think that all bitcoiners do it like</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.400" end="00:22:17.020" style="s2">there is some that do see it as</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.660" end="00:22:18.820" style="s2">and of a something that&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.020" end="00:22:21.160" style="s2">coexist and something that&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.820" end="00:22:22.690" style="s2">provide a check and balance against the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.160" end="00:22:25.780" style="s2">government&#39;s monopoly on issuing money</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.780" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">know there are there&#39;s definitely enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.250" end="00:22:31.210" style="s2">different visions within individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">communities there&#39;s different visions</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:38.590" style="s2">in it there&#39;s it&#39;s not just visions</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.550" end="00:22:40.060" style="s2">about what cryptocurrencies should do to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.590" end="00:22:42.580" style="s2">the world it&#39;s also in your visions</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.060" end="00:22:44.230" style="s2">about like what how cryptocurrencies</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.580" end="00:22:47.500" style="s2">should work internally and what they</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.230" end="00:22:51.610" style="s2">should do to each other so that in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.500" end="00:22:53.950" style="s2">sense I guess like cryptocurrencies are</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.610" end="00:22:55.690" style="s2">interesting in in ball chains not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.950" end="00:22:57.970" style="s2">because of luck what they can do in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.690" end="00:22:59.680" style="s2">world but also just as this and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.970" end="00:23:02.260" style="s2">microcosm of the world all into</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.680" end="00:23:05.140" style="s2">themselves like we talked about country</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.260" end="00:23:06.670" style="s2">virtual countries but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.140" end="00:23:08.140" style="s2">there&#39;s many virtual countries now</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.670" end="00:23:10.900" style="s2">there&#39;s over fourteen hundred on coin</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.140" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">market cap and they have some analog of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.900" end="00:23:16.870" style="s2">edgy you think of them as virtual</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:20.230" style="s2">countries it&#39;s singing all models are</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.870" end="00:23:21.730" style="s2">bullshit but some are useful but to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.230" end="00:23:29.710" style="s2">extent that a country is a sensible</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.730" end="00:23:33.550" style="s2">thing - yes yeah yeah so in that world</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.710" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">where we&#39;re dealing with often very</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.550" end="00:23:43.510" style="s2">radical individualism and a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:47.050" style="s2">sense that there is something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.510" end="00:23:49.780" style="s2">the coercive aspect of a government do</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.050" end="00:23:54.540" style="s2">you worry that something that you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.780" end="00:23:59.140" style="s2">given birth to may start to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.540" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">very different ways than you would ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.140" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">want definitely probably the closest</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:08.920" style="s2">that we&#39;ve seen to things like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:11.560" style="s2">happening already would be the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.920" end="00:24:15.370" style="s2">initial coin offering a boom in the 2017</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.560" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">and 2018 and like basically if what</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.370" end="00:24:19.960" style="s2">happens and there was that people saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.650" end="00:24:22.510" style="s2">that cryptocurrencies are something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.960" end="00:24:26.020" style="s2">could potentially had a very high value</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.510" end="00:24:27.490" style="s2">and so people started saying oh like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.020" end="00:24:29.470" style="s2">raising money</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.490" end="00:24:31.210" style="s2">anyone come and I give me 50 million</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.470" end="00:24:32.650" style="s2">dollars and I&#39;m gonna build a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.210" end="00:24:34.210" style="s2">cryptocurrency and I&#39;m gonna make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.650" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">great and I&#39;ll turn your 50 million</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.210" end="00:24:43.450" style="s2">dollars into 50 billion going guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:45.160" style="s2">and this like and like it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.450" end="00:24:47.350" style="s2">right because I mean on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.160" end="00:24:48.940" style="s2">like the possibility of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.350" end="00:24:51.730" style="s2">raising money and using it to fund</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.940" end="00:24:54.910" style="s2">cryptocurrencies development like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.730" end="00:24:56.620" style="s2">it did a lot of good right began like in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.910" end="00:24:59.770" style="s2">general like the open source community</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.620" end="00:25:01.900" style="s2">it&#39;s and it kind of acutely suffers from</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.770" end="00:25:03.670" style="s2">this have public goods challenge that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.900" end="00:25:06.580" style="s2">talked about because an open source</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.670" end="00:25:09.309" style="s2">software is a very public good and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.580" end="00:25:10.809" style="s2">we saw some very public and if splats</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.309" end="00:25:13.540" style="s2">involving open source software being</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.809" end="00:25:15.040" style="s2">under maintains like the CloudFlare and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.540" end="00:25:17.590" style="s2">if issues a couple years back we ran it</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.040" end="00:25:19.300" style="s2">turned out that&#39;s an open ssl library it</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.590" end="00:25:20.920" style="s2">was like really really under maintained</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.300" end="00:25:23.140" style="s2">despite billions of dollars of value</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.920" end="00:25:24.910" style="s2">depending on it and with</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.140" end="00:25:26.110" style="s2">cryptocurrencies suddenly you could make</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.910" end="00:25:28.780" style="s2">things that are completely open-source</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.110" end="00:25:32.160" style="s2">that through coins do have a funding</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.780" end="00:25:34.900" style="s2">mechanism and like you know this has</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.160" end="00:25:36.160" style="s2">Mesnick massively accelerated the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.900" end="00:25:38.230" style="s2">development of many kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.160" end="00:25:40.750" style="s2">cryptography is urinal which proofs and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.230" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">peer-to-peer networking a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.750" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">things but at this on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:49.179" style="s2">like it&#39;s also given rise to this kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:50.350" style="s2">of speculation and in many cases the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.179" end="00:25:53.410" style="s2">projects turned out to be outright</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.350" end="00:25:55.480" style="s2">fraudulent rage but uh it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.410" end="00:25:57.429" style="s2">delicious and weird situation I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.480" end="00:26:00.760" style="s2">asked you about it yet but you&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.429" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">presume that your net worth crashed a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.760" end="00:26:07.570" style="s2">great deal we got run up and then came</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:13.920" style="s2">came back and were you happy in any way</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.570" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">about that relieved relieved yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.920" end="00:26:23.620" style="s2">when the right at the top of the big</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:25.870" style="s2">bubble like in December 2017 when YAG</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.620" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">Bitcoin was hitting 20,000 eath was</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.870" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">hitting 1,400 I made this tweet and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.090" style="s2">series of tweets and that kind of became</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:36.429" style="s2">somewhat famous one in the space where I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.090" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">basically said the cryptocurrency space</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.429" end="00:26:41.140" style="s2">has reached half a trillion dollars does</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.180" style="s2">does it deserve it like do the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.140" end="00:26:45.540" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually accomplished like</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.180" end="00:26:49.000" style="s2">hold a candle to the promises that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.540" end="00:26:51.430" style="s2">market is ascribing to it and I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.000" end="00:26:56.670" style="s2">subtext of my answer is not yet and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.430" end="00:26:58.930" style="s2">was proven very right fairly quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.670" end="00:27:05.650" style="s2">but you didn&#39;t short it did you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.930" end="00:27:08.250" style="s2">so the iana I did can you get and get</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.650" end="00:27:10.750" style="s2">the etherium foundation to sell about</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.250" end="00:27:13.900" style="s2">70,000 East like basically at the top</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.750" end="00:27:15.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s doubled our runway now so it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.900" end="00:27:18.430" style="s2">was one good decision the heddle and</p>

<p begin="00:27:18.430" end="00:27:27.060" style="s2">short I should say that I was weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:32.520" style="s2">somewhat relieved as well I view that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.060" end="00:27:32.520" style="s2">the innovation of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.670" end="00:27:37.630" style="s2">transactions and the bid and you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.370" end="00:27:39.730" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to say because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.630" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">actually I&#39;m convinced that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.730" end="00:27:43.510" style="s2">blockchain should be an intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:46.510" style="s2">state and should not be the permanent</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.510" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">version of decentralized computing angry</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.510" end="00:27:52.770" style="s2">okay but I thought that that was such an</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:57.910" style="s2">amazing innovation that you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.770" end="00:28:00.250" style="s2">locally enforced mechanism without a</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.070" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">a point of intellectual failure that in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.590" end="00:28:12.970" style="s2">some sense you&#39;re mirroring the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:17.260" style="s2">transactions of the physical world so</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.970" end="00:28:20.890" style="s2">for example for those listening at home</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.260" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">who don&#39;t have a visual here Vitalik has</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.660" end="00:28:31.990" style="s2">do right now but the idea would be that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.770" end="00:28:35.230" style="s2">it would no longer be in his space and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.990" end="00:28:40.620" style="s2">it would be in mine and that property of</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.620" end="00:28:46.330" style="s2">Bitcoin and blockchain and aetherium</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.390" end="00:28:49.180" style="s2">transactions mean this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.330" end="00:28:51.580" style="s2">concept of like money as a thing right</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.180" end="00:28:53.920" style="s2">the and if the scarcity of the 21</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.920" end="00:28:57.190" style="s2">have five lesson you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.059" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">five more right and so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.190" end="00:29:02.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:29:02.350" end="00:29:09.460" style="s2">physical layer into the logical layer</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:11.769" style="s2">right and yeah and I guess and if to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">some extent kind of reflects the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.769" end="00:29:16.929" style="s2">very deeply enough Austrian economic</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.929" end="00:29:24.039" style="s2">way better back in the end of 2009 to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.679" end="00:29:27.190" style="s2">2013 days you know I mean creating like</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.039" end="00:29:28.749" style="s2">digital gold was pretty much the food an</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.190" end="00:29:31.450" style="s2">additional payment system was the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.749" end="00:29:33.999" style="s2">use case but I mean I definitely think</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.450" end="00:29:35.649" style="s2">that like we can and should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.999" end="00:29:37.899" style="s2">about point systems that work in ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.649" end="00:29:39.850" style="s2">other than money well I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.899" end="00:29:43.389" style="s2">and I also think that it isn&#39;t digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.850" end="00:29:46.629" style="s2">gold because as the saying goes you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.389" end="00:29:49.269" style="s2">gold or money has no stench and that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.629" end="00:29:51.460" style="s2">blockchain is this bizarre difference</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.269" end="00:29:55.240" style="s2">with the physical world and that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.460" end="00:29:57.999" style="s2">distributed ledger that may be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.240" end="00:30:01.179" style="s2">anonymous but still gives the history</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.999" end="00:30:05.730" style="s2">like if I hand you a dollar and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.179" end="00:30:09.100" style="s2">don&#39;t have access to any particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.730" end="00:30:11.169" style="s2">means of analyzing whose DNA is on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.100" end="00:30:14.769" style="s2">dollar you have no idea where it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.169" end="00:30:17.049" style="s2">and these that is not that is violated</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.769" end="00:30:20.049" style="s2">by the current block chain type</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.049" end="00:30:22.330" style="s2">implementations yes so it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.049" end="00:30:25.779" style="s2">complete port of the physical world in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.330" end="00:30:27.730" style="s2">digital but it is a an astounding one</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.779" end="00:30:30.249" style="s2">and I guess I get very frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.730" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">the economics questions like well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.249" end="00:30:34.350" style="s2">good what&#39;s it good for where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">killer app I mean we have all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.350" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">whatever&#39;s left of human civilization to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:43.179" style="s2">figure out what this thing is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:45.669" style="s2">do yeah and I&#39;m not very worried that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.179" end="00:30:46.990" style="s2">were not going to figure it out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.669" end="00:30:48.639" style="s2">we&#39;re going to figure it out sooner or</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.990" end="00:30:50.710" style="s2">later because a conservation law and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.639" end="00:30:51.960" style="s2">digital space is just too valuable is</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.710" end="00:30:54.519" style="s2">that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.960" end="00:30:57.850" style="s2">are you worried at all about the search</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.519" end="00:30:59.259" style="s2">for like I I just hate this question you</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.850" end="00:31:02.649" style="s2">know where&#39;s that where&#39;s the killer app</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.259" end="00:31:05.320" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking chill out man this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.649" end="00:31:08.200" style="s2">an astounding intellectual achievement</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.320" end="00:31:11.500" style="s2">what is that wrong yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.200" end="00:31:14.680" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely yeah and a long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.500" end="00:31:16.510" style="s2">to go and I think you know the apps will</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.680" end="00:31:18.370" style="s2">come you know there&#39;s the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.510" end="00:31:21.580" style="s2">coming right now are basically a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.370" end="00:31:24.940" style="s2">financial but I think I mean that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.580" end="00:31:26.770" style="s2">of true just in part because the finance</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.940" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">the existing financial system is just</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.770" end="00:31:31.780" style="s2">like so ready and waiting there to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:34.870" style="s2">disrupted event like in the long term</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.780" end="00:31:42.010" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s is disrupted and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.870" end="00:31:43.240" style="s2">polite term for destroyed you choose but</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.010" end="00:31:45.280" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.240" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">here you&#39;re 25 years old</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.280" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">every bit of your adult life is post</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:32:01.000" style="s2">2008 mm-hmm and to be 25 years old and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:02.650" style="s2">in charge of a financial ecosystem to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.000" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">the extent that anyone is in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.650" end="00:32:07.060" style="s2">aetherium and I don&#39;t want to claim that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:09.820" style="s2">you are sitting there running and making</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.060" end="00:32:14.350" style="s2">all these decisions that&#39;s an astounding</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.820" end="00:32:18.520" style="s2">thing that that this has fallen to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.350" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">somebody who whose adult life has post</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.520" end="00:32:24.160" style="s2">the crash hmm do you think about that at</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">all that you don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.160" end="00:32:28.690" style="s2">associations the rest of us do with</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:31.540" style="s2">markets when they were claimed to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.690" end="00:32:33.580" style="s2">working well like during the during the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.540" end="00:32:37.690" style="s2">era of the Great Moderation supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.580" end="00:32:41.800" style="s2">when volatility was banished yeah 13 12</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.690" end="00:32:43.270" style="s2">right so one thing that I had if when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.800" end="00:32:45.340" style="s2">realized the recently that I found</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.270" end="00:32:47.080" style="s2">interesting is that there like there</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.340" end="00:32:49.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t kind of two tribes here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.080" end="00:32:53.770" style="s2">three tribes right and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.270" end="00:32:57.970" style="s2">this is that there&#39;s the tribe that says</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.770" end="00:33:00.490" style="s2">markets are great and there&#39;s the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.970" end="00:33:01.690" style="s2">that says markets are bad and like we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.490" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">should move to more things that look</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.690" end="00:33:07.570" style="s2">like political mechanisms but then if</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:08.740" style="s2">you look at kind of the zeitgeist that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.570" end="00:33:11.500" style="s2">kind of fairly popular in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.740" end="00:33:13.290" style="s2">cryptocurrencies space definitely even</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.500" end="00:33:17.550" style="s2">still now to a big extent it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.290" end="00:33:20.380" style="s2">markets are great but the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.550" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">existed and exists like isn&#39;t markets</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.380" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:27.759" style="s2">so I guess like there&#39;s people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:29.620" style="s2">pro market and who see kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.759" end="00:33:31.570" style="s2">existing financial system as being that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.620" end="00:33:33.429" style="s2">and there&#39;s people who are pro marketed</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.570" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">receive the existing financial system as</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.429" end="00:33:36.879" style="s2">being like yet another one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:39.639" style="s2">perversions of that that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.879" end="00:33:43.240" style="s2">overcome well it&#39;s odd because I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.639" end="00:33:46.990" style="s2">love to fix our democracy I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.240" end="00:33:49.080" style="s2">fix our markets but I am I have to say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.990" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">believe that I have grown up in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.080" end="00:33:56.110" style="s2">approximately 50 year bubble which the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:34:00.779" style="s2">Silent Generation and then the boomers</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.110" end="00:34:03.909" style="s2">presided over and my own read is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.779" end="00:34:06.730" style="s2">because of their inability to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.909" end="00:34:09.310" style="s2">sufficient innovation to take over from</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.730" end="00:34:12.819" style="s2">the previously innovative system that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.310" end="00:34:15.369" style="s2">the world of human expertise has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.819" end="00:34:17.800" style="s2">almost completely contaminated by</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.010" end="00:34:32.169" style="s2">bent are just sick to death of being</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:34:59.710" style="s2">reasons it&#39;s because growth ran out and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.490" end="00:35:03.010" style="s2">our whole society is predicated on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.710" end="00:35:06.040" style="s2">need for economic growth ya know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.010" end="00:35:07.930" style="s2">definitely and of things that are that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.040" end="00:35:10.510" style="s2">have changed in us an assess them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.930" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">just not keeping up and doesn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.510" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand that there is such a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:22.750" style="s2">thing as keeping up and it&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:24.250" style="s2">so like one like that even when talks</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.750" end="00:35:27.640" style="s2">about this right like he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.250" end="00:35:31.060" style="s2">kind of the mortgage markets as social</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.640" end="00:35:35.220" style="s2">technology mentality versus the like</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.060" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">basically end of history mentality and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.220" end="00:35:42.840" style="s2">like the way that I and I definitely saw</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:44.670" style="s2">this kind of zeitgeist ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.840" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">that said kind of even more broadly than</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.670" end="00:35:49.890" style="s2">like markets versus other mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:51.690" style="s2">that&#39;s like things are 80% efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.890" end="00:35:56.910" style="s2">lots of work to make them 95 percent</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.690" end="00:35:58.530" style="s2">efficient whereas the the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.910" end="00:35:59.640" style="s2">really going on is that things are three</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.530" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">percent efficient and we should work</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.640" end="00:36:03.840" style="s2">hard on making them six percent</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:06.930" style="s2">efficient like if you kind of move away</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.840" end="00:36:08.280" style="s2">from the narrow context of like I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.930" end="00:36:09.660" style="s2">have something to sell when you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.280" end="00:36:12.810" style="s2">something to buy which is pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.660" end="00:36:14.849" style="s2">optimized already then there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.810" end="00:36:16.920" style="s2">these and very big things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.849" end="00:36:20.340" style="s2">happening that have just completely been</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.920" end="00:36:24.210" style="s2">missed and in technology and if Network</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:25.710" style="s2">effects and all and just generally kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.210" end="00:36:29.910" style="s2">of migrating from atoms to bits are</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.710" end="00:36:31.500" style="s2">definitely all a big part of it so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.910" end="00:36:33.650" style="s2">talk about something that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.500" end="00:36:36.150" style="s2">funny which is if your start to replace</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.650" end="00:36:37.590" style="s2">government as we were talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.150" end="00:36:42.359" style="s2">and you see it as a monopoly on violence</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.590" end="00:36:44.730" style="s2">you notice that very often there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.359" end="00:36:46.920" style="s2">a very funny role played by organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.730" end="00:36:48.740" style="s2">crime and of course when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.920" end="00:36:50.940" style="s2">organized crime we tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.740" end="00:36:53.780" style="s2">emotionally excited by it for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.940" end="00:36:56.220" style="s2">reason we make lots of movies about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.780" end="00:36:57.690" style="s2">it occupies the mind is something</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.220" end="00:37:01.470" style="s2">terrifying and alluring</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.690" end="00:37:05.820" style="s2">and there&#39;s sort of two weird aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.470" end="00:37:09.540" style="s2">organized crime one of which is violence</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.820" end="00:37:11.940" style="s2">as a contract enforcement mechanism in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.540" end="00:37:14.910" style="s2">other words you&#39;re you&#39;re gambling so</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.940" end="00:37:16.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have access to the regular</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.910" end="00:37:20.310" style="s2">court system now you have a gambling</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.440" end="00:37:26.310" style="s2">debt and so just the way our government</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.310" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">would put you in jail if you you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.310" end="00:37:30.119" style="s2">started doing things you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:31.650" style="s2">fulfill all of your obligations and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.119" end="00:37:35.730" style="s2">were doing harm to lots of people you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.650" end="00:37:38.220" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be stopped organized crime has</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.730" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">to do something can&#39;t maintain jails you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.220" end="00:37:43.470" style="s2">know so it can put the hurt on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:45.869" style="s2">for means of contract enforcement so</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:47.490" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not looking to do violent</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.869" end="00:37:48.200" style="s2">things it&#39;s looking to run illegal</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.490" end="00:37:49.910" style="s2">businesses</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.200" end="00:37:52.099" style="s2">for which there&#39;s demand yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.910" end="00:37:53.560" style="s2">it has a problem of enforcement then</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.099" end="00:37:57.369" style="s2">there&#39;s another part of it which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.560" end="00:37:59.930" style="s2">violence as the product so for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.369" end="00:38:01.849" style="s2">extortion be shame if anything were to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.930" end="00:38:04.820" style="s2">happen to this lovely business that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.849" end="00:38:06.920" style="s2">you&#39;re running is a veiled threat pay us</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.820" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">or we&#39;re gonna do harm to your business</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:12.339" style="s2">or you know contract killings and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:15.109" style="s2">like yeah are you worried that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.339" end="00:38:17.930" style="s2">effectively by introducing parallel</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.109" end="00:38:22.010" style="s2">structures both in the form of currency</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.930" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">and in the form of contracts smart</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.010" end="00:38:27.589" style="s2">contracts that are the cynic wanna and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:30.589" style="s2">guess of the difference between Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.589" end="00:38:33.410" style="s2">and aetherium right that the killer app</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.589" end="00:38:35.089" style="s2">that is most likely to happen while the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.410" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">technology is still clunky and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.089" end="00:38:42.920" style="s2">cumbersome and difficult is in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:46.339" style="s2">parallel space that either you are going</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.920" end="00:38:49.460" style="s2">to replace organized crime as a place to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.339" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">do contractual business outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.460" end="00:38:54.890" style="s2">normal scope which could be a benefit</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:56.869" style="s2">because organized crime still exists and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.890" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">is a bad thing because it uses violence</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.869" end="00:39:01.849" style="s2">and you would use math and in place of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">it or that it could actually be used to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.849" end="00:39:09.530" style="s2">facilitate violence by you know using</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:12.290" style="s2">let&#39;s say prediction markets or</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.530" end="00:39:16.970" style="s2">something else to induce people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.290" end="00:39:20.119" style="s2">commit crimes where the committer the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.970" end="00:39:21.800" style="s2">committer of violence has unusual</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.119" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">information about where the violence</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.800" end="00:39:27.829" style="s2">will be committed and therefore can</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:30.290" style="s2">profit from it it&#39;s definitely a worry</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.829" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">that have I in make lots of people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.290" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">the crypt of space I&#39;ve had since the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:36.530" style="s2">beginning though I do feel like at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:38.089" style="s2">so far I&#39;ve been surprised like it feels</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.530" end="00:39:41.960" style="s2">like a less avetis happens than we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.089" end="00:39:44.329" style="s2">expected the thing now what do you what</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.960" end="00:39:47.750" style="s2">accounts for the idea that something</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.329" end="00:39:51.619" style="s2">that can be dreamt has mostly not</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.750" end="00:39:53.810" style="s2">occurred yes I definitely have a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.619" end="00:39:54.859" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a great thing about humans</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.810" end="00:39:56.359" style="s2">that we didn&#39;t realize that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.859" end="00:39:57.800" style="s2">nearly the horrible people we thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.359" end="00:39:59.750" style="s2">and I definitely have a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.800" end="00:40:01.610" style="s2">theories about this so one of those</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.750" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">theories is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.610" end="00:40:10.850" style="s2">like basically a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:12.770" style="s2">people do and especially a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.850" end="00:40:14.750" style="s2">that people do in the InfoSphere because</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.770" end="00:40:16.070" style="s2">like public goods are chronically</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.750" end="00:40:19.910" style="s2">underfunded and all that rely really</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.070" end="00:40:23.900" style="s2">heavily on goodwill and so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:26.300" style="s2">have goodwill that if someone if you pay</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.900" end="00:40:27.830" style="s2">someone to write some piece piece of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.300" end="00:40:31.010" style="s2">software for your website it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.830" end="00:40:32.600" style="s2">to include some blog oh yeah some bug</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.010" end="00:40:36.200" style="s2">that&#39;ll steal people&#39;s money or tell the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.600" end="00:40:38.840" style="s2">FBI where you are that you if you create</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.200" end="00:40:40.870" style="s2">a system for the enforcing agreements</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.840" end="00:40:44.330" style="s2">that they&#39;ll actually get enforced then</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.870" end="00:40:47.390" style="s2">even like on internet forums they depend</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.330" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">on kind of a lot of volunteer labor for</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.390" end="00:40:53.980" style="s2">just things like moderation and if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:56.270" style="s2">create a group that just goes like</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.980" end="00:40:57.980" style="s2">fundamentally against like the vast</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.270" end="00:40:59.840" style="s2">majority of people&#39;s values then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.980" end="00:41:03.820" style="s2">just gonna be hard to find volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.840" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">effort for that sort of thing and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.820" end="00:41:10.490" style="s2">this so that&#39;s probably the big the big</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">reason I think why ik so far we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.490" end="00:41:15.170" style="s2">really see you kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:18.190" style="s2">complicated like decentralized structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.170" end="00:41:20.840" style="s2">is being created to facilitate like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.190" end="00:41:22.310" style="s2">black black markets for killing people</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.840" end="00:41:23.540" style="s2">and so forth because let&#39;s start off</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.310" end="00:41:26.780" style="s2">with something more mundane like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.540" end="00:41:28.970" style="s2">numbers racket right so a numbers racket</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.780" end="00:41:31.250" style="s2">would probably be a much simpler</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.970" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">application so what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.250" end="00:41:35.630" style="s2">numbers racket here well it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:37.780" style="s2">that takes the place of a lottery where</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.630" end="00:41:40.310" style="s2">some let&#39;s say some naturally occurring</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.780" end="00:41:42.680" style="s2">number that would be printed in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.310" end="00:41:45.350" style="s2">newspaper and presumably nobody has the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.680" end="00:41:48.050" style="s2">influence over what number gets printed</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.350" end="00:41:50.270" style="s2">right constitutes the lotto draw</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.050" end="00:41:54.140" style="s2">lotteries have existed on watching since</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.270" end="00:41:55.880" style="s2">the beginning yeah even there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.140" end="00:41:57.560" style="s2">definitely been this kind of sub</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.880" end="00:42:00.200" style="s2">community if people that created these</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.560" end="00:42:01.820" style="s2">kind of provably faire Ponzi contracts</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.200" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">where and we have a smart contracts and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.820" end="00:42:05.510" style="s2">you can throw money in and as soon as if</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.220" style="s2">you&#39;re the n&#39;s person just throw money</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.510" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">and as soon as soon as to end people</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.220" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">throw money and you get like 1.9 the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:13.970" style="s2">back or something like that and like</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:16.010" style="s2">this was just a fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.970" end="00:42:18.770" style="s2">games that people have made and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.010" end="00:42:21.039" style="s2">participated in even fully knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.770" end="00:42:23.720" style="s2">the economic some of the thing are so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.039" end="00:42:28.690" style="s2">yeah in thing things like that have</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.720" end="00:42:32.089" style="s2">definitely happened so I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.690" end="00:42:34.520" style="s2">though in gambling is the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.089" end="00:42:37.190" style="s2">that like there isn&#39;t like there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.520" end="00:42:38.900" style="s2">this kind of $9.99 percent plus</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.190" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">consensus that it&#39;s really horrible and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.900" end="00:42:42.920" style="s2">evil right because like on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">like lots of people want abandoned but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.920" end="00:42:50.089" style="s2">on the other hand people do it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:51.980" style="s2">something that I think people see</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.089" end="00:42:53.750" style="s2">negative consequences of but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.980" end="00:42:55.250" style="s2">time it&#39;s something is something that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.750" end="00:42:59.299" style="s2">people participate in a little joy</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.250" end="00:43:01.549" style="s2">whereas the I mean if extremely bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.299" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">stuff like that&#39;s there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.549" end="00:43:06.559" style="s2">this kind of this kind of barrier</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">between kind of things that are edgy</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.559" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">versus things that are just so far over</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:15.799" style="s2">the edge and for things that are and if</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:17.869" style="s2">so so far over the edge like it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.799" end="00:43:19.099" style="s2">even with smart contracts and even with</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.869" end="00:43:21.410" style="s2">all those things it&#39;s still hard to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.099" end="00:43:25.039" style="s2">coordinate those structures and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.410" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">like the blockchain like the blockchains</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.039" end="00:43:30.109" style="s2">inability to directly read facts about</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:33.710" style="s2">the real world could even be a saving</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.109" end="00:43:36.410" style="s2">grace here because like because a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.710" end="00:43:38.029" style="s2">blockchain can&#39;t directly read like</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.410" end="00:43:39.710" style="s2">whether or not something in the real</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.029" end="00:43:41.240" style="s2">world happened it basically me and said</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.710" end="00:43:42.619" style="s2">if you want to have some application</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.240" end="00:43:45.140" style="s2">whether a prediction market or something</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.619" end="00:43:46.490" style="s2">else that does okay so can we say a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.140" end="00:43:48.260" style="s2">little bit more about the proud the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.490" end="00:43:48.799" style="s2">intellectual problem that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.260" end="00:43:50.690" style="s2">in touching</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.799" end="00:43:53.000" style="s2">so the idea is that there may be</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.690" end="00:43:58.130" style="s2">something that&#39;s very perceptible to us</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.000" end="00:44:00.020" style="s2">hmm about the real world but we might</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.130" end="00:44:01.900" style="s2">naively think well the computer should</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.020" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">be able to tell whether that happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.900" end="00:44:07.460" style="s2">right or it didn&#39;t happen and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:11.660" style="s2">that&#39;s a surprisingly difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.460" end="00:44:15.230" style="s2">code up reliably so that the interface</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.660" end="00:44:19.420" style="s2">between the world of bits and bytes in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.230" end="00:44:22.279" style="s2">the world of otherwise physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.420" end="00:44:26.150" style="s2">which often we don&#39;t realize we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.279" end="00:44:27.220" style="s2">thinking about subjectively hmm that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.150" end="00:44:30.430" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.220" end="00:44:32.530" style="s2">maintain that interface so that the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.430" end="00:44:34.359" style="s2">in which the things that have happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.530" end="00:44:36.550" style="s2">in the real world can be definitely</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.359" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">agreed upon without us any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.550" end="00:44:40.930" style="s2">adjudication inside of the digital right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:43.270" style="s2">yeah so no I don&#39;t know how to say that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.930" end="00:44:45.730" style="s2">well block chains are an a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.270" end="00:44:47.890" style="s2">programmatic medium all they see is data</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.730" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">that gets fed into them and what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.890" end="00:44:54.369" style="s2">can compute as a result of that data and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:56.920" style="s2">so if you wants to create a smart</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.369" end="00:44:59.560" style="s2">contract that says if someone figures</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.920" end="00:45:01.330" style="s2">out how to what the prime factors have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.560" end="00:45:03.369" style="s2">big number or pay them a reward you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.330" end="00:45:04.510" style="s2">do that because prime prime factors are</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.369" end="00:45:07.150" style="s2">something that you can multiply together</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.510" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">and verify but if he wants to have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.150" end="00:45:13.000" style="s2">smart contract that says if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:14.980" style="s2">hurricane and in Srilanka then pay five</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.000" end="00:45:17.080" style="s2">hundred bucks then like you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.980" end="00:45:19.390" style="s2">that on the watch in itself because like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.080" end="00:45:20.830" style="s2">computer code has no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.390" end="00:45:23.590" style="s2">hurricanes are it has no idea what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.830" end="00:45:26.950" style="s2">real and is nobody but in that case</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.590" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">could have a designation that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.950" end="00:45:31.180" style="s2">that the National correct you can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:32.830" style="s2">can get data from third party sources</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.180" end="00:45:35.410" style="s2">and this is the thing that B else turns</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.830" end="00:45:36.910" style="s2">it into data exactly this is the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.410" end="00:45:38.650" style="s2">thing that a lot of applications are</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.910" end="00:45:41.080" style="s2">doing but the thing that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.650" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">keep in mind is that as soon as you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.080" end="00:45:46.210" style="s2">that a guru or smart contractor has no</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:48.070" style="s2">longer fully trust us right right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.210" end="00:45:52.900" style="s2">there&#39;s this concept which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.070" end="00:45:54.730" style="s2">utopian concept of a trustless legal</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.900" end="00:45:57.190" style="s2">system so that you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.730" end="00:45:59.320" style="s2">messiness of humans anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.190" end="00:46:01.690" style="s2">system and you can have complete faith</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.320" end="00:46:03.460" style="s2">and confidence in the contract that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.690" end="00:46:07.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve struck yeah right and like</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.460" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">outside of fruit like basically giving</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.060" end="00:46:11.320" style="s2">bounties for solving math problems so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:14.080" style="s2">gets not something that you can 100%</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.320" end="00:46:18.930" style="s2">achieve so I can&#39;t necessarily ensure my</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.080" end="00:46:23.410" style="s2">vacation that if if I go all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.930" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">Argentina and the weather is terrible it</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.410" end="00:46:27.640" style="s2">pays out because we can&#39;t agree what</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:30.430" style="s2">terrible weather is right like you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.640" end="00:46:32.710" style="s2">create structures bit made out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.430" end="00:46:35.890" style="s2">individual participants they can try to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.710" end="00:46:38.410" style="s2">and have aligned incentives to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.890" end="00:46:40.540" style="s2">people to kind of give to give correct</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.410" end="00:46:41.140" style="s2">results so and you can have complicated</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.540" end="00:46:42.609" style="s2">and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.140" end="00:46:43.960" style="s2">interruptions involving people giving</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.609" end="00:46:46.539" style="s2">different answers and policing each</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.960" end="00:46:47.950" style="s2">other and rewarding people who give the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.539" end="00:46:49.740" style="s2">same answer that other people have</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.950" end="00:46:53.319" style="s2">committed to and things like this but</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.740" end="00:46:56.650" style="s2">like you can only try to approach the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.319" end="00:46:58.690" style="s2">had like the idea of kind of correct</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.650" end="00:47:02.980" style="s2">truth like you can never 100% reach it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.690" end="00:47:06.819" style="s2">now you started aetherium in 2014-2015</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.980" end="00:47:07.960" style="s2">um started started end of 2013 I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.819" end="00:47:10.839" style="s2">watched in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.960" end="00:47:13.569" style="s2">okay would you say let&#39;s use launch date</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.839" end="00:47:16.900" style="s2">as an artificial sure date would you say</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.569" end="00:47:21.579" style="s2">you are more or less excited</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.900" end="00:47:23.410" style="s2">emotionally hmm then you were when it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.579" end="00:47:27.569" style="s2">started you&#39;ve now been through so</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.410" end="00:47:27.569" style="s2">you&#39;ve logged some miles here hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.059" end="00:47:37.630" style="s2">definitely definitely stay excited I</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.019" end="00:47:40.869" style="s2">worked I think the main difference is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.630" end="00:47:43.690" style="s2">kind of more like definitely a kinda</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.869" end="00:47:46.089" style="s2">excited in the sense of like four years</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.690" end="00:47:48.940" style="s2">well definite and like I kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.089" end="00:47:51.369" style="s2">opposed to indefinite like four years</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.940" end="00:47:54.130" style="s2">yeah four years ago was about like hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.369" end="00:47:56.200" style="s2">let&#39;s make this platform to kind of try</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.130" end="00:47:57.579" style="s2">really a bunch of really cool things we</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.200" end="00:48:00.039" style="s2">have no idea what&#39;s gonna happen and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.579" end="00:48:02.589" style="s2">let&#39;s just stick it out there and now</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.039" end="00:48:04.660" style="s2">like we know things about things and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.589" end="00:48:07.900" style="s2">people are already doing we know things</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.660" end="00:48:10.390" style="s2">about things that people wants to do on</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.900" end="00:48:13.269" style="s2">weekends we&#39;ll also know more about Nick</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.390" end="00:48:15.700" style="s2">what the limitations are and so instead</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.269" end="00:48:18.549" style="s2">of just being this kind of extremely</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.700" end="00:48:20.109" style="s2">fuzzy dream of like let&#39;s stick smart</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.549" end="00:48:22.509" style="s2">contracts and algorithms and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.109" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">trust us if I everything right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.509" end="00:48:31.390" style="s2">something that&#39;s kind of both more</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:34.269" style="s2">moderate but also kind of more like</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.390" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">seeming much more like it I like it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.269" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">actually has a big chance of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:41.019" style="s2">transforming the world and of precisely</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:44.230" style="s2">because that&#39;s when moderated to some</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.019" end="00:48:46.059" style="s2">extent so you more if I gave you a false</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.230" end="00:48:47.980" style="s2">three choices and by the way smart</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.059" end="00:48:50.200" style="s2">people always hate these things so feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.980" end="00:48:52.059" style="s2">free to break the model if I gave you a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.200" end="00:48:53.620" style="s2">choice between saying are you mostly</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.059" end="00:48:55.180" style="s2">excited about</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.620" end="00:48:57.730" style="s2">the technology and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.180" end="00:48:59.410" style="s2">innovation are you mostly excited about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.730" end="00:49:02.830" style="s2">the business opportunities for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.410" end="00:49:06.120" style="s2">or are you mostly excited about the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.830" end="00:49:08.740" style="s2">in which this could transform human life</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.120" end="00:49:11.560" style="s2">would you be that would that be an easy</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.740" end="00:49:14.140" style="s2">call or would you say I reject that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.560" end="00:49:19.840" style="s2">decision tree some mix over the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.140" end="00:49:21.550" style="s2">and the third mm no I just like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.840" end="00:49:23.620" style="s2">framing of business opportunities is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.550" end="00:49:26.800" style="s2">definitely kind of never ik like this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.620" end="00:49:28.510" style="s2">weird I mean the despite and it even I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">get the sense that you don&#39;t love money</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.510" end="00:49:34.870" style="s2">enough yeah this is true</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:36.910" style="s2">okay hmm I mean it&#39;s weird because I for</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.870" end="00:49:38.320" style="s2">a long time you have a lot of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.910" end="00:49:40.570" style="s2">well I have a lot of it and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.320" end="00:49:43.630" style="s2">even weirder because I like for a long</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.570" end="00:49:45.700" style="s2">time I subscribed so this kind of branch</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.630" end="00:49:47.530" style="s2">of economics that basically says that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.700" end="00:49:49.780" style="s2">like love of money is like the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.530" end="00:49:56.080" style="s2">motivation for B vote for people to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.780" end="00:49:59.290" style="s2">an Randian um well in I&#39;d say in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.080" end="00:50:01.210" style="s2">area but it&#39;s but I don&#39;t get that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.290" end="00:50:04.150" style="s2">be honest I just don&#39;t get that vibe</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.210" end="00:50:06.310" style="s2">right I mean there&#39;s I&#39;ve definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.150" end="00:50:09.250" style="s2">kind of shifted a lot over the years I</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.310" end="00:50:11.290" style="s2">think my experience even within the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.250" end="00:50:13.960" style="s2">crypto space itself has kind of trend</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.290" end="00:50:19.630" style="s2">and given me a lot of new information to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.960" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">work with more like the this basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.630" end="00:50:25.510" style="s2">and then this goes back to this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:31.350" style="s2">cryptocurrencies as a microcosm of wider</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.510" end="00:50:34.900" style="s2">society thing right like if you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.350" end="00:50:37.600" style="s2">basically any like any movements</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.900" end="00:50:39.310" style="s2">regardless of like what what the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.600" end="00:50:40.810" style="s2">movement is for or what its goals are to</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.310" end="00:50:42.820" style="s2">be succeed it needs to be sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.810" end="00:50:44.950" style="s2">big and once something is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.820" end="00:50:46.330" style="s2">big it needs to have internal structure</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.950" end="00:50:49.000" style="s2">to a coordinated energy of its</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.330" end="00:50:50.730" style="s2">objectives which means that it suffers</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.000" end="00:50:53.650" style="s2">from governance issues it suffers from</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.730" end="00:50:57.670" style="s2">public goods the issue is it suffers</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.650" end="00:51:00.670" style="s2">from conflicts with adjacent movements</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.670" end="00:51:03.790" style="s2">and suffers from conflicts between its</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.670" end="00:51:05.770" style="s2">own values and its and its own desire to</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.790" end="00:51:06.940" style="s2">succeed and so on and so forth and like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.770" end="00:51:10.270" style="s2">it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.940" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">come up with ways to answer like</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.270" end="00:51:14.109" style="s2">basically almost the same kinds of hard</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.849" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">problems at the world as a whole is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.109" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">working on well you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:22.839" style="s2">interesting when I look at this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:24.700" style="s2">world of people maybe had an epicenter</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.839" end="00:51:27.849" style="s2">in the Bay Area though I think it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.700" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">true now we&#39;re trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.849" end="00:51:34.650" style="s2">is the future and how do we get there</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:37.349" style="s2">there&#39;s a very clear sense that people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.650" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">creativity and their intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.349" end="00:51:44.170" style="s2">correlated with their financial success</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s not very tight and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.170" end="00:51:48.970" style="s2">like an embarrassment that well that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:50.920" style="s2">person is super amazing and then mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.970" end="00:51:53.770" style="s2">not doing all that well this person</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.920" end="00:51:56.410" style="s2">somehow metabolizing amend this amount</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.770" end="00:51:58.359" style="s2">this is something that I&#39;ve definitely</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.410" end="00:52:01.150" style="s2">have realized just from one of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.359" end="00:52:03.250" style="s2">travels like I&#39;ve interacted with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.150" end="00:52:04.750" style="s2">of kind of super famous people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.250" end="00:52:07.089" style="s2">different kinds of positions which</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.750" end="00:52:08.920" style="s2">includes like some world leaders and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.089" end="00:52:13.240" style="s2">includes some kind of leaders of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.920" end="00:52:16.390" style="s2">fields in cryptography and it in you</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.240" end="00:52:19.690" style="s2">realize that like people in these</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.390" end="00:52:22.210" style="s2">positions they are impressive but</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.690" end="00:52:24.700" style="s2">they&#39;re not like super amazing godlike</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.210" end="00:52:26.109" style="s2">impressive right something tomorrow some</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.700" end="00:52:27.849" style="s2">of them are but then there&#39;s also super</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.109" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">amazing godlike impressive people that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.849" end="00:52:30.970" style="s2">just like don&#39;t get written get that</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:34.180" style="s2">much shit I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.970" end="00:52:37.539" style="s2">to get at I think about like if you hang</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.180" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">around with musicians very often you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.539" end="00:52:40.270" style="s2">have some buddies a super famous</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">musician saying you want to who&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.270" end="00:52:44.730" style="s2">good and they&#39;ll tell you some of you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:48.819" style="s2">never heard of a musician&#39;s musician</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.730" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">exactly this yes right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.819" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">if I if I gave the name of people who</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:56.829" style="s2">are famous for being let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.529" style="s2">physicists they&#39;re very often the people</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.829" end="00:53:01.240" style="s2">on television as physicists mm-hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.529" end="00:53:03.130" style="s2">they would all point to some guy who</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.240" end="00:53:04.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give a lot of interviews and say</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.130" end="00:53:09.210" style="s2">well that&#39;s the top guy exactly like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.930" end="00:53:13.150" style="s2">basically the social status like is</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.210" end="00:53:15.789" style="s2">predicted by confidence multiplied by</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.150" end="00:53:18.910" style="s2">like basically publicity skill and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.789" end="00:53:20.590" style="s2">that&#39;s half correlated with competence</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.910" end="00:53:21.640" style="s2">for obvious reasons right like those</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.590" end="00:53:22.930" style="s2">people also know the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.640" end="00:53:24.010" style="s2">the real confidence and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.930" end="00:53:25.990" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve always found really</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.010" end="00:53:28.900" style="s2">interesting about people who have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.990" end="00:53:32.860" style="s2">diehard belief that markets produce</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.900" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">justice which is I do think that success</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.860" end="00:53:41.950" style="s2">in markets is somewhat correlated or has</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:44.050" style="s2">been with things like productivity but</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.950" end="00:53:46.270" style="s2">it&#39;s also correlated sometimes with how</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.050" end="00:53:48.340" style="s2">predatory somebody can be or you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.270" end="00:53:51.460" style="s2">how lucky they happen to be at a</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.340" end="00:53:55.600" style="s2">particular moment and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.460" end="00:53:57.220" style="s2">questions that I have is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.600" end="00:53:59.170" style="s2">really interested in innovation which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.220" end="00:54:03.250" style="s2">what I sort of pick up is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.170" end="00:54:06.910" style="s2">main things how does something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.250" end="00:54:10.660" style="s2">aetherium give us a possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.910" end="00:54:12.760" style="s2">revitalize innovation after what many of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.660" end="00:54:15.900" style="s2">us consider a period of relative</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.760" end="00:54:17.740" style="s2">stagnancy outside of the areas of</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.900" end="00:54:21.310" style="s2">computation communication which</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.740" end="00:54:24.850" style="s2">everybody knows have exploded hmm do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.310" end="00:54:30.660" style="s2">think about how if cerium can mediate a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.850" end="00:54:30.660" style="s2">new Renaissance a new generative age</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.260" end="00:54:38.410" style="s2">about it a little bit definitely and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.060" end="00:54:42.970" style="s2">think I mean there&#39;s an of etherium as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.410" end="00:54:44.650" style="s2">platform for experiments in governance</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.970" end="00:54:47.740" style="s2">and public goods funding is one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.650" end="00:54:50.350" style="s2">mentioned and education is another thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.740" end="00:54:52.360" style="s2">that I end of talk about in the end</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.350" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">obviously we do I mean I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.360" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">these blog posts on Vitalik dossier in</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:55:00.970" style="s2">other forums and like they&#39;re one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">big challenges that a for example is</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.970" end="00:55:06.430" style="s2">that like for in and if internet</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.140" style="s2">educational resources in general there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.430" end="00:55:10.900" style="s2">basically two kinds right there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.140" end="00:55:13.270" style="s2">papers and I Wikipedia and like</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.900" end="00:55:14.950" style="s2">basically things that are technically</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.270" end="00:55:17.590" style="s2">accurate but they&#39;re just not core ibly</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.950" end="00:55:19.600" style="s2">not understand understandable at all and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.590" end="00:55:21.280" style="s2">we should not be forcing people to even</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.600" end="00:55:23.380" style="s2">try reading them and then there&#39;s pop</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:25.870" style="s2">side literature which is very accessible</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.380" end="00:55:28.540" style="s2">but it&#39;s often just actively wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.870" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">really horrible ways and okay I</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.540" end="00:55:32.920" style="s2">personally even before a theorem like I</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.490" end="00:55:53.589" style="s2">important in part because like I view</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.569" end="00:55:55.990" style="s2">accessibility of information about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.589" end="00:55:58.210" style="s2">technology as a precondition for even</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.990" end="00:55:59.950" style="s2">the decentralization of the space like</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.210" end="00:56:01.720" style="s2">if the thing technically runs on fifty</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.950" end="00:56:03.039" style="s2">thousand computers but only forty two</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.720" end="00:56:04.660" style="s2">people know how it works and your</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.039" end="00:56:07.960" style="s2">decentralization indexes and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.660" end="00:56:10.450" style="s2">thousand it&#39;s 42 you know and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.960" end="00:56:15.549" style="s2">a very nice point yeah and so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.450" end="00:56:17.140" style="s2">kind of improve like even how we in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.549" end="00:56:20.019" style="s2">etherium community and if work on</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.140" end="00:56:23.470" style="s2">innovation internally but so those are</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.019" end="00:56:27.700" style="s2">kind of things that and if that happened</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.470" end="00:56:29.529" style="s2">in blockchains as a novella as a lab for</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.700" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">trying out new things kind of first for</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.529" end="00:56:33.789" style="s2">the blockchain space and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:35.890" style="s2">potentially export it to other things</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.789" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">and then we can also look at head of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.890" end="00:56:41.769" style="s2">block chains as something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:45.490" style="s2">used to improve and create better</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.769" end="00:56:48.069" style="s2">institutions so like one of the etherium</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.490" end="00:56:50.589" style="s2">foundations researchers vlad sam fear he</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.069" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">actually got into aetherium because he</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.589" end="00:56:55.569" style="s2">was looking at how to improve academic</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:57.099" style="s2">publishing and like he saw things like</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.569" end="00:56:59.890" style="s2">you know the existing peer review</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.099" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">mechanisms and how they were just a very</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.890" end="00:57:05.259" style="s2">flawed in a bunch of ways and he thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:07.150" style="s2">that like hey here&#39;s potentially apply</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.259" end="00:57:09.309" style="s2">form that we could use to build</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.150" end="00:57:12.369" style="s2">something that does better and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.309" end="00:57:15.039" style="s2">that&#39;s one of his core interests and why</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.369" end="00:57:17.410" style="s2">he is even continuing to work on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.039" end="00:57:20.170" style="s2">technology you know i hadn&#39;t understood</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.410" end="00:57:22.750" style="s2">how insiders viewed peer review in an</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.170" end="00:57:25.569" style="s2">academic context until he finance</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.750" end="00:57:28.509" style="s2">professor got drunk at a party and said</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.569" end="00:57:31.180" style="s2">you know that guy who&#39;s harassing you in</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.509" end="00:57:32.829" style="s2">your research in finance you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.180" end="00:57:34.869" style="s2">why he&#39;s doing i said well why do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.829" end="00:57:37.390" style="s2">think he&#39;s doing so i know he says we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.869" end="00:57:41.279" style="s2">created a system where our fees are</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.390" end="00:57:44.470" style="s2">sky-high to consult and we do this by</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.279" end="00:57:47.470" style="s2">making the number of professors in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.470" end="00:57:49.090" style="s2">field small by controlling peer review</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.470" end="00:57:50.680" style="s2">and so that effectively we are at</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.090" end="00:57:54.369" style="s2">conspiracy in restraint like this guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.680" end="00:57:56.109" style="s2">just telling me straight out that this</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.369" end="00:57:58.510" style="s2">is a gating function to keep their</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.109" end="00:58:00.520" style="s2">consulting fees high and that this guy</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.510" end="00:58:02.619" style="s2">is gonna do everything that they tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.520" end="00:58:04.119" style="s2">him to do because otherwise he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.619" end="00:58:07.210" style="s2">come into the club and charge these</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.119" end="00:58:09.849" style="s2">rates that sounds about right</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.210" end="00:58:11.349" style="s2">right so that one of the app another</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.849" end="00:58:13.570" style="s2">killer application so you have one</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.349" end="00:58:15.570" style="s2">potential suite of applications which</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.570" end="00:58:18.670" style="s2">have to do with facilitating illegality</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.570" end="00:58:20.920" style="s2">some of that might regard result in net</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.670" end="00:58:24.160" style="s2">reduction of harm because you could</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.920" end="00:58:27.940" style="s2">replace violence with math yes on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.160" end="00:58:31.420" style="s2">other hand a place where you could have</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.940" end="00:58:36.790" style="s2">a really positive effect is political</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.420" end="00:58:40.990" style="s2">economy where by removing the human</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.790" end="00:58:43.270" style="s2">ability to act badly you effectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.990" end="00:58:47.890" style="s2">create a much fairer more representative</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.270" end="00:58:50.500" style="s2">world exactly you know what do we do so</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.890" end="00:58:53.050" style="s2">you have an interest in in the two</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">fields I find Wikipedia can&#39;t explain to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.050" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">any normal human being our theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">math and physics even biology you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:03.910" style="s2">sort of guess what&#39;s going on because</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:06.580" style="s2">you have something concrete but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.910" end="00:59:08.170" style="s2">even biology like you gotta learn math</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.580" end="00:59:10.150" style="s2">the deeply crockett because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.170" end="00:59:14.050" style="s2">you&#39;re just memorizing like names of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.150" end="00:59:16.660" style="s2">chemicals well but you could my here I</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.050" end="00:59:21.609" style="s2">have a PhD in math if I try to read a</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.660" end="00:59:24.430" style="s2">math paper one or two fields over from</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.609" end="00:59:26.770" style="s2">my own field right I will do less well</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.430" end="00:59:28.570" style="s2">with it than if I read a biology paper</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.770" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">and even though I&#39;ve taken no class in</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.570" end="00:59:35.530" style="s2">biology that sounds right yeah yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:37.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between the level</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.530" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">of math that you have to know it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.510" end="00:59:44.020" style="s2">just because it&#39;s importance for you as</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">a philosopher and then and look that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.020" end="00:59:47.770" style="s2">about the level of math that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:49.300" style="s2">need even to tip you go to biology to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.770" end="00:59:52.420" style="s2">good at economics to be good at a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.300" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">things right it&#39;s understanding like</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.420" end="00:59:57.130" style="s2">principles even things like for example</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="00:59:59.440" style="s2">if you have a trade-off between x and y</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.130" end="01:00:01.240" style="s2">and right now you&#39;re optimizing entirely</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.440" end="01:00:03.490" style="s2">for x and it&#39;s a smooth curve</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.240" end="01:00:04.900" style="s2">then if he wants a little bit of Y then</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.490" end="01:00:06.940" style="s2">you can get your first bit of Y at</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.900" end="01:00:09.940" style="s2">almost like zero cost of X right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.940" end="01:00:12.430" style="s2">that&#39;s just a prop like it&#39;s a property</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.940" end="01:00:13.960" style="s2">of continuous functions that like from</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.430" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">the maximum of the derivative starts at</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.960" end="01:00:19.990" style="s2">zero you know if you kind of just deeply</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:21.970" style="s2">kind of mentally grok about like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.990" end="01:00:23.290" style="s2">couple hundred of these facts to see</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.970" end="01:00:25.360" style="s2">where you&#39;re deeply kind of mentally</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.290" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">grow up like how to walk then like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.360" end="01:00:30.010" style="s2">get a lot but then from there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:32.410" style="s2">also like the frontiers and often I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.010" end="01:00:34.090" style="s2">the frontiers were most important well</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.410" end="01:00:36.280" style="s2">so here&#39;s a weird thing I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.090" end="01:00:37.750" style="s2">to bring up when I try to understand</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.280" end="01:00:40.680" style="s2">crypto as a space</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.750" end="01:00:43.600" style="s2">I&#39;m always confronted by how incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.680" end="01:00:46.390" style="s2">Byzantine and impossible it is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.600" end="01:00:48.369" style="s2">understand all of the acronyms all of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.390" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">the sub pieces of history I mean it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.369" end="01:00:56.650" style="s2">incredibly fragmented experience in</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:01:02.280" style="s2">which I spend a long period of time just</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.650" end="01:01:05.290" style="s2">feeling moronic isn&#39;t it odd that like</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.280" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">etherium itself suffers from this this</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.290" end="01:01:09.420" style="s2">problem it&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:12.580" style="s2">on yeah it&#39;s definitely something that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.420" end="01:01:15.220" style="s2">we wants to fix so if I mean if you ever</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.580" end="01:01:16.540" style="s2">have suggestions on like what</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.220" end="01:01:18.010" style="s2">specifically we could make more</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.540" end="01:01:21.520" style="s2">understandable I&#39;m always happy to hear</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.010" end="01:01:23.700" style="s2">those fantastic now one thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.520" end="01:01:27.190" style="s2">think is really interesting is this</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.700" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">episode that occurred in the etherium</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.190" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">space in which you are faced with a very</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">serious question of leadership having to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:43.030" style="s2">do with an emergency that you could have</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:45.100" style="s2">either allowed to follow the rules that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.030" end="01:01:48.850" style="s2">had been previously specified in some</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.100" end="01:01:50.650" style="s2">sense or could where you could interject</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.850" end="01:01:53.140" style="s2">a certain amount of human intervention</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.650" end="01:01:57.130" style="s2">but thereby letting people know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.140" end="01:01:59.859" style="s2">this was to some extent not mediated</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.130" end="01:02:01.270" style="s2">only by rules and computers can you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.859" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">you say a little bit about this famous</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.270" end="01:02:07.660" style="s2">incident and sure so in 2016 there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:11.050" style="s2">this smart contract that a group called</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.660" end="01:02:13.050" style="s2">salokya launched called the dao and do</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.050" end="01:02:15.040" style="s2">stands for a decentralized autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.050" end="01:02:17.110" style="s2">organization and said to her my team</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.040" end="01:02:19.840" style="s2">with about three years before and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.110" end="01:02:21.580" style="s2">basically means that maybe you can have</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.840" end="01:02:24.850" style="s2">a smart contract to this computer</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.580" end="01:02:27.130" style="s2">program that controls digital assets and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.850" end="01:02:30.280" style="s2">if encode a set of rules for an</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.130" end="01:02:31.930" style="s2">organization and like you can use this</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.280" end="01:02:33.580" style="s2">kind of smart contract basically as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.930" end="01:02:36.430" style="s2">replacement for things like companies</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.580" end="01:02:39.970" style="s2">and so some I could decide to launch a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.430" end="01:02:42.610" style="s2">Dao and their Dao was intended to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.970" end="01:02:47.080" style="s2">basically a decentralized to BC fund so</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.610" end="01:02:48.970" style="s2">people could apply the Dao would vote on</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.080" end="01:02:51.610" style="s2">which projects were worth investing in</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.970" end="01:02:57.130" style="s2">so leaderless rule-based yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.610" end="01:02:59.740" style="s2">virtual exactly it was the hit hit all</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.130" end="01:03:02.320" style="s2">the cypherpunk notes that they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.740" end="01:03:04.810" style="s2">right place okay and the thing launched</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.320" end="01:03:07.360" style="s2">and we were all expecting it</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.810" end="01:03:10.000" style="s2">during its kind of initial fundraising</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.360" end="01:03:12.460" style="s2">phase which was also like an open public</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.000" end="01:03:14.950" style="s2">blockchain process and to maybe get five</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.460" end="01:03:17.770" style="s2">million dollars but then it got five and</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.950" end="01:03:20.020" style="s2">it got ten and I got twenty I got 50 and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.770" end="01:03:24.250" style="s2">100 and then the price of youth went up</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.020" end="01:03:26.710" style="s2">and it got 200 and then when I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.250" end="01:03:29.130" style="s2">sitting at AF friends was it all</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.710" end="01:03:31.990" style="s2">alarming that it was so successful</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.130" end="01:03:33.970" style="s2">after the 50 mark I definitely have</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.990" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">switched from excitement&#39;s to deep</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.970" end="01:03:38.050" style="s2">apprehension but you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:41.530" style="s2">contract if you lid on that that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.050" end="01:03:45.310" style="s2">were feeling that way a bit okay yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.530" end="01:03:47.650" style="s2">on a June 17 2016 and when I was in</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.310" end="01:03:52.930" style="s2">Shanghai at a a friend&#39;s apartment and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.650" end="01:03:57.670" style="s2">it was about fifteen thirty something in</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.930" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">the afternoon I saw a message in one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.670" end="01:04:02.350" style="s2">the Skype chats that it was that I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:03.970" style="s2">in and someone basically was saying hey</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.350" end="01:04:05.350" style="s2">guys look at the Dow it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.970" end="01:04:08.770" style="s2">there&#39;s some money coming out of it and</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.350" end="01:04:12.070" style="s2">so I checked on the public black</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.770" end="01:04:14.350" style="s2">Explorer on the blockchain and I saw oh</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.070" end="01:04:16.570" style="s2">look they it seems like about two</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.350" end="01:04:19.420" style="s2">million dollar has actually already been</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.570" end="01:04:21.670" style="s2">removed from the Dow and more ethos and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.420" end="01:04:24.370" style="s2">of slowly being drained over time and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.670" end="01:04:26.840" style="s2">I pinged the core developers and I asked</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.370" end="01:04:30.050" style="s2">hey is this normal and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.840" end="01:04:31.700" style="s2">at first I was thinking okay the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.050" end="01:04:33.530" style="s2">alternative is unthinkable there has to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.700" end="01:04:36.650" style="s2">be a reasonable explanation for this</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.530" end="01:04:41.390" style="s2">and so you were locked into some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.650" end="01:04:44.390" style="s2">denial for the beginning yes and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.390" end="01:04:46.520" style="s2">developers looked at it and over the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.390" end="01:04:48.530" style="s2">next half-hour as more and more people</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.520" end="01:04:50.570" style="s2">came online and started chattering with</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.530" end="01:04:52.940" style="s2">each other it became clear that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.570" end="01:04:57.080" style="s2">unthinkable has actually happened</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.940" end="01:05:01.010" style="s2">and I actually burned about 20 of my own</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.080" end="01:05:03.230" style="s2">II like basically just tossing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.010" end="01:05:04.940" style="s2">ethereum blockchain in itself and just</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.230" end="01:05:06.860" style="s2">spamming it with transactions to try to</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.940" end="01:05:08.990" style="s2">and have slowed the attacker I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.860" end="01:05:10.580" style="s2">is denial of service yeah yeah just spam</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.990" end="01:05:13.010" style="s2">the blockchain with transact not all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.580" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">my listeners will know the terms okay so</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.010" end="01:05:16.250" style="s2">that the attackers transactions could</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.960" end="01:05:17.840" style="s2">not get in as quickly because the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.250" end="01:05:20.210" style="s2">attackers transact the attacker could</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.840" end="01:05:21.710" style="s2">only withdraw something like a couple</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.210" end="01:05:24.200" style="s2">hundred eath with every transaction so</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.710" end="01:05:26.840" style="s2">it was a slow process like in the hopes</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.200" end="01:05:28.430" style="s2">that the developers would find some way</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.840" end="01:05:30.710" style="s2">to play with a little intentional</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.430" end="01:05:32.630" style="s2">inefficiency or was just that it was it</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.710" end="01:05:34.700" style="s2">was not intentional so in some weird way</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.630" end="01:05:36.080" style="s2">the inefficiency was a good yes it gets</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.700" end="01:05:37.700" style="s2">even weirder there was an even bigger</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.080" end="01:05:41.840" style="s2">and efficiency that would that would</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.700" end="01:05:44.330" style="s2">prove to be an even better thing so but</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.840" end="01:05:46.610" style="s2">then the developers however did not find</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.330" end="01:05:49.430" style="s2">a way to plug the hole but the attacker</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.610" end="01:05:51.950" style="s2">voluntarily stopped after stealing about</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.430" end="01:05:54.260" style="s2">4 million eath from the dough but in any</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.950" end="01:05:57.230" style="s2">case the this is a second in efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.260" end="01:05:59.930" style="s2">right voluntarily stopped yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.230" end="01:06:05.990" style="s2">request made no no as in the attacker</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.930" end="01:06:07.670" style="s2">just stopped okay and end so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.990" end="01:06:10.730" style="s2">second and bigger in efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.670" end="01:06:13.340" style="s2">the money that was the attacker took out</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.730" end="01:06:15.590" style="s2">the four million es it did not go into</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.340" end="01:06:18.320" style="s2">the attackers wallet immediately instead</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.590" end="01:06:20.990" style="s2">it went into a child smart contract and</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.320" end="01:06:23.150" style="s2">only after 35 days could the attacker</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.990" end="01:06:25.120" style="s2">actually take that money out and this</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.150" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">was child smart contract you mean a</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.120" end="01:06:31.040" style="s2">separate smart contract that was created</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:34.460" style="s2">through a function call of the main Dao</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.040" end="01:06:36.920" style="s2">smart contract okay so this was also not</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.460" end="01:06:39.980" style="s2">intended right it was just like a random</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.920" end="01:06:41.990" style="s2">quirk of this of fate that</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.980" end="01:06:44.000" style="s2">there was this big bug that was the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.990" end="01:06:46.340" style="s2">biggest smart contract theft in history</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.000" end="01:06:49.700" style="s2">up until that point and it put the money</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.340" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">into this convenient box where just stay</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.700" end="01:06:54.100" style="s2">conveniently locked for 35 days where</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:59.560" style="s2">everyone could stare and look at it oh</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.100" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">yeah and the soon after this there were</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.560" end="01:07:04.550" style="s2">calls happening between core developers</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:07.970" style="s2">and the proposal to remedy the situation</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.550" end="01:07:10.310" style="s2">with a blockchain fork I came into play</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.970" end="01:07:12.860" style="s2">right so basically what happened here is</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.310" end="01:07:15.410" style="s2">the it was a blockchain fork an</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.860" end="01:07:19.220" style="s2">emotional issue for this community yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.410" end="01:07:20.990" style="s2">so why is it so what I guess first of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.220" end="01:07:24.140" style="s2">all what is it exactly so explain what</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.990" end="01:07:25.820" style="s2">what would happen so in general a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.140" end="01:07:29.060" style="s2">blockchain for Kisan normal process</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.820" end="01:07:30.920" style="s2">right you have an upgrade and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.060" end="01:07:33.080" style="s2">developers of the etherium clients</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.920" end="01:07:36.380" style="s2">implement code that basically says after</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.080" end="01:07:38.780" style="s2">block number four three seven zero zero</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.380" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">zero zero stop processing blocks</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.780" end="01:07:41.630" style="s2">according to the old rules start</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:43.250" style="s2">processing blocks according to the new</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.630" end="01:07:47.240" style="s2">rules which have extra features attached</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.250" end="01:07:50.950" style="s2">and your blocks are just said packages</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.240" end="01:07:56.690" style="s2">of transactions yeah okay and bees and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.950" end="01:07:58.970" style="s2">so ever before this sub I know these</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.690" end="01:08:01.130" style="s2">code patches are formally proposed there</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.970" end="01:08:02.750" style="s2">is this month-long period of mini month</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.130" end="01:08:05.060" style="s2">long period of deliberation we are</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.750" end="01:08:08.120" style="s2">changes or proposed people discuss them</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.060" end="01:08:09.950" style="s2">people talk about them and generally</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.120" end="01:08:12.440" style="s2">it&#39;s agreed that these changes are good</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.950" end="01:08:14.150" style="s2">and so people just go and download the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.440" end="01:08:16.220" style="s2">code and because everyone&#39;s downloaded</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.150" end="01:08:17.510" style="s2">the code the block chain after block</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.220" end="01:08:19.070" style="s2">four three seven zero zero zero zero</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.510" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">follows these difference in better it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.070" end="01:08:24.140" style="s2">a very warm and very human process yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:30.140" style="s2">called logic of a machine exactly</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.140" end="01:08:32.260" style="s2">elements and so the dal fork it was also</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.140" end="01:08:34.430" style="s2">a fork it was also a code change</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.260" end="01:08:38.570" style="s2">implemented by the developers of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.430" end="01:08:41.630" style="s2">clients that is it was pushed out</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.570" end="01:08:43.550" style="s2">through a new version of the different</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.630" end="01:08:45.890" style="s2">clients that people could download and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.550" end="01:08:49.340" style="s2">users went ahead and voluntarily</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.890" end="01:08:50.780" style="s2">downloaded it and it would basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.340" end="01:08:52.880" style="s2">change the rules of the blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.780" end="01:08:53.480" style="s2">except instead of changing them for a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.880" end="01:08:55.850" style="s2">permanent</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.480" end="01:08:58.070" style="s2">it would only do what a single one time</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.850" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">change and the single one time change</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.070" end="01:09:03.710" style="s2">basically said during block one one nine</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:06.590" style="s2">two zero zero zero zero before</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.710" end="01:09:09.980" style="s2">processing any transactions take the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.590" end="01:09:11.780" style="s2">ether that stuck in the this child</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.980" end="01:09:13.730" style="s2">contract and move it into another</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.780" end="01:09:17.810" style="s2">contract that could then basically</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.730" end="01:09:19.910" style="s2">refund it all to the victims and so this</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.810" end="01:09:22.850" style="s2">was a very kind of manual intervention</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.910" end="01:09:25.330" style="s2">right it basically says like we all</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.850" end="01:09:27.410" style="s2">agree it&#39;s a run code that just</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.330" end="01:09:29.180" style="s2">irregularly takes this money and just</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.410" end="01:09:32.330" style="s2">reassigns it so that&#39;s other thing so</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.180" end="01:09:34.460" style="s2">the the it&#39;s very weird because you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.330" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">we always think in like a sci-fi movie</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.460" end="01:09:39.800" style="s2">that some thing that you think is human</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:42.320" style="s2">would rip off its mask and reveal itself</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.800" end="01:09:44.510" style="s2">to be a computer and this is the reverse</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.320" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">exactly pewter face is ripped off</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.510" end="01:09:50.870" style="s2">revealing humans behind this this</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">technological stack yes and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.870" end="01:09:56.780" style="s2">ultimately like people talk about head</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.120" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">of blockchain immutability and like this</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.780" end="01:10:00.860" style="s2">is this idea that basically you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:03.170" style="s2">supposed to do this sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.860" end="01:10:05.900" style="s2">where does that supposed to come from</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.170" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">exactly it so like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.900" end="01:10:09.830" style="s2">definitely a sense in which it exists</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.000" end="01:10:11.180" style="s2">technologically because like actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.830" end="01:10:14.390" style="s2">pulling off one of these Forks is</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.180" end="01:10:16.130" style="s2">incredibly hard and for example if it</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.390" end="01:10:18.290" style="s2">was not the case that the money was</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.130" end="01:10:20.570" style="s2">conveniently stuck there and one nice</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.290" end="01:10:22.070" style="s2">little address for 35 days it would</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.570" end="01:10:24.200" style="s2">basically not have been possible to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.070" end="01:10:26.270" style="s2">it right because when as soon as you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.200" end="01:10:27.620" style="s2">announced this protocol change that says</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.270" end="01:10:29.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna take money out of here put</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.620" end="01:10:30.470" style="s2">it in there the attacker could just</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:33.350" style="s2">moved the money from there to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.470" end="01:10:34.760" style="s2">different address and basically we play</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.350" end="01:10:37.340" style="s2">this cat-and-mouse game and the attacker</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.760" end="01:10:39.740" style="s2">could win but sometimes there is this</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.340" end="01:10:41.900" style="s2">possibility where you knew you up so we</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.740" end="01:10:44.840" style="s2">can just like do these interventions and</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.900" end="01:10:46.190" style="s2">you can just decide to stop writing this</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.840" end="01:10:50.450" style="s2">code and start running this other code</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.190" end="01:10:52.970" style="s2">and the only reason why this is not done</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.450" end="01:10:55.310" style="s2">more frequently is basically because</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.970" end="01:10:57.710" style="s2">their existing norms right in there</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.310" end="01:10:59.600" style="s2">exist norms in the blockchain community</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.710" end="01:11:01.910" style="s2">Avalon Zamfir the researcher I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.600" end="01:11:05.630" style="s2">before and if calls them a Szabo&#39;s Ally</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.910" end="01:11:07.250" style="s2">and named after nick szabo and in mixed</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.630" end="01:11:08.660" style="s2">sample actually just likes the moniker</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.250" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">suppose a lot like it is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.660" end="01:11:12.590" style="s2">accurate representation of kind of his</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:14.030" style="s2">beliefs which is and the beliefs of many</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.590" end="01:11:17.660" style="s2">in the crypto community which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.030" end="01:11:20.270" style="s2">basically that like even though it</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.660" end="01:11:22.370" style="s2">technically is code run by humans we</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.270" end="01:11:25.370" style="s2">should act as though it is code not run</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.370" end="01:11:27.530" style="s2">by humans and look because the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.370" end="01:11:29.660" style="s2">decisional gold right gold is not run by</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.530" end="01:11:31.520" style="s2">humans gold is gold and so if we want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.660" end="01:11:33.590" style="s2">make something that is a light gold then</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.520" end="01:11:35.000" style="s2">even though we&#39;re unfortunately stuck</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.590" end="01:11:36.740" style="s2">with this thing run by humans we should</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.000" end="01:11:39.470" style="s2">watch try as hard as we can to pretend</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.740" end="01:11:41.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not and like this was the ideology</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.470" end="01:11:43.460" style="s2">of a lot of people in this space and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.060" end="01:11:47.000" style="s2">dal fork very much went against this</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.460" end="01:11:51.320" style="s2">ideology and so even though in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.000" end="01:11:53.030" style="s2">opinion like having norms like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.320" end="01:11:56.120" style="s2">just like go and edit whatever you want</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.030" end="01:11:58.100" style="s2">is valuable but like when so such a</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.120" end="01:11:59.870" style="s2">large fraction of the ecosystem is at</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.100" end="01:12:02.390" style="s2">stake it&#39;s worth rethinking things but</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.870" end="01:12:04.520" style="s2">like other people were and if even more</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.390" end="01:12:06.490" style="s2">rigid in this regard and so there was</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.520" end="01:12:09.380" style="s2">this kind of split in the community and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.490" end="01:12:11.090" style="s2">a portion of the community actually did</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.380" end="01:12:13.190" style="s2">not download the updates right a portion</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.090" end="01:12:14.840" style="s2">of the community did not download these</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.190" end="01:12:17.000" style="s2">code patches and implement the fork and</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.840" end="01:12:19.400" style="s2">they just said we will continue running</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.000" end="01:12:21.680" style="s2">our own our old chain and the old chain</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.400" end="01:12:25.400" style="s2">has since then been called aetherium</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.680" end="01:12:29.750" style="s2">classic and it runs to this day this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.400" end="01:12:32.990" style="s2">a fascinating civil war in essence yes</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.750" end="01:12:34.760" style="s2">and what I get out of this is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.990" end="01:12:37.130" style="s2">there&#39;s this very weird thing which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.760" end="01:12:39.860" style="s2">that people get very attached to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.130" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">ideologies and then they come to</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.860" end="01:12:45.710" style="s2">understand why the simplistic version of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:48.740" style="s2">that ideology can&#39;t possibly work in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.710" end="01:12:50.420" style="s2">warm human system I watched this it you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.740" end="01:12:52.700" style="s2">have you ever gone to this festival</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.420" end="01:12:54.740" style="s2">called a femoral which is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.700" end="01:12:56.450" style="s2">Burning Man on the water that was I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.740" end="01:12:58.340" style="s2">part of it and I got invited to it but I</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.450" end="01:13:00.860" style="s2">haven&#39;t had the chance to go yet so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.340" end="01:13:03.950" style="s2">kind of a libertarian Waterworld in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.860" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">Sacramento Delta and what was</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.950" end="01:13:09.440" style="s2">interesting is is that one year in order</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.420" style="s2">to come to the festival you had to have</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">a lecture and you had to agree that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.420" end="01:13:14.750" style="s2">would receive the lecture because of</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:16.490" style="s2">problems that had happened the previous</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.750" end="01:13:20.530" style="s2">year and you realize that these</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.490" end="01:13:23.469" style="s2">libertarians were being forced to invent</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.530" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">permanence and rather than just anarchy</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.469" end="01:13:29.139" style="s2">you had to have some organized system</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:32.380" style="s2">and so one of my questions is is that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.139" end="01:13:37.929" style="s2">that dream of escape from the heavy hand</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.380" end="01:13:41.320" style="s2">of government effectively not something</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.929" end="01:13:43.179" style="s2">to be pursued inside of crypto space for</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.320" end="01:13:45.219" style="s2">the most part because we realized that</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.179" end="01:13:46.809" style="s2">it is going to require governance and</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.219" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">that we can&#39;t figure out a way to turn</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.809" end="01:13:53.320" style="s2">this into a completely cold and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:55.059" style="s2">methodical process it depends on which</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.320" end="01:13:57.400" style="s2">version of the dream you subscribe to I</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.059" end="01:13:59.739" style="s2">think the if the version of the dream</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.400" end="01:14:03.369" style="s2">you subscribe to is the dream that says</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.739" end="01:14:06.820" style="s2">that we can finally use algorithms to I</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.369" end="01:14:11.230" style="s2">basically completely eliminate humans</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.820" end="01:14:14.380" style="s2">ability to interfere in things then like</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.230" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">if your goal is to seen that enforced</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.380" end="01:14:21.880" style="s2">100% then like no you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:24.969" style="s2">get that if your dream is that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.880" end="01:14:26.860" style="s2">dislike how governments have had</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.969" end="01:14:29.409" style="s2">existing governments and monopolies and</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.860" end="01:14:31.900" style="s2">violence have hegemony over this social</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.409" end="01:14:33.340" style="s2">function of coordination and enforcing</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.900" end="01:14:36.940" style="s2">structures of rules and you want there</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.340" end="01:14:38.619" style="s2">to exist an alternative then like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.940" end="01:14:42.849" style="s2">something that we can talk about right</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.619" end="01:14:48.489" style="s2">so I mean if if the dream is to augments</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.849" end="01:14:50.530" style="s2">yes and I mean I&#39;d argue that the block</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.489" end="01:14:53.320" style="s2">chains have a very and if necessary role</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.530" end="01:14:55.239" style="s2">now especially kind of given modern kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.320" end="01:14:58.119" style="s2">of political trends work there basically</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.239" end="01:15:00.520" style="s2">is no single traditional political body</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.119" end="01:15:01.840" style="s2">that&#39;s accepted as trustworthy by the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.520" end="01:15:04.329" style="s2">entire world and it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.840" end="01:15:07.659" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be one but like if your</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.329" end="01:15:10.030" style="s2">dream is to and if completely over</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.659" end="01:15:11.889" style="s2">overturn things and have some simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.030" end="01:15:13.889" style="s2">notion of digital property rights as the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.889" end="01:15:17.619" style="s2">only thing that governs behavior then</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.889" end="01:15:19.869" style="s2">that&#39;s something that like you can try</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.619" end="01:15:21.159" style="s2">for but you&#39;re not going to succeed let</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.869" end="01:15:23.500" style="s2">me try something else with you that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.159" end="01:15:26.170" style="s2">curious about you and I are both plugged</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.500" end="01:15:29.019" style="s2">in to this weird alternate world that</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.170" end="01:15:29.879" style="s2">thinks very differently and I had Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.019" end="01:15:31.499" style="s2">yang</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.879" end="01:15:35.039" style="s2">in that chair and you saw that episode</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.499" end="01:15:37.999" style="s2">of the the point before some people call</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.039" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">this neuro divergence that this is a non</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.999" end="01:15:46.369" style="s2">neurotypical world and i would say that</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:50.579" style="s2">both you and i exhibit some indicia of</p>

<p begin="01:15:50.579" end="01:15:55.590" style="s2">thing that occurred to me is that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.289" end="01:15:59.249" style="s2">brought up slight star codex which is</p>

<p begin="01:16:01.769" end="01:16:06.599" style="s2">and i was thinking about the difference</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.269" end="01:16:55.709" style="s2">like pirate radio which is the phrase I</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.070" end="01:16:58.919" style="s2">keep or some is that because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.709" end="01:17:02.429" style="s2">Russian yes what can we do potentially</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.919" end="01:17:05.519" style="s2">using your technology to even the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.429" end="01:17:08.969" style="s2">playing field between corporate sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.519" end="01:17:10.829" style="s2">making and this kind of home-brewed</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.969" end="01:17:14.909" style="s2">sense making that seems to me to be of</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.829" end="01:17:17.699" style="s2">an infinitely superior level hmm well</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.909" end="01:17:21.059" style="s2">not infinitely but quite superior yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.699" end="01:17:24.749" style="s2">so I think like once again there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.059" end="01:17:27.689" style="s2">of two aspects to kind of blockchain TM</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.749" end="01:17:29.760" style="s2">that I think are a equally valuable here</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.689" end="01:17:31.019" style="s2">one is the technology itself and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.760" end="01:17:34.649" style="s2">the other is the existing community</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.019" end="01:17:36.899" style="s2">around the technology and I mean with</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.649" end="01:17:41.939" style="s2">the ticket with the technology itself I</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.899" end="01:17:43.620" style="s2">mean you can try to like create and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.939" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">know institutions for</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.620" end="01:17:49.830" style="s2">I could do even things like funding like</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:51.630" style="s2">podcasts for example and like even like</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.830" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">things like this kind of get coin grants</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.630" end="01:17:56.100" style="s2">quadratic voting for example it would be</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:58.110" style="s2">a potentially a great way to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.100" end="01:18:02.460" style="s2">funds media organizations that avoids</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.110" end="01:18:03.930" style="s2">the pitfalls of both say a present-day</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.460" end="01:18:06.210" style="s2">media which is funded by some</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.930" end="01:18:08.280" style="s2">combination of a tree of like</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.210" end="01:18:10.410" style="s2">advertising and horrible quick made</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.280" end="01:18:12.990" style="s2">incentives and at the same time avoid</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.410" end="01:18:15.180" style="s2">the pitfalls of like basically sent</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.990" end="01:18:18.450" style="s2">accentually controlled media and create</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.180" end="01:18:20.070" style="s2">a third alternative so and like it</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.450" end="01:18:22.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have to be quadratic voting</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.070" end="01:18:24.600" style="s2">it could be some other kind of mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.770" end="01:18:26.970" style="s2">for funding and ball chains could be</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.600" end="01:18:30.450" style="s2">used as a base layer for that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.970" end="01:18:35.150" style="s2">also the end up watching of community as</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.450" end="01:18:38.400" style="s2">a group of people who care about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.150" end="01:18:39.900" style="s2">many of these kinds of ideas and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.400" end="01:18:42.300" style="s2">even a lot of etherion people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.900" end="01:18:44.850" style="s2">definitely and some weight star codecs</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.300" end="01:18:47.910" style="s2">adjacent you know then I feel like I</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.850" end="01:18:50.460" style="s2">have tried my best to kind of bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.910" end="01:18:52.710" style="s2">these worlds together and get them to</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.460" end="01:18:55.620" style="s2">talk to each other in means sometimes it</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.710" end="01:18:57.450" style="s2">is a challenge because there&#39;s ways in</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.620" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">which they&#39;re similar and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.450" end="01:19:03.270" style="s2">of people who are in both and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:06.180" style="s2">also ways in which they&#39;re sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.270" end="01:19:08.190" style="s2">different but those those differences</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.180" end="01:19:11.130" style="s2">can be a good thing yeah I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.190" end="01:19:15.840" style="s2">concerned that in our we&#39;re coming up on</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.130" end="01:19:18.690" style="s2">an election in the US and I view Fox</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.840" end="01:19:20.810" style="s2">News in the New York Times and CNN is</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.690" end="01:19:24.090" style="s2">like watching professional wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.810" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">it&#39;s got a very clear narrative</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.090" end="01:19:29.250" style="s2">structure before the facts even come in</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.400" end="01:19:30.810" style="s2">yeah this is this is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.250" end="01:19:33.330" style="s2">things I&#39;ve only really started noticing</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.810" end="01:19:38.220" style="s2">maybe in the last like 1 to 2 years</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.330" end="01:19:40.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s narratives are something that</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.220" end="01:19:43.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t seem like you&#39;re there when</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.680" end="01:19:45.900" style="s2">you&#39;re fully inside of them but once you</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.350" end="01:19:48.930" style="s2">and have step outside and you start</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.900" end="01:19:50.190" style="s2">seeing that Nick wait these people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.930" end="01:19:51.990" style="s2">missing something and they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.190" end="01:19:54.840" style="s2">predictions that turn out to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.990" end="01:19:56.909" style="s2">materially incorrect like yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.840" end="01:19:59.250" style="s2">no memory like there&#39;s no cost you</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.909" end="01:20:01.620" style="s2">yeah you want to there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.250" end="01:20:04.440" style="s2">accountability at all and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.620" end="01:20:07.170" style="s2">that you just actively start thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.440" end="01:20:11.750" style="s2">seeking out how to move beyond yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.170" end="01:20:15.960" style="s2">know I think figuring out a better</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.750" end="01:20:18.980" style="s2">funding model for media organizations in</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.960" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">general seems in some ways what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.980" end="01:20:23.760" style="s2">concerned about is that something like</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:26.370" style="s2">podcasting is almost a public good and</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.760" end="01:20:28.650" style="s2">so absolutely a public good</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.370" end="01:20:30.719" style="s2">well I&#39;m advertising in the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.650" end="01:20:34.230" style="s2">that ready to keep I call it the</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.719" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">business model of last resort yes and we</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.230" end="01:20:39.090" style="s2">are going with an ad-supported model</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:41.550" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want a disguise we were</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.090" end="01:20:46.620" style="s2">somebody offered to endow the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.550" end="01:20:48.330" style="s2">not not my employer and I decided</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.620" end="01:20:50.159" style="s2">against it because I think what I really</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.330" end="01:20:52.679" style="s2">want to do is to try to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.159" end="01:20:53.550" style="s2">to improve the business model we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.679" end="01:20:57.960" style="s2">talked about a couple different</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.550" end="01:21:01.199" style="s2">variations on advertising in order to</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.960" end="01:21:04.170" style="s2">make sure that controversial but very</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.199" end="01:21:06.300" style="s2">sensible and level-headed people can</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.170" end="01:21:08.610" style="s2">weather the storm that the big problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.300" end="01:21:11.280" style="s2">that I keep seeing is that advertisers</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.610" end="01:21:15.449" style="s2">pull when there&#39;s a coordinated campaign</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.280" end="01:21:19.590" style="s2">to say drop that program or else yes and</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.449" end="01:21:21.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a a need for something like the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.590" end="01:21:24.870" style="s2">blockchain or smart contract to make</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.960" end="01:21:27.510" style="s2">sure that you can&#39;t silence people who</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.870" end="01:21:29.880" style="s2">are speaking decently just because</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.510" end="01:21:33.570" style="s2">they&#39;ve pissed off a very large activist</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.880" end="01:21:35.400" style="s2">community right so do you see any way in</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.570" end="01:21:38.159" style="s2">which the blockchain for example like I</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.400" end="01:21:40.920" style="s2">might give up advertising if I could</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.159" end="01:21:46.290" style="s2">figure out a way to fund not only this</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.920" end="01:21:49.310" style="s2">program but allied programs so in 2011</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.290" end="01:21:52.170" style="s2">when I was starting Bitcoin magazine I</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.310" end="01:21:54.060" style="s2">well it started off with like with this</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.170" end="01:21:56.760" style="s2">one anonymous person whose name I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.060" end="01:21:59.790" style="s2">never know who aside from Kiba his</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.760" end="01:22:02.040" style="s2">internet handle and who was just paying</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.790" end="01:22:03.960" style="s2">me five Bitcoin which back then was $4</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.040" end="01:22:07.199" style="s2">per article to write articles for him</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.960" end="01:22:08.639" style="s2">and I mean this was five times Oh lower</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.199" end="01:22:09.929" style="s2">than a minimum wage but I loved it</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.639" end="01:22:10.679" style="s2">because it was the higher highest wage</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.929" end="01:22:15.239" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever had</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.679" end="01:22:17.460" style="s2">um and eventually despite paying me five</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.239" end="01:22:20.040" style="s2">times less than minimum wage I&#39;d keep</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.460" end="01:22:22.080" style="s2">our ran out of money and like he&#39;s told</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.040" end="01:22:25.770" style="s2">me hey maybe the coin week we all have</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.080" end="01:22:27.480" style="s2">to shut down and I came up with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.770" end="01:22:29.100" style="s2">business model that actually ended up</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.480" end="01:22:31.650" style="s2">saving it for a few months and basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.100" end="01:22:33.659" style="s2">saving it all the way until I got could</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.650" end="01:22:36.179" style="s2">have poached my pick one magazine and</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.659" end="01:22:38.460" style="s2">the business model is basically I write</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.179" end="01:22:41.730" style="s2">two articles a week and we&#39;ll publish</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.460" end="01:22:43.830" style="s2">the first paragraph of each article kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.730" end="01:22:45.659" style="s2">of publicly and we&#39;ll say the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.830" end="01:22:47.550" style="s2">these articles is kind of hidden for</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.659" end="01:22:50.489" style="s2">ransom and here are some Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.550" end="01:22:53.100" style="s2">addresses and if people can collectively</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.489" end="01:22:54.780" style="s2">come together and pay 2.5 BTC to these</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.100" end="01:22:58.560" style="s2">Bitcoin addresses everyone for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.780" end="01:23:00.420" style="s2">yes yeah and it actually worked well and</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.560" end="01:23:03.199" style="s2">it actually started raking in like much</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.420" end="01:23:06.870" style="s2">more money than Kiba had paid before so</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.199" end="01:23:09.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s not saying look that precise</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.870" end="01:23:11.760" style="s2">totally gonna sleeve it&#39;s a clever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.540" end="01:23:15.690" style="s2">a clever exploit yeah exactly I like to</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.760" end="01:23:18.120" style="s2">me more clever experiments as like what</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.690" end="01:23:20.699" style="s2">smart contracts are all about so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.120" end="01:23:24.540" style="s2">try lots of different things and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.699" end="01:23:26.280" style="s2">gonna have come upon mmm some steps</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.540" end="01:23:27.960" style="s2">forward that are interesting italic I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.280" end="01:23:29.969" style="s2">love to have you come back and talk to</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.960" end="01:23:31.980" style="s2">us about other things at other points</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.969" end="01:23:34.560" style="s2">but let me just close by asking you a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.980" end="01:23:38.010" style="s2">couple of questions about the mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.560" end="01:23:39.989" style="s2">origins of decentralized computing the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.010" end="01:23:44.370" style="s2">blockchain and all of this stuff sure</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.989" end="01:23:48.510" style="s2">what the hell why don&#39;t we know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.370" end="01:23:51.989" style="s2">Satoshi is at this point where Satoshi</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.510" end="01:23:54.780" style="s2">si seemingly came up with the first</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.989" end="01:23:55.890" style="s2">really viable version of this this idea</p>

<p begin="01:24:04.350" end="01:24:11.640" style="s2">think you know and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.040" end="01:24:13.980" style="s2">mysterious origin story yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.640" end="01:24:19.110" style="s2">surprises a lot of people does it</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.980" end="01:24:21.449" style="s2">surprise you it does I mean it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.110" end="01:24:24.329" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely not many people that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.449" end="01:24:26.040" style="s2">I have managed to stay anonymous and if</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.329" end="01:24:29.280" style="s2">the rooh of that level of prominence</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.040" end="01:24:31.409" style="s2">like even axilla roads the kind of first</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.280" end="01:24:33.090" style="s2">big round of crypto anarchistic law</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.409" end="01:24:35.099" style="s2">project on top of Bitcoin and like after</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.090" end="01:24:41.070" style="s2">about two years Russell Birk got caught</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.099" end="01:24:42.989" style="s2">and me and the tools for just continuing</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.070" end="01:24:45.119" style="s2">to look at things that you say until</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.989" end="01:24:48.270" style="s2">eventually you slip up and you use some</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.119" end="01:24:49.949" style="s2">word word patterns that match like word</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.270" end="01:24:52.440" style="s2">patterns that you used under your name</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.949" end="01:24:54.360" style="s2">and then you correlate things like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.440" end="01:24:56.579" style="s2">difficult to get around and like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.360" end="01:24:59.790" style="s2">Unabomber got away with it for a long</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.579" end="01:25:01.590" style="s2">time mmm the yeah you know but the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.790" end="01:25:04.139" style="s2">Citizens Committee to investigate the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.590" end="01:25:09.020" style="s2">FBI that pulled off this amazing heist</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.139" end="01:25:11.760" style="s2">in 1971 so in Ted wrote his stuff in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.020" end="01:25:14.460" style="s2">1970s right and that&#39;s also 1970 no</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.760" end="01:25:16.369" style="s2">saying and now we have we have the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.460" end="01:25:18.960" style="s2">internet and everyone&#39;s stuff is on a</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.369" end="01:25:20.909" style="s2">it&#39;s publicly available we have machine</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.960" end="01:25:22.530" style="s2">learning we have statistical tools do</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.909" end="01:25:24.119" style="s2">you think it&#39;s well known who&#39;s Satoshi</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.530" end="01:25:29.849" style="s2">is within a group that doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.119" end="01:25:31.739" style="s2">talk no so I in I think that I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.849" end="01:25:38.059" style="s2">there&#39;s high uncertainty about this but</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.739" end="01:25:40.619" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s very likely that</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.059" end="01:25:44.099" style="s2">excessive she has one person you think</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.619" end="01:25:47.369" style="s2">he is one person yeah and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.099" end="01:25:51.389" style="s2">some like a very grand conspiracy big</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.369" end="01:25:54.090" style="s2">Lou think you know Satoshi not that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.389" end="01:25:56.329" style="s2">know who&#39;s Satoshi is but do you think I</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.090" end="01:26:01.949" style="s2">think it&#39;s someone I know personal yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.329" end="01:26:05.040" style="s2">so if I had to pick one person and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.949" end="01:26:07.679" style="s2">and I&#39;m not asking you to out that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.040" end="01:26:10.079" style="s2">can say if you know you&#39;ll say it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.679" end="01:26:12.449" style="s2">it&#39;s not an uncommon opinion if I if I</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.079" end="01:26:15.989" style="s2">had to bet my wife on one person health</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.449" end="01:26:17.909" style="s2">any basically because in hell was around</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.989" end="01:26:20.010" style="s2">in the early days he clearly understood</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.909" end="01:26:22.139" style="s2">what was going on here clearly</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.010" end="01:26:24.360" style="s2">participated since the beginning and he</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.139" end="01:26:25.739" style="s2">also died at the exact time basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.360" end="01:26:27.540" style="s2">that&#39;s where she disappeared and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.739" end="01:26:30.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.540" end="01:26:32.699" style="s2">coincidences in his favor but then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.510" end="01:26:34.349" style="s2">the one person I&#39;d bet on if I had to</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.699" end="01:26:36.000" style="s2">bet on someone but I&#39;d also bet against</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.349" end="01:26:37.890" style="s2">him when I gets well under fifty percent</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.000" end="01:26:41.330" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.890" end="01:26:43.560" style="s2">pretty good caper yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.330" end="01:26:46.230" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a significant chance</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.560" end="01:26:47.850" style="s2">that it&#39;s like someone who is still in</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.230" end="01:26:50.610" style="s2">the in the crypto space somewhere that</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.850" end="01:26:53.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve met at some point or it could just</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.610" end="01:26:59.030" style="s2">be someone we have never met and never</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.190" end="01:27:01.800" style="s2">will hmm he&#39;s not a really good job like</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.030" end="01:27:03.720" style="s2">even just kind of setting himself up as</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.800" end="01:27:11.160" style="s2">this kind of perfect world she or they</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.720" end="01:27:15.780" style="s2">yes yes and no yeah she she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.160" end="01:27:19.200" style="s2">like impressed a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.780" end="01:27:21.030" style="s2">pretty yeah I find it very inspiring one</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.200" end="01:27:26.300" style="s2">of the great intellectual feats of our</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.030" end="01:27:28.770" style="s2">time would have anonymous authorship and</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.300" end="01:27:30.720" style="s2">the only story I know that&#39;s comparable</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.770" end="01:27:32.670" style="s2">to that is this bizarre break-in story</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.720" end="01:27:35.310" style="s2">where there was a woman I believe named</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.670" end="01:27:36.840" style="s2">Judy Feingold who was determined to take</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.310" end="01:27:39.200" style="s2">the secret to the grave</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.840" end="01:27:42.450" style="s2">and the other people in the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.200" end="01:27:44.700" style="s2">left the conspiracy after the statute of</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.450" end="01:27:46.890" style="s2">limitations had run out and they started</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.700" end="01:27:48.240" style="s2">talking and then her perspective was we</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.890" end="01:27:51.420" style="s2">all agreed we were never gonna mention</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.240" end="01:27:55.980" style="s2">who did it there&#39;s some desire usually</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.420" end="01:27:58.710" style="s2">to get caught and an urge to purge yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.980" end="01:28:00.480" style="s2">well that does make it more likely</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.710" end="01:28:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s one person right conspiracies</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.480" end="01:28:04.820" style="s2">get exponentially harder the more people</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.160" end="01:28:07.770" style="s2">you add that&#39;s true</p>
