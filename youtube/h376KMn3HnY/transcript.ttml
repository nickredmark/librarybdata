<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">talk about just like our experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">sexuality in general and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">communicate better about them so why&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">you start only fans or why&#39;d you start</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">to go on it um I had in the past done</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:58.470" style="s2">sex work online as a full-time sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">gay briefly I used to be sort of one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.470" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">those girls who is on the sub reddits</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">and would end up bringing boys from from</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:09.079" style="s2">there to patreon and having kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">similar sort of subscription style um</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.079" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">but I found that to do it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">and to do it as your main source of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:20.250" style="s2">income required a sort of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:22.799" style="s2">that was much more transactional than</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.250" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">what I really enjoyed about providing</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.799" end="00:03:29.190" style="s2">adult content it felt less like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">exhibitionism and more like work in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.190" end="00:03:34.380" style="s2">way that wasn&#39;t fun and another thing I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">found was that venturing out so far into</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.380" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">the open water of the Internet and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:43.769" style="s2">providing free adult content tended to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:45.660" style="s2">attract some bad apples that would would</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.769" end="00:03:49.139" style="s2">you know interact with me in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:52.079" style="s2">were scary and it became not worth it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.139" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">like pursue it as a full-time thing but</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.079" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">when only fans became popular again they</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">sort of provided a place where I could</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.790" end="00:04:03.419" style="s2">set a permeable boundary around which</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">kind of men were interacting with my</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.419" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">contents it doesn&#39;t interest me anymore</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">to really use that as my main source of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">income at all but just having like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:18.389" style="s2">price of a latte every month uh to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">my adult content seems to have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.389" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">magical effect of weeding out those bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">actors who would ruin it for all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.680" end="00:04:25.889" style="s2">nice guys who just enjoyed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:28.050" style="s2">of like supportive attention when</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.889" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">they&#39;re expressing sexual attraction and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.050" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s been really nice it&#39;s been a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">nice place for me to do what I naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.260" style="s2">enjoy doing being an exhibitionist</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">little like model girl whatever you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.260" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">like to call it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:44.740" style="s2">and men like it too it&#39;s nice to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">there for them it&#39;s nice to be a woman</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.740" end="00:04:51.960" style="s2">who is like responsive and receptive to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:54.580" style="s2">expressions of attraction from men in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.960" end="00:04:56.350" style="s2">mimetic environment that&#39;s often really</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.580" end="00:05:00.690" style="s2">hostile to men regardless of their</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.350" end="00:05:04.330" style="s2">sexualities yeah we talked on Monday</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:06.610" style="s2">when I mentioned you had a journal my</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.330" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">journals that I do daily I started</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.610" end="00:05:10.210" style="s2">put you in a category which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:11.560" style="s2">belong into like this meta modern woman</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.210" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">trying to make a buck and then the you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.560" end="00:05:15.250" style="s2">know the many princes and you seen you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:17.530" style="s2">push back and said no I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.250" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">because I actually love it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.530" end="00:05:23.560" style="s2">surprised but not surprised in a way so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:25.960" style="s2">I&#39;m curiously if you can like unpack</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.560" end="00:05:28.210" style="s2">that desire what do you get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.960" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">and what do you think you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.210" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">only fans get out of it um I think for</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.990" end="00:05:38.410" style="s2">me there&#39;s a big way in which I am</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:41.470" style="s2">reclaiming my my sense of sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.410" end="00:05:45.340" style="s2">through art I was in relationships as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.470" end="00:05:47.380" style="s2">young girl that were rougher and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.340" end="00:05:49.479" style="s2">sexuality didn&#39;t initially feel like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.380" end="00:05:52.419" style="s2">belongs to me I felt like something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.479" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">I liked had to kind of like negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.419" end="00:05:56.409" style="s2">how much I was going to have to give</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:59.800" style="s2">away just because of the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.409" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">world so to be able to come to a place</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:04.900" style="s2">where that&#39;s not the way that I relate</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">with men anymore and instead I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.900" end="00:06:10.150" style="s2">my sexuality is very much in my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">frame on my own terms and an expression</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.150" end="00:06:16.930" style="s2">of like joy and togetherness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.870" end="00:06:19.240" style="s2">nice to feel like you can present</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.930" end="00:06:21.460" style="s2">yourself and your sexuality in an</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.240" end="00:06:24.280" style="s2">aesthetic way and not feel objectified</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.460" end="00:06:27.159" style="s2">you you can do it in a way that for you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.280" end="00:06:28.690" style="s2">is very human and I think it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.159" end="00:06:29.949" style="s2">difference I think when you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.690" end="00:06:31.750" style="s2">doing it from a place that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.949" end="00:06:34.120" style="s2">transactional and you&#39;re doing it from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.750" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">place of like expressing a part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.120" end="00:06:37.449" style="s2">yourself that is deeply human and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.430" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.449" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">I think people resonate with it in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.430" end="00:06:42.789" style="s2">different way and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:44.590" style="s2">relationships that I have with my fans</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.789" end="00:06:47.289" style="s2">or clients or whatever you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.590" end="00:06:50.010" style="s2">call them end up being much more like</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.289" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">friendships and much less like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.010" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">transactions</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:56.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting because you use</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:58.060" style="s2">the term often the pair of social</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">relationships and I thought I&#39;m the only</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:06.370" style="s2">that kind of comes about because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:09.460" style="s2">seems almost counter to what you just</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.370" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">said about actually being friends it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.289" end="00:07:51.610" style="s2">because at that point I don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.750" end="00:07:54.550" style="s2">know you on the other side of the camera</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.610" end="00:07:57.370" style="s2">or whatever at all it&#39;s not social for</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.669" end="00:08:11.650" style="s2">world at that first interaction level so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:14.469" style="s2">at that at that point the parasocial</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.650" end="00:08:16.990" style="s2">relationship is all that&#39;s available but</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.469" end="00:08:19.539" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not offering</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.990" end="00:08:21.389" style="s2">anything valuable I think that even just</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.539" end="00:08:24.550" style="s2">by being a presence that&#39;s out there</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.570" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">desirable more than actually do the work</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.850" end="00:08:54.279" style="s2">kind of mentality that I think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:56.110" style="s2">stuck in the nice thing about being able</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.110" end="00:09:01.329" style="s2">broadcast level at that parasocial level</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.510" end="00:09:04.390" style="s2">is that it is so so tempting to people</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.329" end="00:09:05.000" style="s2">we are so so hungry for something a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.390" end="00:09:08.570" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.000" end="00:09:11.240" style="s2">I see er then just porn hub and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.570" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">for a lot of people including men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.240" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">to decontextualized to just be watching</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:19.100" style="s2">videos of girls doing erotic things</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:22.100" style="s2">there&#39;s just not enough there to really</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.930" end="00:09:35.090" style="s2">this need in the market for for women</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.150" end="00:09:36.950" style="s2">and for men to have a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.090" end="00:09:40.460" style="s2">connection even if it&#39;s still in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.950" end="00:09:44.180" style="s2">like flirty sexual kind of realm and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.460" end="00:09:45.560" style="s2">as people are drawn in some people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.180" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">drawn in really really close</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.880" end="00:09:54.530" style="s2">and what starts out as parasocial</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.880" end="00:09:57.620" style="s2">absolutely progresses into a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.530" end="00:10:00.680" style="s2">like full social friendship and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.620" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s not something that I offer on</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:30.680" style="s2">collaborative shared life experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:32.330" style="s2">yeah I love that about that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.680" end="00:10:34.190" style="s2">coming to mind is sort of like my active</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.330" end="00:10:35.900" style="s2">daily journal writings and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.190" end="00:10:37.160" style="s2">pair of social quality to because people</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.900" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">are reading them like I think talkies</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.160" end="00:10:39.650" style="s2">you talking about knees you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">about me and there&#39;s like an uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.650" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">intimacy going on there but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:44.630" style="s2">associated with the stoah space so there</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">is like a real intimacy that&#39;s forming</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.630" end="00:10:49.010" style="s2">as well so it&#39;s almost like Trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:50.450" style="s2">a seductive Trojan horse to get people</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.010" end="00:10:52.400" style="s2">to the store and so we can become a body</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">together and it seems like you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.400" end="00:10:56.180" style="s2">something similar with with that with</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.010" style="s2">that parasocial relationship is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.180" end="00:10:59.570" style="s2">like a way to get them into the only</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.010" end="00:11:01.850" style="s2">fans and then that&#39;s a screening</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.570" end="00:11:03.560" style="s2">mechanism and then via the discernment</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.850" end="00:11:05.270" style="s2">or the essence or the de menthe or</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.560" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">whatever you want to call it then a real</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.270" end="00:11:11.900" style="s2">relationship could form from that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:14.030" style="s2">absolutely and you have any sense how it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.900" end="00:11:16.130" style="s2">could go a step deeper into like more of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.030" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">a community oz like an actual community</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:21.860" style="s2">building from that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:24.230" style="s2">yeah absolutely I think that um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.860" end="00:11:27.770" style="s2">this way that sexuality is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.230" end="00:11:31.580" style="s2">things that faces the most like social</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.770" end="00:11:38.150" style="s2">stigma and personal shame uh and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.580" end="00:11:40.670" style="s2">you set up the game as a sexual game you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.150" end="00:11:42.980" style="s2">set up the game as a game we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.670" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">transgressive and subversive and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.980" end="00:11:49.340" style="s2">vulnerable and raw and carnal is like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">automatically up for grabs and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.340" end="00:11:55.640" style="s2">amazing to me how when you allow people</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.250" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">into a safe sexual space so many other</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.640" end="00:11:59.810" style="s2">things feel safe that don&#39;t usually feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">safe to when you&#39;re allowed to tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.810" end="00:12:02.930" style="s2">people your sexual fantasies you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:04.970" style="s2">allowed to tell people your real</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.930" end="00:12:06.680" style="s2">fantasies about your life you&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.970" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">to tell people what you really want out</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.680" end="00:12:09.800" style="s2">of your relationship with the world not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:12.830" style="s2">just your relationships with people of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.800" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2">the sex that you&#39;re attracted to you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.830" end="00:12:18.290" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s what&#39;s really like</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.400" end="00:12:20.540" style="s2">going to have a ripple effect it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.290" end="00:12:23.210" style="s2">necessarily that I might cause like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.540" end="00:12:26.930" style="s2">wide chain of orgasms although that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.210" end="00:12:29.450" style="s2">definitely true the it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.930" end="00:12:35.000" style="s2">creative spark that&#39;s really going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.450" end="00:12:37.190" style="s2">spread and catch fire can you speak a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.000" end="00:12:40.150" style="s2">little bit on cope it and how it relates</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.190" end="00:12:43.300" style="s2">to all this and the rise of only fans</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.150" end="00:12:46.460" style="s2">yeah absolutely I think right now we</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.300" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">especially don&#39;t have the normal options</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.460" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">that we have for in real life social</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:53.840" style="s2">contact and it&#39;s recreating a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.610" style="s2">very strange dynamics that we probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.840" end="00:12:58.550" style="s2">have an experience since we were</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.610" end="00:13:01.220" style="s2">dependent on other people like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.550" end="00:13:03.260" style="s2">this way that dating right now for</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:05.690" style="s2">everyone regardless of your age is like</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.260" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">risky and stigmatized and subversive</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.690" end="00:13:10.960" style="s2">like it was when you were a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">sneaking around at high school and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.960" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">that is something that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">able to talk about and and be honest</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:18.710" style="s2">with ourselves about and honest with</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:20.750" style="s2">ourselves about however we&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.710" end="00:13:23.390" style="s2">that if we want to make you know</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.390" end="00:13:28.610" style="s2">to our communities and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.150" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">responsible to our own like humanity</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.610" end="00:13:31.589" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard for us to all be this</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.589" end="00:13:36.899" style="s2">and it&#39;s really hard for us to go into</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:40.019" style="s2">that kind of isolation with a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.899" end="00:13:41.999" style="s2">pre-existing stigma around longing for a</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.060" end="00:13:50.220" style="s2">so I think that there I see often lots</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.449" end="00:13:52.379" style="s2">of memes that have like a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.220" end="00:13:54.629" style="s2">judgment around people who provide</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.379" end="00:13:58.019" style="s2">content on only fans or pay for content</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.629" end="00:14:03.269" style="s2">on only fans and I think that it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.019" end="00:14:05.550" style="s2">bad that the only way that we seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.269" end="00:14:08.309" style="s2">able to express ourselves about it is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.550" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">have this sort of nervous laughter it</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.309" end="00:14:11.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem genuine to me that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:13.410" style="s2">really think it&#39;s so funny when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.790" end="00:14:15.749" style="s2">spreading memes like this it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">displays to me a sexual insecurity of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.749" end="00:14:21.509" style="s2">like oh look at those people having</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">sexual feelings I&#39;m not like them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.509" end="00:14:26.339" style="s2">and I think it says more about us</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:28.499" style="s2">feeling uncomfortable in general with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.339" end="00:14:31.230" style="s2">the conversation and having to like cope</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.499" end="00:14:33.480" style="s2">with that through humor and judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.230" end="00:14:38.069" style="s2">I&#39;d really like to see that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.480" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">all deconstructed love it</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.069" end="00:14:42.689" style="s2">so I have a few questions more questions</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.600" end="00:15:22.860" style="s2">raw sexuality so how do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.029" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">could steal and seduce the culture with</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.860" end="00:15:30.870" style="s2">this I I really love the the steal and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:33.509" style="s2">seduce the culture like tagline I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.870" end="00:15:37.620" style="s2">that it already actually has like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.509" end="00:15:40.019" style="s2">kind of secret nod to the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.620" end="00:15:41.840" style="s2">defusing tensions between genders in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.019" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">this culture war that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.840" end="00:15:48.350" style="s2">I think stealing is so mercurial it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">mercury it&#39;s so Hermes it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.350" end="00:15:52.820" style="s2">masculine sort of like trickster energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:55.790" style="s2">and it gets me so excited I love it so</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.820" end="00:15:58.550" style="s2">much and then seducing is very Benison</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.790" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">it&#39;s very Aphrodite and and to have this</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.550" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">kind of like androgynous merging of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">these two like different subversive sexy</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">ways to look at like influencing our</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:11.090" style="s2">culture already like says so much about</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:13.760" style="s2">the way that we can like have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.090" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">fun working together across this gender</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.760" end="00:16:22.550" style="s2">divide I think that one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">we can like start out really easy is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.550" end="00:16:29.570" style="s2">just by having integrity I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:31.190" style="s2">faith I think that if we decide that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.570" end="00:16:32.570" style="s2">gonna start ending the culture work</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.190" end="00:16:34.490" style="s2">personally because that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.570" end="00:16:36.530" style="s2">responsibility and that means that I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.490" end="00:16:38.900" style="s2">going to treat people with sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.530" end="00:16:40.400" style="s2">regardless of their gender I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.900" end="00:16:41.750" style="s2">that&#39;s like a beautiful position to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.400" end="00:16:43.880" style="s2">start and I think that that will ripple</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.750" end="00:16:45.140" style="s2">out and diffuse a lot of conflicts that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.880" end="00:16:46.970" style="s2">are going on around you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.140" end="00:16:48.920" style="s2">just by having that position even</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.970" end="00:16:51.350" style="s2">peripheral to people who are having more</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.920" end="00:16:53.480" style="s2">conflicts and I think the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.350" end="00:16:55.550" style="s2">sort of like a reciprocal notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.480" end="00:16:57.470" style="s2">trust people to take that integrity Don</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.550" end="00:16:59.420" style="s2">I know that it&#39;s difficult I know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.470" end="00:17:01.640" style="s2">we&#39;re all getting conditioned to be very</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.420" end="00:17:05.140" style="s2">adversarial especially around gender</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.640" end="00:17:08.030" style="s2">issues especially around sex issues but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.140" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">we see that in this community we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.770" end="00:22:16.560" style="s2">always find a way to share those things</p>

<p begin="00:22:16.560" end="00:22:22.230" style="s2">Camille you had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.230" end="00:22:22.230" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.659" end="00:22:30.129" style="s2">Hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.740" end="00:22:34.419" style="s2">what life practices create raw sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.129" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">and what are some of yours um I love</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.419" end="00:22:39.580" style="s2">this question I think it&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:41.320" style="s2">question my Bible when it comes to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.580" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">question is a book called mating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.320" end="00:22:47.379" style="s2">captivity by Esther Perel it is written</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:49.330" style="s2">for people in monogamous relationships</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.379" end="00:22:51.549" style="s2">but I think that it absolutely applies</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.330" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">to both monogamous and non-monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.549" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">relationships and it&#39;s very useful to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:58.299" style="s2">read even if you&#39;re not dating anybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:23:03.369" style="s2">at the moment it talks about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.299" end="00:23:06.100" style="s2">that the more security and intimacy you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.369" end="00:23:07.960" style="s2">seek in a relationship the more freedom</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.100" end="00:23:10.029" style="s2">and eroticism you&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.960" end="00:23:13.809" style="s2">forfeit in order to maintain that level</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.029" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">of closeness an analogy I like to use to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.809" end="00:23:19.659" style="s2">explain it is that lust really is like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:23.169" style="s2">fire if you smother it it goes out it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.659" end="00:23:26.889" style="s2">you need oxygen for that fire to burn so</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.169" end="00:23:29.909" style="s2">life practices that work for me to keep</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.889" end="00:23:32.830" style="s2">you know sexual sparks nice and a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.909" end="00:23:34.269" style="s2">frequent and spicy in my relationships</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.830" end="00:23:36.070" style="s2">whether they&#39;re monogamous or</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.269" end="00:23:40.809" style="s2">non-monogamous at any given time is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.070" end="00:23:42.669" style="s2">stuff like having your own projects just</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.809" end="00:23:44.289" style="s2">having stuff that&#39;s going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.669" end="00:23:46.659" style="s2">life that does not have to do with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.289" end="00:23:48.909" style="s2">partner is a huge way to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.659" end="00:23:51.519" style="s2">there&#39;s always this like independence</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.909" end="00:23:53.740" style="s2">and mystery that you two have for</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.519" end="00:23:56.350" style="s2">yourselves and have as like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.740" end="00:23:58.659" style="s2">to like flirt around with and like tease</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.350" end="00:24:00.999" style="s2">around in front of each other it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.659" end="00:24:03.129" style="s2">exciting to my boyfriend that I am on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.999" end="00:24:05.169" style="s2">Zune call right now doing my own thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.129" end="00:24:06.460" style="s2">and being you know a big independent</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.169" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">personality I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.460" end="00:24:09.369" style="s2">something that he finds really</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">attractive and the fact that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.369" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">probably over in another room making his</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.070" style="s2">own music is like very attractive to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">the fact that we can give each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.070" end="00:24:18.850" style="s2">that space to have our own interests is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:20.590" style="s2">super super important um</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.850" end="00:24:24.639" style="s2">I think the other big thing other than</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.590" end="00:24:28.779" style="s2">having your own life is sharing it like</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.639" end="00:24:32.500" style="s2">fully be totally honest uh there is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.779" end="00:24:35.379" style="s2">so many there&#39;s so many regrets and like</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.500" end="00:24:37.059" style="s2">bad arguments that I&#39;ve had in in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.379" end="00:24:39.639" style="s2">relationships because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.059" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">had a five-second opportunity to fess up</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.639" end="00:24:43.629" style="s2">to something and I got insecure and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:46.539" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite take the opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.629" end="00:24:49.299" style="s2">then everything snowballs there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.539" end="00:24:52.389" style="s2">like moments of integrity that come to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.299" end="00:24:54.549" style="s2">you and they feel karmically loaded and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.389" end="00:24:56.769" style="s2">you have to be ready to like stop and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.549" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">really practice your stoicism in those</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.769" end="00:25:02.649" style="s2">moments and be willing to like fully</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.749" style="s2">share exactly what&#39;s going on for you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.649" end="00:25:06.190" style="s2">even if you&#39;ve conditions been</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.190" end="00:25:12.909" style="s2">acceptable it&#39;s the it&#39;s the face leap</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.759" end="00:25:15.009" style="s2">that you make on a daily basis to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.909" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">know that your partner loves you beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.009" end="00:25:24.009" style="s2">the the limitations that society</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">suggests for them cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.009" end="00:25:32.440" style="s2">rheya you had a question I do thanks</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:39.159" style="s2">Peter and thanks maybe for being here um</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.440" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">Shin was or is how erotic art and being</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.159" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2">on camera in this manner allowed you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.070" style="s2">connect allowed you to connect more</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:47.019" style="s2">deeply with yourself and do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.070" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">that this practice whether it is sharing</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.019" end="00:25:51.580" style="s2">or just for personal use is valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:54.009" style="s2">more people to experience when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.580" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">to connecting to sacred sexuality within</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">with experimenting with creating art</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.009" end="00:26:20.230" style="s2">though there&#39;s a lot of barriers to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.309" end="00:26:22.509" style="s2">celebrating the way that you feel about</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.999" end="00:26:30.070" style="s2">about how oppressed we feel by beauty</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.210" end="00:26:32.470" style="s2">ideals and how difficult it is for us</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.070" end="00:26:33.759" style="s2">and and I think that that&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.470" end="00:26:36.009" style="s2">think that those are feelings that need</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.180" end="00:27:07.730" style="s2">say something like I think my body looks</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.910" end="00:27:09.800" style="s2">really good in this piece of art we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.730" end="00:27:11.780" style="s2">inviting people to have those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.800" end="00:27:13.880" style="s2">thoughts about themselves - and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.780" end="00:27:17.180" style="s2">that that is part of seducing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.880" end="00:27:20.270" style="s2">culture and and like bringing people a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.180" end="00:27:22.340" style="s2">reason to feel on a felt sense that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.270" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">should be body positive and sex positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.340" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">rather than doing a sermon or preaching</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">to them that they have the wrong idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:35.000" style="s2">about their bodies I think I hear from</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:38.120" style="s2">you too that there&#39;s like something</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">about divinity I think I was at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.120" end="00:27:42.350" style="s2">gender and transition and discourse talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">yesterday and something that came up was</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.350" end="00:27:47.510" style="s2">this idea that we&#39;ve talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.850" style="s2">recently in culture about masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.510" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">and femininity as scientific concepts</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.850" end="00:27:53.990" style="s2">but they have been spiritual concepts</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.860" end="00:27:57.830" style="s2">just as long as we&#39;ve connected them to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.990" end="00:28:01.370" style="s2">biology I think that um there&#39;s this way</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:03.080" style="s2">that different cultures across time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.370" end="00:28:05.300" style="s2">different religions have presented</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.080" end="00:28:07.220" style="s2">masculinity and femininity in these like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.300" end="00:28:09.680" style="s2">patterned ways and there&#39;s ways that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:11.660" style="s2">sometimes they reverse themselves but</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.680" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">they always kind of present a polarity</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.660" end="00:28:16.390" style="s2">and that polarity I think says something</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:19.460" style="s2">about what it&#39;s like to be a human being</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.390" end="00:28:22.730" style="s2">regardless of which gender identity you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.460" end="00:28:24.620" style="s2">present more forwardly with and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.730" end="00:28:27.530" style="s2">that when you step into a space where</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.620" end="00:28:29.420" style="s2">you&#39;re making art around your body in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.530" end="00:28:33.050" style="s2">way that&#39;s likely going to be received</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.420" end="00:28:34.610" style="s2">as gendered there&#39;s a opportunity to rub</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.050" end="00:28:37.130" style="s2">up against all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.610" end="00:28:39.650" style="s2">interconnections between mimetic spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.130" end="00:28:43.940" style="s2">that focus on science and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.650" end="00:28:45.740" style="s2">and relationships and money I think all</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.940" end="00:28:47.570" style="s2">of those are really interesting spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.740" end="00:28:50.330" style="s2">that sex interconnects with and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.570" end="00:28:52.430" style="s2">that it&#39;s good for us to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.330" end="00:28:55.870" style="s2">spaces that allow us to look at it from</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.430" end="00:28:55.870" style="s2">multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:06.289" style="s2">Theisen yet a question or statement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.289" end="00:29:07.850" style="s2">thanks Peter thank you maybe I found</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.289" end="00:29:10.100" style="s2">myself a little nervous to bring this up</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.850" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">and so I&#39;ll express a perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:14.779" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely not attached to but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:17.720" style="s2">definitely comes up for me and that is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.779" end="00:29:21.159" style="s2">can imagine myself being single and not</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.720" end="00:29:25.070" style="s2">in a relationship and in that case</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.159" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">longing for connection and sexual</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.070" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">connection especially and going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">things like only fans subscribing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:33.830" style="s2">content and then starting to get that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">crush feeling in connection through</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.830" end="00:29:39.080" style="s2">there and when I imagine myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.049" end="00:29:40.070" style="s2">scenario it concerns me that that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.080" end="00:29:42.529" style="s2">would happen and that this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.070" end="00:29:45.110" style="s2">with other men that would enable like</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.529" end="00:29:47.570" style="s2">some of my poorest behaviors like not</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.110" end="00:29:49.640" style="s2">working on my physicality and my body</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.570" end="00:29:55.460" style="s2">and my vocation and other things because</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.640" end="00:29:56.600" style="s2">I can just escape here and some and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.460" end="00:30:00.169" style="s2">it makes so the minute makes me</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.600" end="00:30:02.419" style="s2">skeptical that a lot of women would want</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.169" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">to be with a man that has subscribed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.419" end="00:30:07.940" style="s2">content say on only fans because of some</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:10.990" style="s2">of the behavior that might enable so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.940" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">curious what you think about that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.990" end="00:30:15.340" style="s2">think businesses are really important</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.200" style="s2">like intuition that you&#39;re teasing out</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.340" end="00:30:21.110" style="s2">and I think that it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.200" end="00:30:23.299" style="s2">something that like impacts us</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.110" end="00:30:25.309" style="s2">throughout our sexual lives whether we</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.299" end="00:30:29.750" style="s2">are more feminine or masculine</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.309" end="00:30:34.070" style="s2">presenting I think that we often talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.750" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">about sexual practices and not sexual</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.070" end="00:30:39.620" style="s2">ways of being and and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.240" style="s2">end up having these like dichotomous</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.620" end="00:30:44.809" style="s2">relationships with things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.240" end="00:30:47.299" style="s2">masturbating or using porn there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.809" end="00:30:49.970" style="s2">way that it can go really really well or</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.299" end="00:30:51.620" style="s2">really really poorly and that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:53.390" style="s2">confused about which sort of practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.620" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">we should choose because we&#39;re not aware</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.390" end="00:30:58.549" style="s2">that the problem is actually like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:01.580" style="s2">where your hearts that thing not of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.549" end="00:31:04.730" style="s2">you&#39;re doing things so there&#39;s this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.580" end="00:31:07.549" style="s2">that I think that it it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.730" end="00:31:09.429" style="s2">little bit like recreational drug use or</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.549" end="00:31:11.809" style="s2">alcohol drinking I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.429" end="00:31:12.490" style="s2">absolutely dangerous to using</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.809" end="00:31:15.580" style="s2">pornographic</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.490" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">aids in your sex life and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.580" end="00:31:20.290" style="s2">that you should have like an open honest</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:22.510" style="s2">relationship with yourself about and if</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.290" end="00:31:24.490" style="s2">you have some sort of way in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.510" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">you&#39;re relating to pornographic material</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.490" end="00:31:32.200" style="s2">that isn&#39;t healthy for you that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:35.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a normal totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.200" end="00:31:37.650" style="s2">not unique place to start at in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.110" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">sexual journey there&#39;s no reason to like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.650" end="00:31:41.890" style="s2">demonize yourself or think you did a bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">thing or you made a big mistake or</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.890" end="00:31:45.790" style="s2">anything like that you just want to like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.590" style="s2">look at your sex life and think what</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.790" end="00:31:50.410" style="s2">would get me off even more than this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.590" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">would I get off even harder on having</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.410" end="00:31:54.670" style="s2">better relationships and like treating</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:57.250" style="s2">myself better would that be even sexier</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.670" end="00:31:59.020" style="s2">because I think for most of us it would</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.250" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">I think for most of us we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.020" end="00:32:03.309" style="s2">room to treat ourselves in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:06.850" style="s2">make us feel sexier about all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.309" end="00:32:09.790" style="s2">areas of our life um I do want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.850" end="00:32:11.710" style="s2">also though to the idea that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.790" end="00:32:14.110" style="s2">something that I do think about like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.710" end="00:32:15.670" style="s2">am making adult content and I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.110" end="00:32:17.710" style="s2">it out there in a place where men are</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.670" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">vulnerable and men don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.710" end="00:32:21.640" style="s2">have the resources to be using my</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:24.640" style="s2">content in a way that&#39;s healthy for them</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.640" end="00:32:26.350" style="s2">and that does concern me I really care</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:27.880" style="s2">about that and my heart really goes out</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.350" end="00:32:30.429" style="s2">to men who are having these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.880" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">struggles and and then finding that I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.429" end="00:32:35.170" style="s2">like a crutch something that keeps them</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">coping and not thriving that that breaks</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.170" end="00:32:39.610" style="s2">my heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:41.830" style="s2">um the the the thing that keeps me there</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.610" end="00:32:42.809" style="s2">that keeps me taking that risk of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.830" end="00:32:46.630" style="s2">an abler</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.809" end="00:32:49.300" style="s2">being an enabler is that I also know</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.630" end="00:32:51.730" style="s2">that the very most vulnerable men who</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.300" end="00:32:54.700" style="s2">very most need my help are probably not</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.730" end="00:32:57.490" style="s2">getting really any interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.700" end="00:32:59.620" style="s2">women except in these contexts and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.490" end="00:33:01.750" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to go to the darkest places</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.620" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">to find the people who need the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">lights brought into their life I I pray</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">I pray that that that I don&#39;t hurt more</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:14.530" style="s2">than I help um but I&#39;m absolutely aware</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:16.840" style="s2">that I have like a higher ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.530" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">surround it I&#39;m just doing my best and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.840" end="00:33:21.580" style="s2">have my heart in the right place and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:23.380" style="s2">for that that&#39;s my way of being issue I</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.580" end="00:33:25.230" style="s2">have my heart in the right place I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.380" end="00:33:27.630" style="s2">chosen a practice that I hope is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.230" end="00:33:29.940" style="s2">in alignment but I will always be open</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.630" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">to feedback and I will always be open to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.940" end="00:33:34.650" style="s2">realigning so that I&#39;m doing like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">most good in the world that I can do mmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.650" end="00:33:38.850" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s beautiful and I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:39.929" style="s2">felt that and I have the follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.850" end="00:33:42.299" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.929" end="00:33:43.799" style="s2">it&#39;s about masturbation and the Moffat</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.299" end="00:33:46.530" style="s2">movement and I mentioned this in my</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.799" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">journal that my stance is that most men</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.530" end="00:33:50.580" style="s2">should stop masturbating and on and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.870" end="00:33:52.830" style="s2">ontological domains aside aside where</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.580" end="00:33:54.330" style="s2">did it and then you and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.830" end="00:33:56.190" style="s2">last time like I haven&#39;t masturbated</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.330" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">like I couldn&#39;t like five plus years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:34:00.299" style="s2">it feels great I have no desire</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.799" style="s2">to do it whatsoever there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.299" end="00:34:03.660" style="s2">benefits that come from that and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.799" end="00:34:05.790" style="s2">the whole no-fat movement supports that</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.660" end="00:34:06.929" style="s2">as well and then you were pretty recent</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.790" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">like guys I thought oh you would push</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.929" end="00:34:11.700" style="s2">back to it but you don&#39;t have that sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.460" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">of shame projected shame on it and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.700" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">were talking about how yes each person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:16.770" style="s2">spiritual practice might be radically</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.540" style="s2">different given their kind of trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.770" end="00:34:22.649" style="s2">their past trauma all that type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.540" end="00:34:24.570" style="s2">and it seems like you have a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.649" end="00:34:26.850" style="s2">about people getting stuck into like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.570" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">more pathological forms of self pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.850" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">so what do you think about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:35.490" style="s2">know fast movement in general I guess</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:38.550" style="s2">okay I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna do a compliment</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.490" end="00:34:41.179" style="s2">sandwich I like to give feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.550" end="00:34:45.030" style="s2">might be a little bit more constructive</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.179" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">like bracketed with a lot of positive</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.030" end="00:34:50.129" style="s2">energy so the first thing I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:52.830" style="s2">is that people who are considering nofap</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.129" end="00:34:54.929" style="s2">are looking at their sex lives and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.830" end="00:34:57.630" style="s2">seeing that they can make changes that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.929" end="00:34:59.190" style="s2">make it a way that that would be more</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.630" end="00:35:01.500" style="s2">exciting and make their life better and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.190" end="00:35:04.980" style="s2">I&#39;m so excited I&#39;m just so excited that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.500" end="00:35:07.170" style="s2">people would have ideas about how to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.980" end="00:35:09.119" style="s2">different things with their sexual</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.170" end="00:35:11.730" style="s2">relationships with themselves just that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.119" end="00:35:18.840" style="s2">alone is fantastic I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.730" end="00:35:20.970" style="s2">especially the idea that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.840" end="00:35:22.500" style="s2">want something and see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.970" end="00:35:25.050" style="s2">possible and those are the only two</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.500" end="00:35:27.750" style="s2">ingredients to making a different life</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.050" end="00:35:29.940" style="s2">for yourself it is like something that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.750" end="00:35:31.320" style="s2">think is available to people from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.940" end="00:35:32.940" style="s2">nofa a movement that might not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.320" end="00:35:34.530" style="s2">available to them otherwise and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:36.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like foundational I think if if</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.530" end="00:35:38.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the first place that you go and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.630" end="00:35:41.340" style="s2">you find out that you can change who you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.610" end="00:35:43.290" style="s2">are all by yourself that will that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.340" end="00:35:45.360" style="s2">ripple throughout your whole life it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.290" end="00:35:48.750" style="s2">be more than just a sexual opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.360" end="00:35:52.130" style="s2">for you um that being said I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.750" end="00:35:54.390" style="s2">sometimes like so many exciting like</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.130" end="00:35:58.050" style="s2">intellectual and spiritual insights that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.390" end="00:36:00.090" style="s2">we get we can like have them experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.050" end="00:36:02.250" style="s2">this big moment of clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.090" end="00:36:06.570" style="s2">spaciousness and then immediately start</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.250" end="00:36:08.520" style="s2">striving so hard and and that takes us</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.570" end="00:36:10.740" style="s2">into a different way of being we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.520" end="00:36:13.260" style="s2">open and spacious and excited about a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.740" end="00:36:15.240" style="s2">spiritual insight anymore we&#39;re striving</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.260" end="00:36:17.540" style="s2">and trying to be good enough and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.240" end="00:36:20.610" style="s2">tracking and monitoring and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.540" end="00:36:22.200" style="s2">collecting statistics and and it starts</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.610" end="00:36:24.270" style="s2">to be a little bit more on the left</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">brain side and a little bit less on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.270" end="00:36:28.680" style="s2">right brain reconnected to my body</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:31.350" style="s2">change my relationship with myself have</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.680" end="00:36:34.710" style="s2">a more sexually positive experience of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.350" end="00:36:37.260" style="s2">my world kind of way of being so when</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.710" end="00:36:41.250" style="s2">you can like keep an eye out for that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.260" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">pitfall you can totally experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.250" end="00:36:47.370" style="s2">this idea of like oh maybe sexual energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:50.310" style="s2">can be used in other ways that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.370" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">actually find more fulfilling and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.310" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">really excites me I&#39;m gonna make some</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.380" end="00:36:56.460" style="s2">small bets and see how big they payoff</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:58.230" style="s2">around that that I think is super</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.460" end="00:37:00.150" style="s2">exciting I think it&#39;s just important to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.230" end="00:37:01.800" style="s2">make sure that when you pick up</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.150" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">something like no fact it doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.800" end="00:37:05.490" style="s2">another stick to beat yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:06.900" style="s2">around your sexuality it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.490" end="00:37:09.000" style="s2">something that you should see us like</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.900" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">this opportunity to fail and feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.000" end="00:37:12.030" style="s2">about yourself you should see it as an</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:13.890" style="s2">opportunity to fail and learn about</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.030" end="00:37:19.650" style="s2">yourself and try again and try new</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.890" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">things that&#39;s awesome very cool and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.650" end="00:37:22.470" style="s2">maybe and I were talking about her</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.730" end="00:37:24.180" style="s2">having a series here at the stove maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.470" end="00:37:25.620" style="s2">call it raw sexy or sexuality with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.180" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">gray or something and you just like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.620" end="00:37:29.880" style="s2">question like you bring people in to</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:31.260" style="s2">talk to you and I would love for you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.880" end="00:37:33.120" style="s2">interact with someone the no5 community</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.260" end="00:37:34.590" style="s2">and have this discussion because I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.120" end="00:37:40.050" style="s2">you need to be placed to have in such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.590" end="00:37:43.700" style="s2">good-faith way so uh Travis would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.050" end="00:37:47.160" style="s2">like to ask your question yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.700" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">so I just noticed that what comes up</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.160" end="00:37:51.569" style="s2">with me is like a knee-jerk reaction</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:57.619" style="s2">that things like only fans or</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.569" end="00:38:01.019" style="s2">any sort of like I guess pornography is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.619" end="00:38:03.749" style="s2">largely driven by like hedonism or an</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.019" end="00:38:07.469" style="s2">idea that like such sensual pleasure is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.749" end="00:38:10.619" style="s2">something that should be pursued revered</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.469" end="00:38:13.019" style="s2">sometimes idolized and I recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.619" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">that&#39;s probably just the dominant social</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.019" end="00:38:18.390" style="s2">narrative that&#39;s kind of been implanted</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:21.209" style="s2">and so I I wanted to hear because I hear</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.390" end="00:38:23.759" style="s2">tones of hedonism sometimes and then I</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.209" end="00:38:25.709" style="s2">hear other philosophies and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.759" end="00:38:28.589" style="s2">curious from your perspective what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.709" end="00:38:31.049" style="s2">various philosophies underlying sex work</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.589" end="00:38:33.869" style="s2">are and what your perspective is on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.049" end="00:38:36.150" style="s2">criticisms of vitalizing and like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.869" end="00:38:40.529" style="s2">pursuing sensual pleasure first one that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.150" end="00:38:42.509" style="s2">comes up for me is like Buddhism&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.529" end="00:38:44.459" style="s2">or like early Buddhism&#39;s idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.509" end="00:38:47.039" style="s2">sensual pleasure is like a trap that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.459" end="00:38:49.589" style="s2">gets us trapped and craving and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.039" end="00:38:52.799" style="s2">leads to our suffering so any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.589" end="00:38:54.209" style="s2">you have on that uh yeah actually I like</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.799" end="00:38:55.859" style="s2">that you bring up Buddhism because I</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.209" end="00:38:57.690" style="s2">think Buddhism is like a very fertile</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.859" end="00:39:00.449" style="s2">area to look at like difference by</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.690" end="00:39:01.229" style="s2">sexual perspectives I think that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.449" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.229" end="00:39:07.709" style="s2">Buddhism has this surface level reading</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:09.869" style="s2">of asceticism renunciants saying that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.709" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">there are all of these like bells and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.869" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">whistles all of these fancy toys in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:18.299" style="s2">world that I could use to amuse myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:21.930" style="s2">but that would distract me from curing</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.299" end="00:39:25.049" style="s2">the sickness of suffering and and I am</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.930" end="00:39:28.499" style="s2">very sympathetic to that like mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.049" end="00:39:30.690" style="s2">Buddhists take on making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.499" end="00:39:32.459" style="s2">you&#39;re skeptical about your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.690" end="00:39:34.199" style="s2">with sexual pleasure making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.459" end="00:39:37.199" style="s2">you have like a healthy sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.199" end="00:39:39.329" style="s2">questioning and curiosity around whether</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.199" end="00:39:43.319" style="s2">or not pursuing sexual pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.329" end="00:39:46.650" style="s2">ultimately actually offers you something</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.319" end="00:39:48.390" style="s2">that isn&#39;t like just fleeting and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.650" end="00:39:49.890" style="s2">meaningless I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.390" end="00:39:52.829" style="s2">something that it asks about everything</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.890" end="00:39:54.809" style="s2">which is important I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.829" end="00:39:57.089" style="s2">interesting that also within Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.809" end="00:39:58.979" style="s2">though there there are tantric</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.089" end="00:40:02.430" style="s2">perspectives which say that precisely</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.979" end="00:40:05.370" style="s2">because sensual pleasures are so</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.430" end="00:40:07.790" style="s2">tempting are so distracting are so do</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.370" end="00:40:11.100" style="s2">Andras they also have an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.790" end="00:40:14.970" style="s2">spiritual power available to them if</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.100" end="00:40:19.320" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to look at them as tools</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.970" end="00:40:21.150" style="s2">from a more spiritual way of being it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.320" end="00:40:23.580" style="s2">reminds me actually very much of the use</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.150" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">of entheogens in spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.580" end="00:40:29.430" style="s2">compared to recreational practice I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:32.850" style="s2">think that we have maybe like a picture</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.430" end="00:40:34.860" style="s2">from media of like what a guy on LSD is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.850" end="00:40:36.450" style="s2">like and usually at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.860" end="00:40:39.090" style="s2">scene he talks about jumping out a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.450" end="00:40:40.620" style="s2">window and a bunch of less tripping</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.090" end="00:40:42.750" style="s2">people have to convince him that he</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.620" end="00:40:44.940" style="s2">can&#39;t fly or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.750" end="00:40:49.020" style="s2">that is a way that some people act on</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.940" end="00:40:51.330" style="s2">and fusions but usually there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.020" end="00:40:53.100" style="s2">more emphasis in spiritual communities</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.330" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">on the use of those kinds of substances</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.100" end="00:40:58.530" style="s2">to achieve some sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">self-discovery some sort of connection</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.530" end="00:41:04.530" style="s2">to something beyond yourself beyond even</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:08.040" style="s2">humanity and I think that there is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.530" end="00:41:10.650" style="s2">a profoundly numinous aspect to sensual</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.040" end="00:41:13.620" style="s2">pleasure in general but but sexual</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.650" end="00:41:17.730" style="s2">pleasure especially and we should be as</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.620" end="00:41:20.910" style="s2">curious about the power that we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.730" end="00:41:23.550" style="s2">you know harness for our spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.910" end="00:41:25.830" style="s2">development that is presented by sensual</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.550" end="00:41:28.620" style="s2">desire as we should be about the hazards</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.830" end="00:41:33.870" style="s2">of sensual pleasure in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.620" end="00:41:34.530" style="s2">spiritual development cool Ally you had</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.870" end="00:41:39.300" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.530" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">you still want to ask it may be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.300" end="00:41:45.690" style="s2">touched upon this briefly when she maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">when you talked about the following</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.690" end="00:41:52.320" style="s2">phase you have and you care about their</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:56.250" style="s2">emotional states and this is building up</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.320" end="00:41:59.070" style="s2">on last Friday&#39;s session with Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.250" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">where we discussed somewhat extensively</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.070" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">the emotional the seven basic systems of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:08.670" style="s2">emotions and the lighting system</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:13.320" style="s2">sometimes used synonymously with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.670" end="00:42:16.590" style="s2">lust system and deprivation from this</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.320" end="00:42:19.290" style="s2">system we know results in depression or</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.590" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">I just wanted to know what your</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.290" end="00:42:27.870" style="s2">experience with this this liking system</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.850" style="s2">or being separated from your experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.870" end="00:42:32.190" style="s2">with your online following which I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.850" end="00:42:35.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t know existent until today</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">I mean we&#39;ve been on the few sessions</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.510" end="00:42:41.820" style="s2">for the past few weeks but yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:44.010" style="s2">could you rephrase your question</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.820" end="00:42:46.260" style="s2">straight you&#39;re wondering what I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.010" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">about this kind of separation between me</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.260" end="00:42:51.140" style="s2">and my fan base and whether or not the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:55.530" style="s2">way to their depression or something</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.140" end="00:42:58.710" style="s2">yeah right um I I think that this speaks</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.530" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">a lot to an atomization that is like</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.710" end="00:43:05.670" style="s2">just a crisis across different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">social realms right now I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.670" end="00:43:11.580" style="s2">is really difficult to find alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:13.590" style="s2">I mean especially right now with all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.580" end="00:43:16.740" style="s2">the pandemic measures and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.590" end="00:43:19.020" style="s2">that but even before so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.740" end="00:43:24.330" style="s2">sexual interactions have become mediated</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.020" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">by apps of various kinds and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.330" end="00:43:30.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s something that I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:34.290" style="s2">like to see become a gateway to better</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.840" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">real life sexual intimacy and not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.290" end="00:43:40.290" style="s2">substitute for real life sexual intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.970" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s something that we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.290" end="00:43:44.370" style="s2">really need to build a community around</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.970" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">though I don&#39;t think any one of us can</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.370" end="00:43:49.560" style="s2">change the dating culture by ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:52.080" style="s2">and move it offline again I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.560" end="00:43:54.360" style="s2">it&#39;s going to take a lot of us all being</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.080" end="00:43:57.060" style="s2">very clever about how we can build</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.360" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">bridges from offline or online to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.060" end="00:44:02.340" style="s2">offline communities and how to really</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">show up and be vulnerable in those in</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.340" end="00:44:07.380" style="s2">real-life spaces so that they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:10.770" style="s2">seductive and transformative for people</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.380" end="00:44:12.780" style="s2">and they&#39;ve become like a forceful they</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.770" end="00:44:14.870" style="s2">gain momentum and are able to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.780" end="00:44:17.630" style="s2">themselves the way that it our online</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.870" end="00:44:20.100" style="s2">communities are able to like keep</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.630" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">feeding energy into themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.100" end="00:44:30.350" style="s2">continuing forward into the future cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:30.350" style="s2">and Jen do you want to take onto that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.279" end="00:44:47.549" style="s2">and I you had a question about porn and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.259" end="00:44:48.990" style="s2">hijacking okay maybe there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.549" end="00:44:52.829" style="s2">evolutionary biologist named Bob</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.990" end="00:44:54.750" style="s2">Traverse it&#39;s kind of jargon Inc but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.829" end="00:44:58.019" style="s2">had always resonated with me he had this</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.750" end="00:45:02.190" style="s2">thing where he called Netflix even sugar</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.019" end="00:45:03.690" style="s2">and porn phenotypic hijacking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.190" end="00:45:05.690" style="s2">something that&#39;s taking advantage of her</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.690" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">inbuilt propensity</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.690" end="00:45:11.640" style="s2">I&#39;m curious what&#39;s your reaction to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.349" style="s2">and maybe as a follow-up do you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.640" end="00:45:16.680" style="s2">traverses may be underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.349" end="00:45:19.079" style="s2">today society how it&#39;s lacking a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.680" end="00:45:21.059" style="s2">things that maybe we were used to in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.079" end="00:45:25.049" style="s2">more matched environments in past</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.059" end="00:45:28.380" style="s2">evolution right I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.049" end="00:45:30.150" style="s2">this way there this sort of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.380" end="00:45:32.460" style="s2">content that&#39;s available right now can</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.150" end="00:45:34.950" style="s2">be compared to junk food or things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.460" end="00:45:38.039" style="s2">they&#39;re very very packed with a whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.950" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">bunch of calories and sugar that usually</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.039" end="00:45:43.079" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to be able to like save</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:45.539" style="s2">up and use and get by for a long time on</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.079" end="00:45:49.049" style="s2">instead of just binging on and binging</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.539" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">on and binging on I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.049" end="00:45:52.950" style="s2">right though to note that if we just</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:55.529" style="s2">focus on how hyper stimulating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.950" end="00:45:58.230" style="s2">things that tempt us are we&#39;re not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.529" end="00:46:00.630" style="s2">paying enough attention to why we might</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.230" end="00:46:02.789" style="s2">need these like unbelievably powerful</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.630" end="00:46:04.319" style="s2">sources of stimulation maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.789" end="00:46:06.509" style="s2">because we&#39;re starving</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.319" end="00:46:09.240" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s because in some very real way</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.509" end="00:46:11.970" style="s2">we do need that much nourishment because</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.240" end="00:46:17.160" style="s2">we feel very malnourished in our sexual</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.970" end="00:46:19.920" style="s2">lives I think that we need to like look</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.160" end="00:46:22.500" style="s2">very far back in history and and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.920" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">read the story of our sexual</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.500" end="00:46:27.990" style="s2">relationship with each other as as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:32.849" style="s2">species and and understands that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:34.740" style="s2">been a leg of a dark place and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.849" end="00:46:37.109" style="s2">easy for us to relate to each other on</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.740" end="00:46:39.029" style="s2">this level we&#39;ve been making it up as we</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.109" end="00:46:41.009" style="s2">go along and learning and getting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.029" end="00:46:43.349" style="s2">know each other this whole time and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.009" end="00:46:44.940" style="s2">think that the cultural war really does</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.349" end="00:46:47.339" style="s2">a very good job of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.940" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">hiding from us how hard we have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.339" end="00:46:52.040" style="s2">trying and how much we have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:55.890" style="s2">our best and working together for</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.040" end="00:46:59.010" style="s2">generations to prove communications</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.890" end="00:47:02.550" style="s2">between the the the binary genders that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.010" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">are imposed upon us I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.550" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.109" end="00:47:10.190" style="s2">if I get also asked there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.579" end="00:47:12.810" style="s2">that came up while you were saying that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.190" end="00:47:16.109" style="s2">have you read brave new world and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.810" end="00:47:17.579" style="s2">your reaction to that being the end</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.109" end="00:47:22.349" style="s2">stage a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.579" end="00:47:24.210" style="s2">I haven&#39;t read brave new world um but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.349" end="00:47:26.520" style="s2">think just from it being in the meme</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.210" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">space I understand that it&#39;s not a happy</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.520" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2">story it&#39;s pretty pessimistic is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2">right yeah it takes our utopia shows us</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.460" end="00:47:40.170" style="s2">I&#39;m a fan of pessimism I&#39;m more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.980" end="00:47:41.220" style="s2">with Schopenhauer and his ethics of</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.170" end="00:47:43.410" style="s2">compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.220" end="00:47:45.210" style="s2">Schopenhauer the point about brave new</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.410" end="00:47:47.099" style="s2">world was kind of I guess it was written</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.210" end="00:47:49.079" style="s2">at a time where it must have been crazy</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.099" end="00:47:51.150" style="s2">it&#39;s less crazy today but it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.079" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">everybody&#39;s super sexually liberated and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.150" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">they have like horny for tea parties or</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">they&#39;re just yeah things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:03.410" style="s2">idea when Huxley wrote it this was</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:07.829" style="s2">considered like everybody wanted this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.410" end="00:48:09.300" style="s2">people were so sexually conservative it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.829" end="00:48:11.819" style="s2">is interesting I think that there have</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.300" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">been like weird waves of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.819" end="00:48:16.650" style="s2">conservativism and sexual liberalism but</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:21.030" style="s2">they&#39;ve all kind of required a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.650" end="00:48:24.780" style="s2">synthesis there there&#39;s there&#39;s this way</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.030" end="00:48:28.290" style="s2">that I can see how we match up to like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.780" end="00:48:31.050" style="s2">past fears about what the sexual</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.290" end="00:48:33.690" style="s2">landscape could turn into but I can also</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.050" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">see ways in which those those like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.690" end="00:48:39.480" style="s2">pejorative paintings of the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:42.030" style="s2">we live in now are just like glossing</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.480" end="00:48:43.589" style="s2">over all of the escape routes we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.030" end="00:48:46.349" style="s2">from this kind of culture I think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.589" end="00:48:49.319" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of opportunities to break</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.349" end="00:48:52.740" style="s2">out of like the narrow idea of the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.319" end="00:48:56.599" style="s2">sexualized modernity we just have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.740" end="00:48:56.599" style="s2">willing to be more creative and all this</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.390" end="00:49:04.020" style="s2">cool I&#39;m gonna circle back to Raines</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.370" end="00:49:10.150" style="s2">question range still want to ask it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.020" end="00:49:14.260" style="s2">sure hi thanks for being on here my</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.150" end="00:49:16.090" style="s2">question well I have two questions the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.260" end="00:49:18.220" style="s2">first one is is kind of vague</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.090" end="00:49:22.150" style="s2">intentionally but just curious your</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.220" end="00:49:24.730" style="s2">thoughts about non-binary and queer sex</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.150" end="00:49:25.450" style="s2">work like what&#39;s the status of that what</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.730" end="00:49:28.690" style="s2">do you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.450" end="00:49:33.540" style="s2">online around that and then my second</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.690" end="00:49:40.270" style="s2">question is kind of in the realm of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.540" end="00:49:45.430" style="s2">heteronormativity of like is the buying</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.270" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">power of straight men influencing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.430" end="00:49:49.540" style="s2">way that sex work is framed and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:52.900" style="s2">understood and how the platforms are</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.540" end="00:49:55.930" style="s2">designed and I mean that as a as a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.900" end="00:49:59.460" style="s2">open question more than an accusation</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.930" end="00:50:01.840" style="s2">and yeah curious to hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.460" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">um to the first point</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.840" end="00:50:08.050" style="s2">I find that a gender non-conforming sex</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:09.580" style="s2">work is not super visible to me I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.050" end="00:50:11.350" style="s2">it has a lot to do with the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.580" end="00:50:14.500" style="s2">culture war is set up right now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.350" end="00:50:17.260" style="s2">a lot of sensationalism around men and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.500" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">women and the the only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.260" end="00:50:20.290" style="s2">discussions that we have in the meme</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:24.100" style="s2">space going on around gender</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.290" end="00:50:27.150" style="s2">non-conforming people are frankly not</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.100" end="00:50:29.590" style="s2">sexy they have to do a lot with like</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.150" end="00:50:31.330" style="s2">making sure you have your pronouns or</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.590" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">making sure that you know your labels</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.330" end="00:50:35.110" style="s2">and they&#39;re very confusing for straight</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:37.270" style="s2">people they&#39;re very confusing for</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.110" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">questioning people frankly it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.270" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">like they&#39;re quite confusing for gender</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:45.210" style="s2">non-conforming people themselves I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:48.130" style="s2">that the picture that people get of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.210" end="00:50:50.680" style="s2">non-conforming sex work is is too</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.130" end="00:50:54.130" style="s2">squishy and confusing and like trapped</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.680" end="00:50:56.500" style="s2">in the collateral damage field of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.130" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">culture war zone so it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.500" end="00:50:59.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get like the spotlight it</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.300" style="s2">deserves and I think that&#39;s so sad</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.890" end="00:51:04.540" style="s2">because I think gender non-conforming</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.300" end="00:51:05.980" style="s2">artists are so hot and they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.540" end="00:51:08.230" style="s2">such interesting things with their work</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.980" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">and the couple that I know person</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.230" end="00:51:12.730" style="s2">so that I do get like exposed to their</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">artwork blow me away and influenced me a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.730" end="00:51:17.740" style="s2">lot and so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s too bad</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:19.320" style="s2">that this platform isn&#39;t doing for them</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.740" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">what it&#39;s doing for people like me</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.320" end="00:51:25.630" style="s2">because it totally could if we changed</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:28.900" style="s2">the mimetic landscape to your second</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.630" end="00:51:31.780" style="s2">point it&#39;s interesting I absolutely see</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.900" end="00:51:33.640" style="s2">this like heterosexism insects work</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.780" end="00:51:36.910" style="s2">whether it&#39;s pornhub or only fans or</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.640" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">anywhere else and and to link back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.910" end="00:51:40.270" style="s2">your other question I do think again it</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:43.359" style="s2">has a lot to do with the way that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.270" end="00:51:46.420" style="s2">culture wars sensationalizes gender as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.359" end="00:51:49.290" style="s2">binary or maybe not like question mark</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.420" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">question mark question mark and so i</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.290" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">think that it that it encourages men in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">particular to almost like spite consume</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:04.570" style="s2">women&#39;s content a lot of the time and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:07.900" style="s2">also I think inspires women to Speight</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.570" end="00:52:10.829" style="s2">produce adult content because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.900" end="00:52:13.420" style="s2">this like adversarial transactional</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.829" end="00:52:16.300" style="s2">competitive sort of atmosphere within</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.420" end="00:52:20.200" style="s2">and between genders a lot of the time I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.300" end="00:52:22.359" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I would call that like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.200" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">something that&#39;s spurred on by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.359" end="00:52:28.300" style="s2">buying power of heterosexual men I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:30.579" style="s2">it has more to do with the parameters of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.300" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">the sex work industry and how they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.579" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">influenced by social and sexual</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:38.530" style="s2">limitations that are imposed on all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:41.619" style="s2">us I think that there could be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.530" end="00:52:45.310" style="s2">more interesting porn that is a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.619" end="00:52:48.460" style="s2">like raw and evocative to basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.310" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">everybody but there&#39;s just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.460" end="00:52:54.099" style="s2">tiling structure there&#39;s this acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:55.630" style="s2">kind of adult content that it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.099" end="00:52:57.690" style="s2">already out there and it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.630" end="00:53:00.700" style="s2">momentum behind it and it keeps getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.690" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">made over and over and over again the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.700" end="00:53:05.619" style="s2">wheel gets reinvented and men keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:07.750" style="s2">buying it and it keeps being unsexy to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.619" end="00:53:10.270" style="s2">people outside of that little sis het</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.750" end="00:53:12.579" style="s2">Mille sphere and I think it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.270" end="00:53:14.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just a Moloch problem porn</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.579" end="00:53:16.839" style="s2">could be way better for everybody but</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.440" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not because of the regular</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.839" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">practical miss incentives</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.970" end="00:53:29.710" style="s2">cool rain DME follow-up to that no that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.950" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">was great thank you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.710" end="00:53:39.410" style="s2">key you have a question hi maybe great</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:40.130" style="s2">thank you for a lot of late you spoke</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.410" end="00:53:43.010" style="s2">about today</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.130" end="00:53:48.339" style="s2">um I think that it is really important</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.010" end="00:53:52.910" style="s2">to tap into what is good with in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.339" end="00:53:57.079" style="s2">sexualities and unleash that in the ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.910" end="00:54:01.000" style="s2">that you&#39;ve described so and yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.079" end="00:54:03.829" style="s2">learned a lot but my question is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.000" end="00:54:07.450" style="s2">principles do you use to be aware of or</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.829" end="00:54:12.460" style="s2">combat exploitation on either side so</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.450" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">the sex worker versus the consumer I</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.460" end="00:54:15.950" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:17.950" style="s2">question and I think it&#39;s one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.950" end="00:54:22.190" style="s2">gonna be difficult for me to answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.950" end="00:54:24.349" style="s2">because the the norms and the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.190" end="00:54:27.230" style="s2">that I&#39;ve developed around producing</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.349" end="00:54:31.490" style="s2">adult content have evolved and emerged</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.230" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">really naturally over time one thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.490" end="00:54:39.170" style="s2">that I think has helped me on my journey</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:42.819" style="s2">as being an adult content creator is</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.170" end="00:54:48.200" style="s2">having an attitude of starting slow and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.819" end="00:54:51.170" style="s2">uh and expanding with my comfort level I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.200" end="00:54:53.720" style="s2">think that a lot of women are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.170" end="00:54:55.819" style="s2">offered opportunities to make content</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.720" end="00:54:59.270" style="s2">that&#39;s more explicit than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.819" end="00:55:00.770" style="s2">initially ready to make and they maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.270" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">feel like they need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.770" end="00:55:06.020" style="s2">opportunity before really sitting with</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.440" style="s2">themselves and deciding what&#39;s fun for</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.020" end="00:55:13.309" style="s2">them and where the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.440" end="00:55:16.910" style="s2">exhibitionism for them are I was lucky</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.309" end="00:55:19.130" style="s2">to find really good mentors early on in</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.910" end="00:55:22.040" style="s2">the adult content community who helped</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.130" end="00:55:25.730" style="s2">me make good decisions about going slow</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.040" end="00:55:27.950" style="s2">and respecting myself in the sex work</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.730" end="00:55:29.990" style="s2">field but I think there there definitely</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.950" end="00:55:31.790" style="s2">need to be more figures out there like</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.990" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">that for women like me who are just</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.790" end="00:55:37.609" style="s2">getting started to encourage people to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.140" style="s2">take it at their own pace and and make</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.609" end="00:55:42.019" style="s2">sure they&#39;re checking in with their</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.140" end="00:55:44.450" style="s2">bodies physically to see what&#39;s arousing</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.019" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">to them because this doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.450" end="00:55:50.660" style="s2">transactional for women or other genders</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:53.089" style="s2">that decide to make adult content it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.210" end="00:59:28.690" style="s2">of pejorative understanding of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.810" end="00:59:32.170" style="s2">who masturbate and use porn or have</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.170" end="00:59:37.940" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m a uniquely open-minded person</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">but even if I am I think the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.940" end="00:59:42.380" style="s2">can be this open about being that open</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:43.730" style="s2">minded means that at least some of the</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.060" end="01:00:01.240" style="s2">content I think that there isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.050" end="01:00:04.080" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.240" end="01:00:08.020" style="s2">to judge somebody&#39;s sex life without</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.080" end="01:00:11.890" style="s2">expressing your own sexual insecurity I</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.020" end="01:00:14.590" style="s2">think that when we are genuinely assured</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.890" end="01:00:17.830" style="s2">in our own sexual practices and sexual</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.590" end="01:00:20.020" style="s2">beings and someone else lives out a</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.020" end="01:00:24.910" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t appeal to us we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:27.730" style="s2">actually get very much of a disgust</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.910" end="01:00:30.070" style="s2">response or an urge to judge I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.730" end="01:00:31.630" style="s2">that when we&#39;re feeling really secure in</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.070" end="01:00:33.369" style="s2">ourselves and other people do things</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.630" end="01:00:35.170" style="s2">that aren&#39;t interesting to us we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.369" end="01:00:37.000" style="s2">excited for them to be exploring their</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.170" end="01:00:39.220" style="s2">interests and excited to explore other</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.000" end="01:00:42.190" style="s2">interests ourselves I think that we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.220" end="01:00:45.490" style="s2">to be really skeptical of our urge to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.190" end="01:00:49.450" style="s2">look at anybody&#39;s sexual practices and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.490" end="01:00:54.630" style="s2">assume that they are unhealthy or that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.450" end="01:00:54.630" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t be enjoyable for anybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.580" end="01:01:03.750" style="s2">great Tom you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:11.220" style="s2">yes sorry I I really have to go in like</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.780" end="01:01:13.410" style="s2">five minutes so I won&#39;t have time to</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.220" end="01:01:16.680" style="s2">hear the answer but I will listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.410" end="01:01:18.450" style="s2">on YouTube if it&#39;s in the video this was</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.680" end="01:01:22.589" style="s2">building up a little bit on Hanna&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.450" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">comment on comparison with switch and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.589" end="01:01:27.300" style="s2">really struck me is that this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.550" style="s2">comparison really struck me and I saw</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.300" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">this what she said is that you can you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.550" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">can have this kind of Trojan horses</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:40.910" style="s2">which basically you get inside well uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">Trojan horse and what I wanted to ask is</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.910" end="01:01:46.440" style="s2">basically you have this two side where</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:48.839" style="s2">you can use Zeus Trojan horse too for</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.440" end="01:01:53.880" style="s2">good for example or for bad as Tyson</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.839" end="01:01:56.430" style="s2">said and from your point of view you see</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.880" end="01:02:00.060" style="s2">the difference basically and what can</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.430" end="01:02:02.099" style="s2">you do to influence those consumers on</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.060" end="01:02:04.050" style="s2">which side they will fall basically will</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.099" end="01:02:06.450" style="s2">they just be addictive and lose that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.050" end="01:02:10.050" style="s2">time and will they get kind of hacked</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.450" end="01:02:14.250" style="s2">into this nefarious situation or can you</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.050" end="01:02:15.720" style="s2">improve the situation I think this is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.250" end="01:02:17.490" style="s2">awesome question I hope that you get to</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.720" end="01:02:19.700" style="s2">hear at least some of it but I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.490" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">that you&#39;ll tune in later if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.700" end="01:02:23.849" style="s2">well I do think that it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.680" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">something that I have this meta</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.849" end="01:02:29.940" style="s2">awareness about that this could be used</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:33.480" style="s2">as easily for good as for evil and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.940" end="01:02:36.150" style="s2">think that uh having strong boundaries</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.369" end="01:02:48.930" style="s2">find that if somebody is engaging with</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.770" end="01:03:33.390" style="s2">regular social context there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:36.600" style="s2">that we think of as leading people on I</p>

<p begin="01:03:55.170" end="01:03:59.610" style="s2">to me about like the vulnerabilities</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.990" end="01:04:01.140" style="s2">that they feel or the fantasies that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.610" end="01:04:02.850" style="s2">they have that they don&#39;t feel like they</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.800" end="01:04:11.670" style="s2">about that vulnerability and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.210" end="01:04:13.770" style="s2">see more about those unmet needs for</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.670" end="01:04:15.600" style="s2">sexual expression and see if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.770" end="01:04:17.250" style="s2">way that I can offer an outlet that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.600" end="01:04:20.910" style="s2">aligns with the work that I&#39;m doing in</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.250" end="01:04:23.820" style="s2">my life anyway um sometimes there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.910" end="01:04:27.060" style="s2">you know the 1% of times where I just</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.820" end="01:04:29.660" style="s2">absolutely click with somebody and they</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.060" end="01:04:32.970" style="s2">enter this space as an adult content</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.660" end="01:04:35.970" style="s2">consumer and now they are my very best</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.970" end="01:04:37.830" style="s2">friend and that&#39;s super exciting too and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.970" end="01:04:39.570" style="s2">then they get a whole bunch of quality</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.830" end="01:04:40.800" style="s2">time and attention from me and that can</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.570" end="01:04:42.300" style="s2">look a whole bunch of different ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.800" end="01:04:44.580" style="s2">depending on the kind of connection that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.300" end="01:04:46.770" style="s2">we have but there really is that really</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.580" end="01:04:48.900" style="s2">wide spectrum and the main way that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.770" end="01:04:50.870" style="s2">keep myself safe and keep other people</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.900" end="01:04:53.160" style="s2">safe is by having the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.870" end="01:04:55.170" style="s2">quality and amount of attention like</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.160" end="01:04:57.660" style="s2">distributed at different levels of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.170" end="01:05:07.230" style="s2">sort of like intimacy level of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.660" end="01:05:10.110" style="s2">interaction Walter I think you had a</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.230" end="01:05:13.770" style="s2">question that we missed at the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.110" end="01:05:17.910" style="s2">beginning ok thank you thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.770" end="01:05:20.040" style="s2">taking a question yeah you actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.910" end="01:05:22.080" style="s2">spoke very well to a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.040" end="01:05:25.470" style="s2">points but it&#39;s something that I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.080" end="01:05:27.420" style="s2">might keep coming up so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.470" end="01:05:28.950" style="s2">different internet groups that would</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.420" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">have led a lot of people to a group like</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.950" end="01:05:33.980" style="s2">this one the stoah they used to we used</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:36.920" style="s2">to spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.980" end="01:05:38.750" style="s2">about religion and fortunately those</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.920" end="01:05:40.460" style="s2">arguments kind of toned down a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.750" end="01:05:43.460" style="s2">bit and they&#39;ve become more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.460" end="01:05:46.100" style="s2">in my own opinion and then it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.460" end="01:05:49.210" style="s2">the next thing that could really divide</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.100" end="01:05:52.130" style="s2">people would be sexuality for example</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.210" end="01:05:54.200" style="s2">when people host these sorts of events</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.130" end="01:05:56.030" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like the moderator almost</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.200" end="01:05:58.520" style="s2">has to eventually take a stand on</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.030" end="01:06:01.940" style="s2">whether we&#39;re kind of a pro monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.520" end="01:06:03.859" style="s2">sort of a community or a pro polyamory</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.940" end="01:06:05.630" style="s2">sort of a community or a pro corn or an</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.859" end="01:06:09.170" style="s2">anti porn because those things are gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.630" end="01:06:10.850" style="s2">keep coming up I think it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.170" end="01:06:12.380" style="s2">that it could come to a place where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.850" end="01:06:14.119" style="s2">more like a live and let live and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.380" end="01:06:16.490" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a balanced understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.119" end="01:06:18.859" style="s2">that people come to different worldviews</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.490" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know do you have any sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.859" end="01:06:23.060" style="s2">of how long that might take or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:24.619" style="s2">just gonna completely split a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.060" end="01:06:25.970" style="s2">these groups because a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.619" end="01:06:27.890" style="s2">come to these groups without strong an</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.970" end="01:06:30.380" style="s2">anti-authoritarian bent but also a</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.890" end="01:06:34.460" style="s2">curiosity about the benefits of older</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.380" end="01:06:36.109" style="s2">traditions absolutely really do that I</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.460" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">think that that&#39;s something that I see</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.109" end="01:06:41.240" style="s2">is like a commonality that goes through</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:43.609" style="s2">a lot of people in the you know meta</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.240" end="01:06:44.960" style="s2">rational community this like idea of</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.609" end="01:06:46.940" style="s2">like oh there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.960" end="01:06:48.560" style="s2">important about traditions but we could</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.940" end="01:06:51.170" style="s2">be totally different oh yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.560" end="01:06:53.000" style="s2">and I love that I love that we feel so</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.170" end="01:06:57.140" style="s2">strongly and both of these like</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.000" end="01:07:00.290" style="s2">seemingly like tense directions um I</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.140" end="01:07:02.390" style="s2">think that the opinion I have on this</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.290" end="01:07:05.300" style="s2">issue is an opinion I have on a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.390" end="01:07:07.760" style="s2">like divisive political and mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.300" end="01:07:11.270" style="s2">issues which is that the the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.760" end="01:07:15.890" style="s2">that we approach the discourse with this</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.270" end="01:07:17.810" style="s2">identitarian lens people have lots of</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.890" end="01:07:20.060" style="s2">really strong feelings about monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.810" end="01:07:22.250" style="s2">and polyamory because though those are</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.060" end="01:07:26.510" style="s2">presented to them as categories of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.250" end="01:07:29.420" style="s2">people that they can choose to be and if</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.510" end="01:07:33.410" style="s2">they were presented to them as what they</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.420" end="01:07:35.390" style="s2">are which is tools like along a spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.410" end="01:07:38.180" style="s2">that can help you shape your</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.390" end="01:07:40.490" style="s2">relationship structures in ways that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.180" end="01:07:42.530" style="s2">know maximize the Fremen and enjoyment</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.490" end="01:07:45.950" style="s2">for everybody involved in them I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.530" end="01:07:47.750" style="s2">that they would be a lot less divisive</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.950" end="01:07:50.180" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t suit the culture war at</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.750" end="01:07:52.280" style="s2">all so the culture war isn&#39;t gonna help</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.180" end="01:07:54.109" style="s2">us out on that we&#39;re gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.280" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">the resistance to the culture war and</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.109" end="01:08:00.680" style="s2">bring in this kind of lenss mentality to</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">replace the identitarian mentality and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.680" end="01:08:05.690" style="s2">then I think it&#39;s just it&#39;s amazing how</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:08.680" style="s2">quickly the tensions dissolve when</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.690" end="01:08:12.049" style="s2">you&#39;re not being asked to pick a tribe</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.680" end="01:08:14.210" style="s2">as soon as you&#39;re not like choosing a</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.049" end="01:08:15.859" style="s2">team you can just be like oh yeah I can</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.210" end="01:08:18.100" style="s2">see how both of these would be good for</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.859" end="01:08:20.540" style="s2">different people in different situations</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.100" end="01:08:25.460" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know why people fight about</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.540" end="01:08:28.969" style="s2">it cool so this will probably be our</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.460" end="01:08:30.109" style="s2">last question comment Mac I know you had</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.969" end="01:08:32.210" style="s2">something burning I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.109" end="01:08:35.150" style="s2">asked it in the chat room but you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.210" end="01:08:36.620" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask it now yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.150" end="01:08:40.370" style="s2">was I was inspired by your question</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.620" end="01:08:43.310" style="s2">period of nofap of this concept of nofap</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.370" end="01:08:44.630" style="s2">and maybe gave an amazing response to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.310" end="01:08:47.509" style="s2">that and I wanted to actually draw a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.630" end="01:08:50.509" style="s2">contrast by proposing a fun little</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.509" end="01:08:52.609" style="s2">hypothetical of what about a concept</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.509" end="01:08:54.440" style="s2">like all FAP we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.609" end="01:08:56.890" style="s2">masturbating 20 times a day we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.440" end="01:09:01.279" style="s2">talking about very very weak orgasms</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.890" end="01:09:03.799" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a serious serious</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.279" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">interest in pornography and as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.799" end="01:09:10.219" style="s2">consumer and I was open um maybe be</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:12.410" style="s2">interesting to see what you say just</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.219" end="01:09:16.250" style="s2">just flipping that that concept of what</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.410" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">your reaction to that would be yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.250" end="01:09:20.359" style="s2">think I think this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:22.370" style="s2">point for me of like the the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.359" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">mainstream Buddhism compared to tantric</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.370" end="01:09:27.739" style="s2">Buddhism I think that you you can you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:30.620" style="s2">can commit yourself to being celibate</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.739" end="01:09:33.080" style="s2">and that is such a strong position to</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.620" end="01:09:35.150" style="s2">take and it&#39;s such a commitment and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.080" end="01:09:38.449" style="s2">takes so much investment and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.150" end="01:09:40.969" style="s2">um like an act of devotion whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.449" end="01:09:44.179" style="s2">to yourself or to a higher power or just</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.969" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">to the life that you want to live and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.179" end="01:09:48.770" style="s2">think that you can absolutely like find</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:50.719" style="s2">that same way of being and pendulum</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.770" end="01:09:53.719" style="s2">swing it all the way to the other side</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.719" end="01:09:56.840" style="s2">and be like no I want to understand</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.719" end="01:09:58.040" style="s2">myself is the sexual being so so deeply</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.840" end="01:10:01.420" style="s2">that I am willing</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.040" end="01:10:03.650" style="s2">to make like my month about</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.420" end="01:10:06.050" style="s2">investigating what turns me on and what</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.650" end="01:10:08.030" style="s2">turns me off what that&#39;s like in my body</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.050" end="01:10:11.210" style="s2">what that says about the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.030" end="01:10:13.570" style="s2">reality and how it&#39;s like unconsciously</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.210" end="01:10:16.430" style="s2">influencing the way that I interact in</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.570" end="01:10:19.190" style="s2">seemingly non-sexual contexts I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.430" end="01:10:21.650" style="s2">that there is like such a rich spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.190" end="01:10:23.930" style="s2">mystery that we can like put our</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.650" end="01:10:26.990" style="s2">detectives hats on and go out and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.930" end="01:10:29.690" style="s2">exploring if we decide that sexual</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.990" end="01:10:37.180" style="s2">pleasure is as numinous and interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.690" end="01:10:44.600" style="s2">as sexual restraint do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.180" end="01:10:46.340" style="s2">questions to that Beck oh no no I I was</p>

<p begin="01:10:46.340" end="01:10:51.620" style="s2">I think I think your perspective is</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.930" end="01:10:53.510" style="s2">exactly what is needed and and I was I</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.620" end="01:10:56.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what we were going to get</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.510" end="01:11:00.380" style="s2">into I&#39;m talking about sex work here at</p>

<p begin="01:11:09.710" end="01:11:17.630" style="s2">but actually I&#39;m really looking at how</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.320" end="01:11:19.640" style="s2">phallus is expressed and how the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.630" end="01:11:22.940" style="s2">female form is expressed and how those</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.640" end="01:11:25.250" style="s2">two interact and then is absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.940" end="01:11:27.170" style="s2">fascinating if you take it seriously and</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.250" end="01:11:29.450" style="s2">not just a mass vitória 8 or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.170" end="01:11:31.850" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I hear in your voice and</p>

<p begin="01:12:07.850" end="01:12:11.719" style="s2">kinship with the role of temple</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.130" end="01:12:15.949" style="s2">prostitute why</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.719" end="01:12:18.530" style="s2">simple prostitute was or is a role that</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.949" end="01:12:20.870" style="s2">fit with like traditional ways of</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.530" end="01:12:23.540" style="s2">connecting with religious practice</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.870" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">through physical intimacy and then the</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.540" end="01:12:30.050" style="s2">therapists role is like modernist</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:32.930" style="s2">practice of like structured emotional</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.050" end="01:12:38.920" style="s2">intimacy and is there kind of like meta</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.930" end="01:12:41.690" style="s2">modern tantric philosopher role emerging</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.920" end="01:12:44.239" style="s2">yeah absolutely actually this definitely</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.690" end="01:12:47.810" style="s2">hits on like a passion of mine</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:49.790" style="s2">I have religious studies kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.810" end="01:12:52.160" style="s2">background and so I particularly like</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.790" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">East Asian Buddhism and they have this</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.160" end="01:12:59.000" style="s2">concept of the miko who is a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:13:01.850" style="s2">like spiritual medium and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.000" end="01:13:06.010" style="s2">sexual temptation at the same time in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.850" end="01:13:12.590" style="s2">buddhist spheres and I find that very</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.010" end="01:13:15.500" style="s2">very poetic I think that we we have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.590" end="01:13:18.469" style="s2">very long conversation that&#39;s been going</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.500" end="01:13:20.090" style="s2">on about patriarchy and and what it</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.469" end="01:13:23.750" style="s2">means and what to do about it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.090" end="01:13:29.570" style="s2">sometimes I like to think about well</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.750" end="01:13:31.610" style="s2">what maybe the good aspects of having a</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.570" end="01:13:32.989" style="s2">power dynamic are not so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.610" end="01:13:35.719" style="s2">keep it in place but spilitt we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.989" end="01:13:37.699" style="s2">appreciate what we have been gaining</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.719" end="01:13:41.449" style="s2">from it spiritually as it&#39;s been playing</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.699" end="01:13:47.390" style="s2">out and I think that um the the Miko it</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.449" end="01:13:51.290" style="s2">is is is providing a perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.390" end="01:13:54.380" style="s2">that is a practical physical but also</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.290" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">poetic and and paranormal there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.380" end="01:13:59.449" style="s2">something absolutely magic about it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:01.850" style="s2">I think that it also reminds me very</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.449" end="01:14:05.030" style="s2">much of the the paintings of the nine</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.850" end="01:14:06.530" style="s2">stages of decay I wrote a paper on these</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.030" end="01:14:09.469" style="s2">east asian buddhist paintings that</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.530" end="01:14:13.580" style="s2">portray the the corpse of a woman in</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.469" end="01:14:16.340" style="s2">nine stages as she decays and is you</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.580" end="01:14:19.160" style="s2">know reduced to a skeleton and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.340" end="01:14:22.910" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a grave marker at the end</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.160" end="01:14:24.590" style="s2">if anything and there&#39;s this beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.910" end="01:14:27.830" style="s2">beautiful notion</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.590" end="01:14:31.300" style="s2">I think that is conveyed by the use of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.830" end="01:14:34.130" style="s2">woman&#39;s corpse in particular because</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.300" end="01:14:36.260" style="s2">women have unbounded bodies they</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.130" end="01:14:40.460" style="s2">magistrates they have this relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.260" end="01:14:43.580" style="s2">that is less bounded and more diffuse in</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.460" end="01:14:47.300" style="s2">the material world and that goes counter</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.580" end="01:14:51.219" style="s2">to the mainstream Buddhist values of</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.300" end="01:14:54.500" style="s2">being closed and contained and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.219" end="01:14:58.010" style="s2">complete in a way and there&#39;s this way</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.500" end="01:15:02.840" style="s2">that we can subvert these purity and</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.010" end="01:15:05.360" style="s2">impurity dynamics and use what is seen</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.840" end="01:15:07.580" style="s2">as an inherent relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.360" end="01:15:10.849" style="s2">impurity because of the structure of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.580" end="01:15:15.619" style="s2">certain kind of body and and show how</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.849" end="01:15:18.770" style="s2">that can be a mentor to two people who</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.619" end="01:15:21.110" style="s2">have idealized bodies and and how</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.770" end="01:15:23.659" style="s2">there&#39;s like an educational relationship</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.110" end="01:15:26.060" style="s2">between being idealized and being</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.659" end="01:15:28.369" style="s2">demonized and that by putting each other</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.060" end="01:15:30.409" style="s2">in these roles we have actually been</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.369" end="01:15:33.469" style="s2">playing a grand sort of spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.409" end="01:15:37.300" style="s2">experiment that we&#39;ll have to understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.469" end="01:15:41.810" style="s2">before we can start playing a new one</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.300" end="01:15:42.619" style="s2">Wow okay good good stuff there let&#39;s end</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.810" end="01:15:44.630" style="s2">it here</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.619" end="01:15:46.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll make some closing announcements but</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.630" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">maybe you have any kind of closing</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.310" end="01:15:51.980" style="s2">thoughts for us um only that I&#39;m</p>
