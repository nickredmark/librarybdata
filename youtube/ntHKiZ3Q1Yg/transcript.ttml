<p begin="00:00:07.740" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">at least that I&#39;ve been having is to be</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:37.270" style="s2">forget that we are participants</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.840" end="00:00:39.070" style="s2">to think that we&#39;re consumers or voters</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.270" end="00:00:41.290" style="s2">something else we own our disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.070" end="00:00:43.030" style="s2">here on this world and we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.290" end="00:00:45.370" style="s2">sacred world where we can live in a flat</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.030" end="00:00:47.260" style="s2">world or we can live in a materialist</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.370" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">world we get to participate in that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.260" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">any case</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">hello and welcome to the next episode of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:55.589" style="s2">voice club my name is Tim Adeline and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">this is a conversation with Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.589" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">Thorson Daniel is the host of the emerge</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:03.839" style="s2">podcast which has become a really really</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">pivotal podcast I think for collating a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.839" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">whole range of really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">thinkers it tracks the themes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">civilizational collapse and what we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">do about that from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">civilization design but importantly it</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">also brings that element of personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">transformation how we can transform</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">ourselves and in so doing transform the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">world it&#39;s not looking at it from an</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:26.039" style="s2">either/or perspective it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:29.659" style="s2">from a mode of we are deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.039" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">the world and how we develop ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.659" end="00:01:35.580" style="s2">is also inherently related to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:40.709" style="s2">systems we interact with and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.580" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">therefore how we can make the world you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.709" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">know I&#39;m not making that point</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">particularly well there that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:48.330" style="s2">this introduction is about suffice to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">say that&#39;s a way of thinking that also</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.330" end="00:01:52.709" style="s2">resonates strongly with this project and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">ultimately with the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.709" end="00:01:57.090" style="s2">outlook that underlies some of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">exploration here and also many of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.090" end="00:02:01.800" style="s2">conversations in this project</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:04.709" style="s2">now there are two parts to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.800" end="00:02:07.679" style="s2">conversation and the first part is sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.709" end="00:02:10.379" style="s2">mostly an outside-in look at what</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.679" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">Daniels taken to emerge so far on his</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.379" end="00:02:14.849" style="s2">podcast inquiry which i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">interesting but but the second part is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.849" end="00:02:19.319" style="s2">to me even more interesting it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:23.099" style="s2">felt that way to engage in it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.319" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">closer to the core impulse of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.099" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">project which is to really engage in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:29.459" style="s2">transformative conversations perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:33.230" style="s2">those from an inside out perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.459" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">really feeling your way into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.230" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">philosophical exploration we talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:43.110" style="s2">about Omni win and how to understand its</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.760" end="00:02:45.239" style="s2">how to understand it whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.110" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">should in fact be understood as an omni</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.239" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">growth way of conceptualizing systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:55.709" style="s2">interaction you know when is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:56.510" style="s2">appropriate to lose is it a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.709" end="00:02:59.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.510" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">we also talk about soul making and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:03.450" style="s2">deep importance of participation but</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">most of all it&#39;s a dialogue that flowed</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.450" end="00:03:12.330" style="s2">and one that well I hope I hope I hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:15.570" style="s2">you find interesting and I hope actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.330" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">that it can be inspirational to some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.570" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">you who are looking to involve yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">more in in the world but from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">perspective where you can do so really</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:39.210" style="s2">grounded in yourself and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">to say there but in a certain mode of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.210" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">listening and in a certain mode of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">expression in a relationship self seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">to reveal itself reveals itself other</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:58.290" style="s2">ways to but can be a beautiful thing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:02.030" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.290" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">so Daniel introduces himself shortly he</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.030" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">lives in a monastery it&#39;s called their</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:08.790" style="s2">monastic Academy it&#39;s based in Vermont</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:12.390" style="s2">and fundamentally the monastic Academy</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.790" end="00:04:16.230" style="s2">and as Daniel describes it is as they</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">describe their own mission is for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.230" end="00:04:22.980" style="s2">preservation of life on Earth which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">which is a an exceptionally heavy load</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.980" end="00:04:34.500" style="s2">and seems to me necessary it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">thing to sit with so yeah I will see you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.500" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">very shortly</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.599" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">whether you&#39;re watching on YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.309" end="00:04:43.669" style="s2">listening as a podcast remember to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">subscribe and hit the bell to track</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.669" end="00:04:54.289" style="s2">upcoming releases myself alright Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:56.599" style="s2">Thorson thank you so much for for being</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.289" end="00:04:58.789" style="s2">here and entering into this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.599" end="00:05:00.679" style="s2">with me yeah pleasure to speak with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.789" end="00:05:05.379" style="s2">I&#39;ve really enjoyed our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.679" end="00:05:09.649" style="s2">yeah I have been following your work for</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.379" end="00:05:12.879" style="s2">I think possibly around around about a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.649" end="00:05:16.939" style="s2">year give or take a few months I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.879" end="00:05:20.149" style="s2">all of a sudden things start to blur a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.939" end="00:05:24.110" style="s2">little bit when it comes to tracking so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.149" end="00:05:26.779" style="s2">many of the elements within some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:31.159" style="s2">subculture that I think we share a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.779" end="00:05:33.589" style="s2">mutual interest in certainly you are to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.159" end="00:05:35.990" style="s2">me a really key player in bringing</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.589" end="00:05:39.619" style="s2">together really interesting voices and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.990" end="00:05:42.499" style="s2">adding to the discussion in a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.619" end="00:05:47.209" style="s2">way and what I&#39;m hoping today to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.499" end="00:05:50.569" style="s2">about is what you see that discussion as</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.209" end="00:05:55.129" style="s2">like how you&#39;ve seen it emerge of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.569" end="00:05:57.319" style="s2">your podcast is called emerge and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.129" end="00:05:58.849" style="s2">perhaps you know if you could take a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.319" end="00:06:01.699" style="s2">moments just to introduce yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.849" end="00:06:03.589" style="s2">briefly and then also talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.699" end="00:06:07.849" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and then we can go into</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.589" end="00:06:12.979" style="s2">perhaps what you see emerging yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.849" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">sure so yeah I guess the the short kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.979" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">of current bio is as he said I host a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:22.759" style="s2">podcast called emerge it&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:24.559" style="s2">for about two and a half years or so</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.759" end="00:06:27.529" style="s2">although I took a little break in there</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.559" end="00:06:29.899" style="s2">somewhere and I also live at a place</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.529" end="00:06:32.599" style="s2">called the monastic Academy where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.899" end="00:06:35.119" style="s2">train full-time in a kind of monastic ly</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.599" end="00:06:37.009" style="s2">inspired training center where we spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.119" end="00:06:39.110" style="s2">a lot of time and silent meditation we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.009" end="00:06:41.059" style="s2">do a practice called circling we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.110" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">trauma healing we do personal like peer</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.059" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">coaching and here I&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:49.160" style="s2">training and then I&#39;m also helping</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:52.970" style="s2">design a new curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.160" end="00:06:55.180" style="s2">attempting to kind of ground some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.970" end="00:06:58.280" style="s2">ideas I&#39;ve been exploring on my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.180" end="00:07:01.400" style="s2">into an educational context and try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.280" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">train people for the kind of world that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.400" end="00:07:07.010" style="s2">I think both you and I sort of hope is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:10.970" style="s2">coming see coming you know what I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.010" end="00:07:14.990" style="s2">to help nudge into being right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.970" end="00:07:18.110" style="s2">kind of the short bio and then the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.990" end="00:07:20.390" style="s2">the podcast man it&#39;s hard to say what it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.110" end="00:07:22.010" style="s2">is I think you know I started it because</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.390" end="00:07:24.200" style="s2">there were certain conversations that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.010" end="00:07:26.510" style="s2">wanted to hear I&#39;ve always listened to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.200" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">podcast or like you know much of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.510" end="00:07:32.090" style="s2">adult life it&#39;s been a major way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:33.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned and I&#39;ve kept waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.090" end="00:07:35.660" style="s2">certain conversations that mentioned I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.650" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">was like oh maybe I&#39;m I can have them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.660" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">be on the 1 to have them so I started</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:42.710" style="s2">having them and really it was the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:46.340" style="s2">I chose the word emerge as the title is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.710" end="00:07:48.710" style="s2">because I wanted a brand that was broad</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.340" end="00:07:49.970" style="s2">enough to include anything that I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.710" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">interested in mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.970" end="00:07:56.630" style="s2">cuz being a friend of mine become almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:58.310" style="s2">like victimized by his brand because he</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.630" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">used it to explore something that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.310" end="00:08:03.110" style="s2">really passionate about at the time but</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">then kind of fell out of love with and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.110" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">it was really difficult for him and so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:09.950" style="s2">basically used as an excuse to just talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:11.530" style="s2">to people about what I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.950" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">and just kept following that thread</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.530" end="00:08:15.830" style="s2">following that thread and yeah so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:18.110" style="s2">had lots of really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.830" end="00:08:19.610" style="s2">conversations around diversity of topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.110" end="00:08:22.430" style="s2">many of which I think you&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.610" end="00:08:24.290" style="s2">on your podcast as well and have found</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.430" end="00:08:25.760" style="s2">my way into this weird little subculture</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.290" end="00:08:29.060" style="s2">that yeah as you acknowledged like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.760" end="00:08:32.210" style="s2">both kind of find ourselves in as ya</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.060" end="00:08:36.020" style="s2">begin perform yeah yeah I can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.210" end="00:08:39.250" style="s2">relate to wanting to have a broad enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.020" end="00:08:43.130" style="s2">scope so that you can be free to follow</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.250" end="00:08:44.150" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant as it comes up what</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.130" end="00:08:48.020" style="s2">struck me then is you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.150" end="00:08:49.760" style="s2">actually is yes what&#39;s emerging is so</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.020" end="00:08:52.400" style="s2">interesting and that gives you the scope</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:55.520" style="s2">but a key thing that you often discuss</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.400" end="00:08:58.660" style="s2">is sort of what occurs before emergence</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.520" end="00:09:02.960" style="s2">often and that&#39;s sort of decomposition</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:07.780" style="s2">true and so it&#39;s got that it&#39;s got that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.960" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">part-2 it - how would you describe the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.780" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">environment or what sort of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">were you looking for that just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">occurring</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.330" end="00:09:23.100" style="s2">hmm yeah III I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.500" end="00:09:25.470" style="s2">could articulate it originally really it</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:27.330" style="s2">was following a felt sense some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.470" end="00:09:28.980" style="s2">desire some kind of like euros in</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.330" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">relationship to certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.980" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">conversation and as you say like when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.630" end="00:09:37.470" style="s2">described there were some college</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">students here for a retreat this last</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.470" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">weekend and I was asked in front of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:43.769" style="s2">like to describe what my podcast is</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.029" end="00:09:45.180" style="s2">about and I don&#39;t know where they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.769" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">from you know they&#39;re college students</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.180" end="00:09:48.990" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of ideal ideological</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:51.510" style="s2">commitments or whatever and I just said</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:53.640" style="s2">the podcast the kind of thesis of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.510" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">podcast is something like or inquiry of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.640" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">the podcast is something like the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:02.660" style="s2">is falling apart what are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:07.470" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s really kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.339" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">right that&#39;s sort of the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.470" end="00:10:11.790" style="s2">there is this disintegration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:14.850" style="s2">falling apart the senescence of so many</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.790" end="00:10:16.050" style="s2">of the aspects of the world that I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.850" end="00:10:18.269" style="s2">for a long time we&#39;ve taken for granted</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.050" end="00:10:20.370" style="s2">or I mean out a long time you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.269" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">cosmically but you know in recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.370" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">history and and that is both needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:27.060" style="s2">acknowledged right we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.770" style="s2">acknowledge that dissolution but also</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">see that you as you say it clears a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.770" end="00:10:35.270" style="s2">space for something new to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">kind of trying to sort of sniff out the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.270" end="00:10:41.850" style="s2">the pheromones of that emergence as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">occurring live on this planet right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.850" end="00:10:48.029" style="s2">yeah partly as a hope - it&#39;s just to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:54.570" style="s2">it but then also perhaps to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.029" end="00:10:56.250" style="s2">facilitate its unfolding right at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.570" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">to be in touch with it so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.250" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">orient in a way that is authentic and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:07.020" style="s2">for some in the direction of love right</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:10.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that&#39;s true - right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.020" end="00:11:11.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a little bit like I said</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.050" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">like I&#39;m following what&#39;s emerging you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:15.209" style="s2">know but also like what&#39;s emerging is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.140" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">like the alt-right and the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.209" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">authoritarian governments but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">really covering that I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.779" end="00:11:24.120" style="s2">focus on that I have some kind of moral</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:26.040" style="s2">commitment that colors and isolates</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.120" end="00:11:27.620" style="s2">constrains my inquiry as you say and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:29.780" style="s2">has to do with yet wanting to build</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.620" end="00:11:36.920" style="s2">future that we can actually be proud to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.780" end="00:11:41.180" style="s2">live in yeah yeah how what what are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.920" end="00:11:45.500" style="s2">key themes what are the elements of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.180" end="00:11:51.740" style="s2">conversation that either surprised you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.500" end="00:11:54.740" style="s2">that emerged or that were in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.740" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">sort of felt congruent with that initial</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.740" end="00:12:01.880" style="s2">felt sense of inquiry and have now</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:03.980" style="s2">become sort of really not concrete but</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.880" end="00:12:07.910" style="s2">you know close to concrete pillars of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.980" end="00:12:10.640" style="s2">how you describe the the pheromones as</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.910" end="00:12:14.180" style="s2">you said of what is substantial to use</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.640" end="00:12:17.840" style="s2">as a basis for inquiry yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.180" end="00:12:19.850" style="s2">I like the way you put that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.840" end="00:12:21.260" style="s2">nothing that I didn&#39;t feel was there at</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.850" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">the beginning but they&#39;ve all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.260" end="00:12:26.360" style="s2">filled out right and so there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:28.460" style="s2">like the centralized</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.360" end="00:12:29.720" style="s2">government&#39;s governance like whether</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.460" end="00:12:31.430" style="s2">it&#39;s distributed autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.720" end="00:12:34.790" style="s2">organizations or even things like in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.430" end="00:12:36.500" style="s2">spiral or holacracy and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.790" end="00:12:39.530" style="s2">emerging technology that might allow</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.500" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">those to scale their systems science</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.530" end="00:12:46.220" style="s2">complexity science and in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:49.370" style="s2">ability to kind of see things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.220" end="00:12:52.490" style="s2">of flows that move in different ways are</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.370" end="00:12:53.810" style="s2">constrained by different factors one</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.490" end="00:12:56.390" style="s2">thing that actually has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.810" end="00:12:59.630" style="s2">surprised me is for me that the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.390" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">around the importance of soul and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.630" end="00:13:05.060" style="s2">soulfulness and soul making that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:06.770" style="s2">really on my radar before that of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.060" end="00:13:09.020" style="s2">like the kind of relevance and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.770" end="00:13:11.870" style="s2">significance of personal development and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.020" end="00:13:14.600" style="s2">personal transformation in terms of how</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.870" end="00:13:17.810" style="s2">we can collectively meet the meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.600" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">and then you know different flavors of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.810" end="00:13:23.000" style="s2">the meaning crisis as John for Vicki</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">talks about it I&#39;ve kind of broached</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.000" end="00:13:28.340" style="s2">that in a number of different ways right</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">and then another theme is of course like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.340" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:40.140" style="s2">a letting go of the world that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:42.660" style="s2">grown up with and the stories and like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.140" end="00:13:46.110" style="s2">kind of narratives about what our lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.660" end="00:13:47.480" style="s2">ought to be that civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.110" end="00:13:50.220" style="s2">operating-system</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.480" end="00:13:53.780" style="s2">gave to us which has been for me very</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.220" end="00:13:56.070" style="s2">painful and like a long process yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.780" end="00:13:59.550" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m sure there are others that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.070" end="00:14:01.380" style="s2">just kind of like some hood my head I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.550" end="00:14:04.470" style="s2">mean we&#39;ve also explored meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.380" end="00:14:08.180" style="s2">and yeah like integral and all that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:11.870" style="s2">of weird stuff yeah it&#39;s interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.180" end="00:14:16.200" style="s2">different communities different memes</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.870" end="00:14:20.940" style="s2">hmm that are clustered around whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">that broad area of inquiry is that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.940" end="00:14:26.760" style="s2">just articulated if I was to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:29.400" style="s2">slightly other words and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.760" end="00:14:35.210" style="s2">leaving out crucial parts of it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.400" end="00:14:45.380" style="s2">something like how do we put together</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.210" end="00:14:45.380" style="s2">synthesize or or relate in a congruent</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.980" end="00:14:54.540" style="s2">fluid way the inner development and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:14:57.390" style="s2">expression of individuality in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.540" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">landscape of interconnection where we</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.390" end="00:15:08.360" style="s2">ourselves are complex agents having an</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">effect on a complex multi-layered world</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.360" end="00:15:15.380" style="s2">so ha and the meaning associated with</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:19.800" style="s2">what it is to express our authentic</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.380" end="00:15:27.030" style="s2">unfolding and evolution in that larger</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.800" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">dynamic that itself is changing and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.030" end="00:15:31.170" style="s2">there&#39;s something quite meta about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:34.020" style="s2">and so there is this meta element that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.170" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">think sort of ties together a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.020" end="00:15:38.580" style="s2">these different communities whether you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:41.490" style="s2">know the meta modernists which I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.580" end="00:15:43.370" style="s2">too familiar with although I do try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.490" end="00:15:47.090" style="s2">track it a bit or</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.370" end="00:15:49.250" style="s2">of course you have you know those</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.090" end="00:15:53.570" style="s2">awesome cofounders of the neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.250" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">collective just trailblazing what</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.570" end="00:15:57.320" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:59.830" style="s2">providing meta map after meta map and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.320" end="00:16:03.410" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson actually as well was</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.830" end="00:16:06.020" style="s2">he was you know his intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.410" end="00:16:08.180" style="s2">scaffolding was a meta theory of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">and of course the integral theorists the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.180" end="00:16:16.910" style="s2">same and so there is this sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">you know putting a sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.910" end="00:16:23.530" style="s2">find some fertile center ground as in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:28.670" style="s2">some sense not on the same plane but</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.530" end="00:16:31.390" style="s2">raised something that is able to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.670" end="00:16:35.330" style="s2">perspective that is perhaps beyond</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.390" end="00:16:39.700" style="s2">dichotomies that are tired and not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.330" end="00:16:41.810" style="s2">serving us and that move towards</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.700" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">transcending and including then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.810" end="00:16:47.270" style="s2">obviously with the with the famous</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">integral phrase is a sort of basic</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.270" end="00:16:53.870" style="s2">scaffolding for transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:55.970" style="s2">general so there is somewhere that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.870" end="00:16:58.760" style="s2">think would be interesting to for us to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.970" end="00:17:00.920" style="s2">try and explore together and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.760" end="00:17:03.530" style="s2">see if I can set the stage for it it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.920" end="00:17:10.700" style="s2">hope I can I hope I can express the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.530" end="00:17:14.600" style="s2">well enough so the idea I mean I might</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.700" end="00:17:20.920" style="s2">begin by saying like we&#39;re embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.600" end="00:17:27.130" style="s2">an interrelation of complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.920" end="00:17:30.140" style="s2">some change quicker than others you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.130" end="00:17:34.340" style="s2">obviously our cells have a shorter life</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.140" end="00:17:36.800" style="s2">span and neurons and we have we live for</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.340" end="00:17:38.660" style="s2">so long cities lasts for so long</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.800" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">generally speaking government</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.660" end="00:17:48.640" style="s2">civilizations the solar system species</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.539" end="00:17:59.799" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense in which what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.450" end="00:18:03.690" style="s2">meaningful is to engage in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.799" end="00:18:03.690" style="s2">kind of loving transformation towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.109" end="00:18:16.049" style="s2">some sort of how we say</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:18.970" style="s2">stability but also expression over time</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.049" end="00:18:21.519" style="s2">some sort of fulfillment some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.970" end="00:18:24.070" style="s2">hole-making of one&#39;s own individual self</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.519" end="00:18:27.519" style="s2">in relationship to others all the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.070" end="00:18:30.580" style="s2">while elements of yourself and the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.519" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">around you are moving at various cycles</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.580" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">towards decay and it&#39;s perhaps a a task</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:39.429" style="s2">especially in the world that we wake up</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:41.710" style="s2">to right now which is one where we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.429" end="00:18:44.529" style="s2">the capacity at least to some degree to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.710" end="00:18:46.809" style="s2">reflect and to engage in abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.529" end="00:18:48.399" style="s2">to watch this crazy dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.809" end="00:18:49.960" style="s2">witnessing and being with and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.399" end="00:18:52.749" style="s2">participating and then being</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.960" end="00:18:54.429" style="s2">disconnected so that we can in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.749" end="00:18:57.809" style="s2">sense take a perspective and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.429" end="00:18:57.809" style="s2">something really worth talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.169" end="00:19:06.639" style="s2">but the idea might be how do we so an</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.009" end="00:19:10.950" style="s2">interesting Avenue for exploration is at</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.639" end="00:19:13.539" style="s2">what level or which problems or which</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.950" end="00:19:16.379" style="s2">underlying systemic changes or which</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.539" end="00:19:18.970" style="s2">aspects of ourself are most in need of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.379" end="00:19:21.729" style="s2">tending and shepherding a certain</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.729" end="00:19:26.499" style="s2">rather than before their time some</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.879" end="00:19:29.499" style="s2">things might serve us still for longer</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.499" end="00:19:31.629" style="s2">there might be social aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.499" end="00:19:33.999" style="s2">society now that we might come to see in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.629" end="00:19:36.429" style="s2">a few hundred years time our you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.999" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">not not serving us then but right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.429" end="00:19:41.619" style="s2">perhaps we&#39;re unaware of them or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:44.499" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right place for someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.619" end="00:19:46.599" style="s2">focus we&#39;ve noticed obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.499" end="00:19:49.779" style="s2">development of a certain morality over</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.599" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">time and it seems inappropriate to look</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.779" end="00:19:54.460" style="s2">back at ancestors and just tar them all</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.619" style="s2">with a brush of being absolutely immoral</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.460" end="00:19:58.269" style="s2">there was a sense in which everyone was</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.619" end="00:19:59.859" style="s2">responding to the dynamics of the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.269" end="00:20:02.980" style="s2">and the incentives of the time with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.859" end="00:20:05.140" style="s2">capacity they had in that and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.980" end="00:20:09.070" style="s2">it becomes then crucial to consider just</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.140" end="00:20:12.580" style="s2">what of our nature is most in need of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.070" end="00:20:16.270" style="s2">change and where I see this question</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.580" end="00:20:18.190" style="s2">being relevant is when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.270" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">kind of conversation and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.190" end="00:20:23.710" style="s2">points that let&#39;s say Daniels Martin</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:25.870" style="s2">burger raises and that have become key</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.710" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">parts of the emerging conversation which</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.870" end="00:20:31.930" style="s2">is to do I suppose with rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:36.760" style="s2">dynamics and a certain win lose attitude</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.930" end="00:20:40.840" style="s2">towards how we show up in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.760" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">relationship with others and that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.840" end="00:20:46.360" style="s2">that is deep it&#39;s so deep and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">sure how deep I add I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.360" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">know how deep it might be so deep that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:54.820" style="s2">that is all there is I like it gets so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:57.370" style="s2">deep where I&#39;m like okay how at what</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.820" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">level is this picked apart where where</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.370" end="00:21:03.820" style="s2">do we go to find ourselves in that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:04.990" style="s2">and so you know I began by saying with</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.820" end="00:21:06.940" style="s2">this question I hope I composed it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.990" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">probably I don&#39;t have a full articulated</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.940" end="00:21:10.840" style="s2">question I&#39;ve tried to give a context of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">some things changing quickly and some</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.840" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">things changing slowly and to be a sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:18.070" style="s2">of as elegant as possible about changing</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:22.030" style="s2">things but we&#39;re at this point where</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.070" end="00:21:26.140" style="s2">things need to change in huge ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:28.060" style="s2">because consequences are so drastic so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.140" end="00:21:31.030" style="s2">wonder what comes up for you there in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.060" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">terms of perhaps where you found some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.030" end="00:21:36.030" style="s2">the most fundamental underlying the sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:40.900" style="s2">of the deep code the deep programs that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.030" end="00:21:45.700" style="s2">you feel are worthy to draw up into</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.900" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">articulation as those that we ought take</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.700" end="00:21:51.720" style="s2">seriously from a point of real</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:51.720" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.820" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a beautiful question</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.960" end="00:22:07.220" style="s2">I think I think over one of the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:10.820" style="s2">of what you said that was most striking</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.220" end="00:22:14.669" style="s2">was kind of this question of what if its</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.820" end="00:22:20.249" style="s2">rival risk dynamics all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.669" end="00:22:23.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really significant question</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.249" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">and a lot actually hinges on that on</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.159" end="00:22:29.519" style="s2">that question and I think we you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:34.200" style="s2">kind of put it put a bookmark in it but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.519" end="00:22:35.730" style="s2">just to say like the perspective of my</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.200" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">opinion but the buddha-dharma</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.730" end="00:22:41.340" style="s2">and certainly the teacher here at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:46.289" style="s2">monastery is that in fact there is we</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.340" end="00:22:49.109" style="s2">might say like an omni Wynne foundation</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.289" end="00:22:51.359" style="s2">to consciousness that is kind of waiting</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.109" end="00:22:54.269" style="s2">to be overturned underneath the rival</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.359" end="00:23:00.149" style="s2">risk at least that&#39;s how kind of I under</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.269" end="00:23:03.989" style="s2">stand it yeah and so that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.149" end="00:23:05.340" style="s2">eat least imagine that might be true for</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.989" end="00:23:08.190" style="s2">any of us to actually work out in long</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.340" end="00:23:10.409" style="s2">run in terms of like what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.190" end="00:23:13.379" style="s2">transformed I mean as you say it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.409" end="00:23:19.169" style="s2">hard to point to anything in particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.379" end="00:23:22.200" style="s2">and I think that is why like Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.169" end="00:23:24.749" style="s2">Daniel really emphasized this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.200" end="00:23:27.539" style="s2">for sovereignty and choice making right</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.749" end="00:23:30.330" style="s2">because if you try to learn or unlearn</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.539" end="00:23:32.070" style="s2">anything in particular it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.330" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">everything else because everything is</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.070" end="00:23:36.269" style="s2">connected and so you just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:37.409" style="s2">kind of what you&#39;re doing that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.269" end="00:23:39.210" style="s2">how we got in the mess were in right</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.409" end="00:23:41.369" style="s2">like we didn&#39;t know when we made cars to</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.210" end="00:23:42.899" style="s2">solve the the horseshit problem in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.369" end="00:23:45.359" style="s2">cities and go faster that it would lead</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.899" end="00:23:49.559" style="s2">to war in the Middle East and climate</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.359" end="00:23:53.909" style="s2">change and so like we also have to what</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.559" end="00:23:58.230" style="s2">we can do though is take a look at if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.909" end="00:24:03.629" style="s2">can find it that which when increased or</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.230" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">when work done like allows us to then</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.629" end="00:24:08.519" style="s2">respond skillfully in whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:11.159" style="s2">circumstances we find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.519" end="00:24:13.109" style="s2">knowing that we don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.159" end="00:24:15.269" style="s2">everything is changing so quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.109" end="00:24:19.169" style="s2">certainly for me like what I really try</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.269" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">to like focus on is increasing my</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.169" end="00:24:24.679" style="s2">sovereignty focusing on those capacities</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:24.679" style="s2">of choice making</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.920" end="00:24:30.950" style="s2">but yeah I don&#39;t really feel satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.380" end="00:24:33.570" style="s2">with that answer given given the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.950" end="00:24:36.800" style="s2">quality that I felt with your your</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.570" end="00:24:36.800" style="s2">question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.920" end="00:24:51.780" style="s2">what comes to mind for me is that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.380" end="00:24:55.590" style="s2">question I asked is perhaps not the sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.780" end="00:24:57.780" style="s2">of question that the feeling of so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.590" end="00:25:02.160" style="s2">total satisfaction in answering it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.780" end="00:25:04.760" style="s2">be appropriate right because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.160" end="00:25:08.090" style="s2">precisely the kind of question that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.760" end="00:25:08.090" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.900" end="00:25:16.500" style="s2">let&#39;s hope is capable of addressing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.890" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">an ongoing fashion it&#39;s so challenging</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.500" end="00:25:24.930" style="s2">because letting go of things is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.820" style="s2">difficult yeah well and that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.930" end="00:25:31.610" style="s2">thing that comes to mind is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.820" end="00:25:35.310" style="s2">gonna work work on one thing I would say</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.610" end="00:25:39.390" style="s2">come to terms with your own death mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.310" end="00:25:41.100" style="s2">except that you will die mm-hmm not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">will that prepare you to be of service</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.100" end="00:25:47.110" style="s2">but I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.950" end="00:25:50.019" style="s2">the degree that we can make that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.110" end="00:25:52.990" style="s2">movement of accepting our own death we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.019" end="00:25:54.820" style="s2">can actually engage with this situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.990" end="00:25:56.740" style="s2">we find ourselves and with our like</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.820" end="00:25:59.769" style="s2">whole soul and our whole heart online</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.740" end="00:26:01.990" style="s2">yeah like I was talking to Zach Stein I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.769" end="00:26:06.929" style="s2">was at I was recording an episode with</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.990" end="00:26:09.700" style="s2">him yesterday and he said that you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.929" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">one way to look at this is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.700" end="00:26:16.380" style="s2">put this soul as the as the basis as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:20.860" style="s2">primary thing and then in that case</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.380" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">there are we might imagine that it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.860" end="00:26:28.059" style="s2">be worse to lose your soul in the act of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:31.179" style="s2">saving the organic world then it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.059" end="00:26:33.250" style="s2">be to let it pass and save your soul and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.179" end="00:26:34.690" style="s2">and nourish your soul protector so</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.250" end="00:26:37.720" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s like a kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.690" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">extreme extreme position and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.720" end="00:26:42.039" style="s2">like actually that&#39;s just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:43.870" style="s2">emphasize a point right and so like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.039" end="00:26:46.600" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I feel a lot too</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.870" end="00:26:48.610" style="s2">is in this whole world this milieu it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.600" end="00:26:50.500" style="s2">like oh we gotta like organize to save</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.610" end="00:26:53.590" style="s2">the planet from collapse it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.500" end="00:26:55.630" style="s2">like how are you treating your loved</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.590" end="00:26:57.820" style="s2">ones right like what are your</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.630" end="00:27:00.580" style="s2">conversations and relationships like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.820" end="00:27:04.360" style="s2">like what was the what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.580" end="00:27:06.970" style="s2">health of your soul mmm how is it how is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.360" end="00:27:09.100" style="s2">it like as he said in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.970" end="00:27:12.970" style="s2">like that&#39;s the real game like game a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.100" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">game be like yes please we need that but</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.970" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">also like don&#39;t forget you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.830" end="00:27:29.170" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve found to be an</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:37.970" style="s2">expression one of the expressions of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.170" end="00:27:40.030" style="s2">bedrock place I found myself is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.970" end="00:27:45.890" style="s2">expression I will not violate my soul</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.030" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s non-negotiable yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.890" end="00:27:49.670" style="s2">detect that in being with you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:51.940" style="s2">actually a really like beautiful quality</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.670" end="00:27:51.940" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:04.700" style="s2">and the link I see between what that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.570" end="00:28:08.750" style="s2">expression means or at least part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.700" end="00:28:13.870" style="s2">what it means and conversation is but</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.750" end="00:28:13.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a straight link there up into</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.899" end="00:28:29.690" style="s2">the courage to step out and express what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.159" end="00:28:34.340" style="s2">seems resonant yes yeah and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.690" end="00:28:39.169" style="s2">to be one key piece of wisdom throughout</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.340" end="00:28:45.669" style="s2">the ages that underlies I think many of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.169" end="00:28:52.100" style="s2">the salient figures and speakers and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.669" end="00:28:57.230" style="s2">teachers of our time so and it&#39;s and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.100" end="00:29:04.450" style="s2">accords with this fundamental truth of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.230" end="00:29:09.019" style="s2">the unique quality and importance of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.450" end="00:29:11.149" style="s2">every individual voice expression it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.019" end="00:29:16.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be verbal of course but</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.149" end="00:29:20.090" style="s2">that there is a role that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.269" end="00:29:22.929" style="s2">that there is a line of melody that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.090" end="00:29:27.380" style="s2">there is a part of the dance to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.929" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">participate in and if that is brought</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.380" end="00:29:34.070" style="s2">forth it it it&#39;s change is all I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know what its changes but it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.070" end="00:29:45.519" style="s2">involved yes yeah yes so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:49.389" style="s2">something I want to track back to and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.519" end="00:29:54.139" style="s2">draw up here and it relates back to this</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.389" end="00:29:58.340" style="s2">interplay of rivalries dynamics and at</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.139" end="00:30:04.519" style="s2">what layer of the psyche a collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.340" end="00:30:06.649" style="s2">psyche perhaps biological substrate that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.519" end="00:30:08.550" style="s2">they&#39;re embedded in that it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.649" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.550" end="00:30:17.430" style="s2">and I you know it&#39;s funny on this side</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:20.010" style="s2">of the conversation where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.430" end="00:30:22.800" style="s2">experiencing myself for this moment as</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.010" end="00:30:25.650" style="s2">putting the question forward it seems in</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.800" end="00:30:29.580" style="s2">so doing I am carving the world in such</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.650" end="00:30:31.830" style="s2">a way that leaves that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.580" end="00:30:34.350" style="s2">somewhat oppositional that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.830" end="00:30:37.680" style="s2">tension here and it&#39;s kind of breaking</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.350" end="00:30:40.560" style="s2">things up so that then perhaps we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.680" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">move towards a witnessing or observing</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.560" end="00:30:47.250" style="s2">and then that process becomes a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.950" end="00:30:51.210" style="s2">that we can situate ourselves in as one</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.250" end="00:30:56.160" style="s2">and therefore that julna s&#39; that duality</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.210" end="00:30:59.220" style="s2">perhaps perhaps you know becomes as one</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.160" end="00:31:03.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting that question</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">question a dynamic and the reason I say</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.720" end="00:31:08.610" style="s2">it&#39;s because actually I&#39;m in some deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.540" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">sense that I can&#39;t express in the asking</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.610" end="00:31:18.510" style="s2">of the question I believe and know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:22.130" style="s2">at court due to the interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.510" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">nature of things that there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.130" end="00:31:33.050" style="s2">inherently a equal parts beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:37.140" style="s2">tragic but ultimately a dynamic that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.050" end="00:31:44.340" style="s2">transcendent of any sort of a final</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.140" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">win-lose formulation however situating</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.340" end="00:31:50.940" style="s2">ourselves in relationship with that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:53.940" style="s2">that that that nature that is there to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.940" end="00:31:59.910" style="s2">be with at times but I know for my part</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.940" end="00:32:03.540" style="s2">I fall out of all the time and then our</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.910" end="00:32:05.580" style="s2">actions in this plane at this time given</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.540" end="00:32:07.380" style="s2">the complexity of them given our immense</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.580" end="00:32:11.340" style="s2">power all of a sudden they&#39;re we&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.380" end="00:32:13.410" style="s2">open again to this vast complexity but</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.340" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">what I have to say and what I hope I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.410" end="00:32:21.350" style="s2">now now move myself along to to putting</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:21.350" style="s2">forward is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.429" end="00:32:31.179" style="s2">that the wind lose dynamic as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.880" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2">the Omni win if that&#39;s characterized and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.179" end="00:32:36.100" style="s2">so I suppose first you know tell me if</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:39.870" style="s2">this is a characterization you share if</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.100" end="00:32:43.259" style="s2">this omni wind dynamic is perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.870" end="00:32:50.590" style="s2">instead of sort of an omni growth</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.259" end="00:32:55.570" style="s2">dynamic then the idea of losing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.590" end="00:32:57.399" style="s2">perfectly acceptable insofar as that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.570" end="00:33:02.019" style="s2">affords growth and continued</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.399" end="00:33:08.500" style="s2">participation in a unifying feature that</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.019" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">is respected and loved as a cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.500" end="00:33:15.970" style="s2">that loving participation for example so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:19.480" style="s2">I&#39;m a I&#39;m a big football fan soccer for</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.970" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">for you guys I support Tottenham fucking</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.250" end="00:33:32.409" style="s2">right and and it&#39;s always there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.950" end="00:33:33.879" style="s2">that joke there and of course it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.409" end="00:33:36.580" style="s2">always that joke for some people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.879" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">then we can use that as a lens by which</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.580" end="00:33:41.769" style="s2">to understand you know some people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.710" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">difficulty in life fundamentally but</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.769" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:52.019" style="s2">still valuable about losing and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:55.570" style="s2">there&#39;s referees and it&#39;s like okay we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.019" end="00:33:57.460" style="s2">we agree that there can only be one</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.570" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">winner but in the striving for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.460" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">there is a beautiful journey created and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:10.149" style="s2">we shake hands at the end and in some</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:14.889" style="s2">sense there&#39;s a deeper there&#39;s a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.149" end="00:34:20.109" style="s2">nature to the game that is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.889" end="00:34:21.849" style="s2">beauty to it that is the true joy for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.109" end="00:34:25.270" style="s2">for me and I think is the true joy that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.849" end="00:34:27.639" style="s2">underlies it so I suppose I&#39;m asking you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.270" end="00:34:31.319" style="s2">how do you understand the Omni wind</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.639" end="00:34:31.319" style="s2">dynamic and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.090" end="00:34:38.210" style="s2">when is it appropriate to lose in some</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.860" end="00:34:40.920" style="s2">sense or how what kind of losses are</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.210" end="00:34:47.160" style="s2">important yeah I love that I love that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.920" end="00:34:50.360" style="s2">inquiry I mean so for me I think of Omni</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.160" end="00:34:53.490" style="s2">win is this kind of like infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.360" end="00:34:56.760" style="s2">attractor that we will almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.490" end="00:34:59.430" style="s2">like never realize right but it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.760" end="00:35:01.860" style="s2">insofar as it helps us engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.430" end="00:35:04.650" style="s2">world such that we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.860" end="00:35:07.050" style="s2">opportunities for transformation mmm and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.650" end="00:35:09.210" style="s2">also get a kind of felt sense of like ah</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.050" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">this is the world that we want to create</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.210" end="00:35:18.390" style="s2">together it&#39;s totally reasonable to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">that there could be like losing</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.390" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">it what looks like losing in the context</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:28.020" style="s2">of a grander winning a richer winning</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:29.850" style="s2">like that and that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.020" end="00:35:33.480" style="s2">to me and I think there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.850" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">was said in the new things called that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.480" end="00:35:37.860" style="s2">is it the Nordic ideology the second</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:39.900" style="s2">book and listening society trilogy where</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.860" end="00:35:41.220" style="s2">they say like really the one way another</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.900" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">way to understand is like we want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.220" end="00:35:47.310" style="s2">make the losing less bad right</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">and so people there might still be like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.310" end="00:35:54.150" style="s2">winners and losers like I you know seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">like reasonable at least for many many</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.150" end="00:35:59.430" style="s2">years into the future but like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:02.670" style="s2">losing would turn you into a social</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.430" end="00:36:05.340" style="s2">pariah where you&#39;re just put into</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.670" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">basically a hell realm on earth mmm due</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.340" end="00:36:10.770" style="s2">to circumstances of birth or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:14.250" style="s2">you know all the ways in which our</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.770" end="00:36:18.150" style="s2">current system basically casts you out</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.250" end="00:36:21.810" style="s2">exhales you from though like the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.150" end="00:36:24.330" style="s2">benefits of being human right there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.810" end="00:36:26.010" style="s2">there&#39;s something in that like we want</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.330" end="00:36:29.160" style="s2">to make the losing less bad but then</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.010" end="00:36:31.620" style="s2">yeah totally like I mean even like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.160" end="00:36:34.460" style="s2">know you I can imagine like a sports</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.620" end="00:36:37.350" style="s2">context like there&#39;s this this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.460" end="00:36:39.630" style="s2">something I want to climb and I try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.350" end="00:36:41.670" style="s2">climb and I lose over and over again and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.630" end="00:36:43.880" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the journey of winning</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.670" end="00:36:47.580" style="s2">right and so there is clearly like</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.880" end="00:36:49.890" style="s2">developmentally this sort of movement of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.580" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">challenge and failure and failure and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.890" end="00:36:54.210" style="s2">failure and then like rising to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:56.670" style="s2">occasion and like certainly like here at</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.210" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">the monastery which I often think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.670" end="00:37:02.610" style="s2">as a kind of like microcosm Omni win</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:05.160" style="s2">system right all of us are here for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.610" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">sake of our growth there&#39;s a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.160" end="00:37:09.810" style="s2">losing going on in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:12.600" style="s2">get you get told like you did that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.810" end="00:37:14.940" style="s2">you did not do that well enough you lost</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.600" end="00:37:17.820" style="s2">you you had a goal and you did not</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.940" end="00:37:19.260" style="s2">achieve it you know and you Lobby</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.820" end="00:37:21.840" style="s2">you know in a way that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.260" end="00:37:24.150" style="s2">losing but is in service of a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.840" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">wing and a context that we can all kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.150" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">of trust in believe in feel a part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:30.570" style="s2">mmm which I don&#39;t think can in any way</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.250" style="s2">shape or form be said about the losing</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.570" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.250" end="00:37:36.119" style="s2">in our in our operating system</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">collectively right now so yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.119" end="00:37:40.530" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what comes up for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:44.819" style="s2">ya know I think that all that all makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.530" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">a lot of sense when losing does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.819" end="00:37:52.890" style="s2">afford or is not consistent with growing</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">or but and participating in the growth</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.890" end="00:38:01.349" style="s2">and wholeness and whole making of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.940" end="00:38:03.329" style="s2">collective then it&#39;s to me that seems</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.349" end="00:38:07.079" style="s2">like a decent first crack at a</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.329" end="00:38:10.170" style="s2">definition of the badness of losing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.079" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">does not serve anyone and that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.170" end="00:38:18.359" style="s2">want to see yeah yeah yeah yeah and just</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.940" end="00:38:22.740" style="s2">to make it less vicious so vicious in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.359" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">the world today it&#39;s so vicious it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.740" end="00:38:30.990" style="s2">easy as well and look and I can only</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">speak to this from a from some blinkered</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.990" end="00:38:40.130" style="s2">perspective what I have witnessed in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.900" end="00:38:44.089" style="s2">own life is just how difficult it is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:51.690" style="s2">make productive movements towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.089" end="00:38:55.950" style="s2">betterment in any form when your key you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.690" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">know physiology is fucked when your</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.950" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">nervous system is not in a good state</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:08.030" style="s2">you know and these baseline conditions</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:12.270" style="s2">it&#39;s it it does seem to be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.030" end="00:39:15.720" style="s2">people forget or perhaps never have</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.270" end="00:39:19.829" style="s2">experience but then forget just what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.720" end="00:39:24.359" style="s2">is to be in a state of less capability</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.829" end="00:39:30.569" style="s2">and yeah yeah this was something perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.359" end="00:39:36.329" style="s2">I did not understand as well as I do now</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.569" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I was majorly blind about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.329" end="00:39:45.910" style="s2">it but you know we take a certain you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:51.609" style="s2">know we have like a a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.910" end="00:39:53.559" style="s2">Viable Product as a as a big organ and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.609" end="00:39:55.539" style="s2">if some of those conditions aren&#39;t met</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.559" end="00:39:57.490" style="s2">then it&#39;s very very difficult to move</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.539" end="00:40:01.240" style="s2">the needle in other places and really</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.490" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">yeah this is an example of the yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.240" end="00:40:08.650" style="s2">III think we agree so wholeheartedly I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:12.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s you know I&#39;ve been in states</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.650" end="00:40:14.559" style="s2">of crippling like near suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.250" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">depression before right which has given</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.559" end="00:40:19.869" style="s2">me a kind of I think a sense of what it</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:22.750" style="s2">can be like to just have we might say</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.869" end="00:40:27.089" style="s2">like a very reduced sovereignty right</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.750" end="00:40:29.319" style="s2">like very little freedom very little</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.089" end="00:40:33.720" style="s2">capacity to meet the world as it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.319" end="00:40:37.210" style="s2">right it&#39;s like at least in America like</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.720" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">maybe most people maybe more than most</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.210" end="00:40:43.420" style="s2">people are like locked in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:45.670" style="s2">stress response that is compromising</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.420" end="00:40:48.220" style="s2">their capacity as an organism to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.670" end="00:40:51.720" style="s2">actually do like coherent sense making</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.220" end="00:40:55.299" style="s2">to really like make good choices like</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.720" end="00:40:58.569" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s the state of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.299" end="00:41:00.279" style="s2">our world like in which losing puts you</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.569" end="00:41:02.529" style="s2">in a position where you&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.279" end="00:41:05.230" style="s2">negative feedback loops and make you</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.529" end="00:41:07.809" style="s2">harder and harder and harder it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.230" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">downward spiral of poverty and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.809" end="00:41:11.559" style="s2">here in America it&#39;s a very real</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:13.180" style="s2">phenomenon and it&#39;s it&#39;s terrifying so</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.559" end="00:41:15.369" style="s2">what it means to like not lose so bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.180" end="00:41:17.740" style="s2">with me but somehow we we break that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.369" end="00:41:19.089" style="s2">spiral we create a floor that people</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.740" end="00:41:22.900" style="s2">can&#39;t lose past</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.089" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">that&#39;s just like like if when I say it</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.900" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">it feels so obvious but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">clearly hasn&#39;t been done and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.440" end="00:41:31.539" style="s2">radical in a way you know sure sure and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:36.130" style="s2">well and of course we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.539" end="00:41:38.589" style="s2">incentives that people you know are in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.130" end="00:41:43.420" style="s2">an environment with that might affect</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.589" end="00:41:47.260" style="s2">them to recognize this less and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.420" end="00:41:50.049" style="s2">also a capacity of awareness to attend</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.260" end="00:41:51.960" style="s2">to what about your structure the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.049" end="00:41:55.529" style="s2">different elements of it are or are not</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.529" end="00:41:59.620" style="s2">able to act with more sovereignty so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.119" end="00:42:02.500" style="s2">suppose it takes so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.620" end="00:42:04.330" style="s2">20 to recognize a lack of it as well so</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.500" end="00:42:06.730" style="s2">that we have always these both sides and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.330" end="00:42:08.410" style="s2">there was something that came up when</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.730" end="00:42:12.910" style="s2">you were speaking speaking now which</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:16.450" style="s2">ties in with some of them means I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.910" end="00:42:18.520" style="s2">John Bevere key amongst others is most</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.450" end="00:42:20.680" style="s2">like a the right figure to point to in</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.520" end="00:42:22.660" style="s2">this emerging conversation things he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.680" end="00:42:24.490" style="s2">introduced and a lot of the terms he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.660" end="00:42:26.260" style="s2">introduced of course are from other</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.490" end="00:42:28.900" style="s2">researchers and he&#39;s kind of collating</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.260" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">them and and so in my apologies for not</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.900" end="00:42:32.350" style="s2">being educated enough to speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:35.860" style="s2">appropriate you know people who have</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.350" end="00:42:37.570" style="s2">introduced these terms but but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.860" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">mentioned negative feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.570" end="00:42:43.000" style="s2">this is a key thing to realize that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:46.200" style="s2">can get stuck in and this is you know a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.000" end="00:42:49.210" style="s2">good first approximation of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.200" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">John refers to it as a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.210" end="00:42:55.390" style="s2">narrowing of the capacity to attend I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">love that framing yeah yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.390" end="00:42:59.650" style="s2">really nice whereas self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.330" style="s2">being a reciprocal opening so as this</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.650" end="00:43:02.950" style="s2">sense and it is you know the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.330" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">sovereignty is of course playing a role</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.950" end="00:43:08.910" style="s2">in there is this capacity again to look</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:13.480" style="s2">out observe sense make act observe again</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.910" end="00:43:17.460" style="s2">discern of course so if we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.480" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">then at what is some kind of unifying</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.460" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">feature of society the collective which</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:33.700" style="s2">enables losing good losing to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">then I mean it just struck me that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.700" end="00:43:40.860" style="s2">that in itself a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:45.490" style="s2">characterization of that unifying</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.860" end="00:43:47.800" style="s2">feature needs itself to be open to its</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:50.890" style="s2">own reciprocal opening its own</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.800" end="00:43:55.510" style="s2">transcendence so what in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.890" end="00:43:58.660" style="s2">participate in itself is itself open to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.510" end="00:44:02.110" style="s2">the same kind of transformation which</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.660" end="00:44:03.610" style="s2">all of a sudden then but to to and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.110" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">concept is something I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.610" end="00:44:08.020" style="s2">about for a long time and it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">easy concept I think to grasp although</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.020" end="00:44:12.490" style="s2">I&#39;m really terrible at telling what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:13.360" style="s2">easy or not easy to grasp I&#39;m hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.490" end="00:44:15.100" style="s2">actually I&#39;m hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.360" end="00:44:16.990" style="s2">that and that&#39;s a major arrow of mine</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.100" end="00:44:18.220" style="s2">it&#39;s almost selfish it&#39;s like once I</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.990" end="00:44:19.870" style="s2">understand something I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.220" end="00:44:22.030" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how I understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.870" end="00:44:24.040" style="s2">then I forget how I didn&#39;t notice how I</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.030" end="00:44:25.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand it before that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.040" end="00:44:27.340" style="s2">actually a particular kind of bias I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.750" end="00:44:28.750" style="s2">think it&#39;s like called the experts bias</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.340" end="00:44:30.760" style="s2">or something like that it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.750" end="00:44:31.870" style="s2">right I&#39;m in a fallacy I only learned</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.760" end="00:44:34.690" style="s2">about it recently it&#39;s fast because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.870" end="00:44:36.460" style="s2">have that same right I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.690" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">know how to address that apart from in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.460" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">dialogue with someone in dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.500" style="s2">someone then and you can attend where to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:46.330" style="s2">what self yeah yeah and as far as</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.500" end="00:44:49.510" style="s2">disseminating a message without being in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.330" end="00:44:56.970" style="s2">touch with people yeah clearly I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.510" end="00:45:00.340" style="s2">not a good grasp on this so yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.970" end="00:45:03.000" style="s2">feel that what also one thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.340" end="00:45:05.950" style="s2">say is I I feel very strongly like</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.000" end="00:45:07.840" style="s2">philosophically totally aligned and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.950" end="00:45:09.640" style="s2">resonant with what I hear you expressing</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.840" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">right in the bike and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.640" end="00:45:16.559" style="s2">beautiful book called Network ologies</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:18.210" style="s2">which is a philosophy of networks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.559" end="00:45:20.089" style="s2">not like Network science it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.210" end="00:45:23.130" style="s2">more like kind of like deluzy and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.089" end="00:45:27.029" style="s2">philosophy applied to networks and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.130" end="00:45:31.799" style="s2">it posits as the very central function</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.029" end="00:45:33.180" style="s2">of the kind of mmm networks there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.799" end="00:45:35.700" style="s2">to put it licit like the networks that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.180" end="00:45:38.970" style="s2">are going to save the world right create</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:42.049" style="s2">a context of robust emergence right</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.970" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">robust emergence means emergence the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.049" end="00:45:49.170" style="s2">emergence that we trust to go on and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">continue right and just as such a simple</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.170" end="00:45:52.769" style="s2">frame right but what we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:55.289" style="s2">in our in our culture in our world is</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.769" end="00:45:57.240" style="s2">emergence that is not robust that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.289" end="00:45:59.460" style="s2">actually going to decline and as in</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.240" end="00:46:01.500" style="s2">senescence and so what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.460" end="00:46:03.960" style="s2">create robust emerges emergence that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.500" end="00:46:06.569" style="s2">actually begets itself in an auto poetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.960" end="00:46:08.549" style="s2">way over and over again creating new</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.569" end="00:46:10.589" style="s2">novelty new opportunities for growth new</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.549" end="00:46:12.119" style="s2">understandings of what growth even is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.589" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">because we probably don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.119" end="00:46:17.099" style="s2">it is human beings have not found the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">farthest reaches of what a human being</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.099" end="00:46:21.329" style="s2">can be you know look at what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.279" style="s2">overcome if we&#39;re educated in most of</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.329" end="00:46:24.900" style="s2">the you know public education system if</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.279" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">they&#39;re like first uninstall that before</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.900" end="00:46:29.519" style="s2">we can even get to baseline like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:32.309" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like yeah I think I really</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.519" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">vibe with that sort of flavor and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.309" end="00:46:37.400" style="s2">aesthetic of like what we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:40.980" style="s2">going for is that like endless like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.400" end="00:46:44.099" style="s2">creation newness like emergence pouring</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.980" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">forth of the human soul back into itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.099" end="00:46:47.819" style="s2">in order to reflect back out into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:49.650" style="s2">world and this kind of like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.819" end="00:46:51.450" style="s2">infinite process of soul making</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.650" end="00:46:53.640" style="s2">collective soul making that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.450" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">points to for me and yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.640" end="00:47:03.450" style="s2">something I love about that it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:09.569" style="s2">see it&#39;s hard to see another all right</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.450" end="00:47:13.259" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to all right I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.569" end="00:47:15.000" style="s2">hard to be motivated by anything else I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.259" end="00:47:17.670" style="s2">would add another piece to it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.000" end="00:47:19.819" style="s2">which is that if we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.670" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">they&#39;re unfolding and evolving and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.819" end="00:47:25.349" style="s2">you know continual making as a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.810" style="s2">kind of growth and there&#39;s a soil</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.349" end="00:47:29.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a ground in which that growth is</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.810" end="00:47:31.950" style="s2">embedded and is nourished from and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.550" end="00:47:33.660" style="s2">gets back to this idea of something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.950" end="00:47:35.880" style="s2">changing slowly and something&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.660" end="00:47:39.540" style="s2">quickly so it&#39;s the mechanisms we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.880" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">in fact to analyze well though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.540" end="00:47:42.990" style="s2">just analysis that&#39;s doing it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:45.330" style="s2">still this capacity just to discern in</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.990" end="00:47:48.510" style="s2">this other way that&#39;s oriented by this</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.330" end="00:47:51.810" style="s2">feeling tone or we want to say it but</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.510" end="00:47:53.940" style="s2">it&#39;s what it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s really what a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.810" end="00:47:56.730" style="s2">what what are the plate tectonics that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.940" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">are supporting us now and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.730" end="00:48:01.370" style="s2">what are the dead roots that need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:04.920" style="s2">change always that recursive</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.370" end="00:48:07.740" style="s2">self-reflective criticality and so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.920" end="00:48:10.260" style="s2">are across the we are across the past</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.740" end="00:48:13.800" style="s2">and the future right like we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.260" end="00:48:16.200" style="s2">attendant to what is relevant in all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.800" end="00:48:18.600" style="s2">it somehow so it&#39;s obviously not just an</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.200" end="00:48:20.760" style="s2">expansion out without attachment and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:25.230" style="s2">love for its roots and it&#39;s what in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.760" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">roots is like what are we when we take</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.230" end="00:48:35.580" style="s2">away or when we act from I what what</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:38.070" style="s2">we&#39;d reduce humanity down to like before</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.580" end="00:48:40.440" style="s2">like what is there in our nature like oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.070" end="00:48:41.940" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m losing it here but it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.440" end="00:48:43.170" style="s2">dynamic between connection and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.940" end="00:48:46.860" style="s2">disconnection like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.170" end="00:48:50.250" style="s2">disconnected from and what do we find</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.860" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">when we connect back to that and how</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.250" end="00:48:57.990" style="s2">ubiquitous is that source of connection</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:49:00.210" style="s2">or at what point yeah well what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.990" end="00:49:05.640" style="s2">coming up for me as I hear you speak is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:09.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of sense of you know this</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.640" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">this kind of oscillatory or both and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.120" end="00:49:14.910" style="s2">nature of going back and retrieving and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.510" end="00:49:17.120" style="s2">in some cases protecting that which has</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.910" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">brought us to this point well also</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.120" end="00:49:23.030" style="s2">forward-looking kind of preparing to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">move into totally different unknown</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.030" end="00:49:30.210" style="s2">futures and that like there&#39;s I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:33.150" style="s2">appreciate the that like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.210" end="00:49:35.610" style="s2">proposed icons of the meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.150" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">movement is Janice the two-faced God</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.610" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">right who&#39;s looking back into the past</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:44.440" style="s2">and also forward into the future</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:46.490" style="s2">and kind of being there in the present</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.440" end="00:49:48.650" style="s2">acknowledging the value in both</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.490" end="00:49:50.870" style="s2">directions and not like leaning too far</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.650" end="00:49:53.570" style="s2">forward or too far back and yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.870" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">kind of finding that that that Center</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.570" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">we&#39;re not and I think that the my own</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">tendency and III yeah I suspect the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.660" style="s2">tendency of this kind of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">subculture is going to be leaning too</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.660" end="00:50:11.360" style="s2">far into the future leaning too far</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">forward not doing the work it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.360" end="00:50:16.340" style="s2">fully understand what you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:18.110" style="s2">deconstructing and letting go of because</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.340" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">it takes a lot of work like in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.110" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">context of the Buddhist tradition you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:25.670" style="s2">know that I&#39;m participating in here like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:28.810" style="s2">the amount of thinking and beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.670" end="00:50:31.940" style="s2">sophisticated elegant like just</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.810" end="00:50:34.460" style="s2">mind-blowing thoughtfulness that went</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.940" end="00:50:36.860" style="s2">into the construction of this tradition</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.460" end="00:50:39.080" style="s2">that we then like Westerners think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.860" end="00:50:40.550" style="s2">can come in and be like ah like I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.080" end="00:50:42.680" style="s2">a hundred page book and like this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.550" end="00:50:44.780" style="s2">what Buddhism is about you know no need</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.680" end="00:50:46.790" style="s2">for all of that that we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.780" end="00:50:48.860" style="s2">needed like I got it you know it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.790" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">the kind of like audacity of that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.860" end="00:50:54.740" style="s2">the arrogance of that is really striking</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:57.140" style="s2">and and I think that there are III</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.740" end="00:50:59.150" style="s2">imagine because Buddhism is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.140" end="00:51:02.270" style="s2">system that I&#39;m sort of closest with</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.150" end="00:51:05.360" style="s2">that that&#39;s probably true for many many</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.270" end="00:51:09.110" style="s2">many different systems arenas domains</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.360" end="00:51:10.790" style="s2">disciplines that we are considering</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.110" end="00:51:13.070" style="s2">moving beyond or considering</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.790" end="00:51:16.250" style="s2">transcending and including without</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.070" end="00:51:18.830" style="s2">actually doing the work of knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.250" end="00:51:20.510" style="s2">it means to include that thing it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.830" end="00:51:23.150" style="s2">easy for transcending and including to</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.510" end="00:51:25.550" style="s2">become a kind of way of bypassing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.150" end="00:51:28.280" style="s2">ignoring something without actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.550" end="00:51:29.570" style="s2">getting access to the understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.280" end="00:51:32.060" style="s2">wisdom that is pointing to you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.570" end="00:51:33.770" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.060" end="00:51:37.090" style="s2">interesting I keep looking across just</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.770" end="00:51:41.690" style="s2">to check the time but know that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.090" end="00:51:46.120" style="s2">what struck me is the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.690" end="00:51:49.370" style="s2">dialogue and the importance of immediate</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.120" end="00:51:51.080" style="s2">participatory feedback with others in an</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.370" end="00:51:53.300" style="s2">attempt to make sense of things right</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.080" end="00:51:55.550" style="s2">there&#39;s something about writing that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.300" end="00:51:57.620" style="s2">a beautiful exercise I love it</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.550" end="00:52:01.970" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely important to me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.620" end="00:52:05.000" style="s2">published nothing hmm and I&#39;ve written a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.970" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">lot I&#39;ve published nothing I write to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.000" end="00:52:09.980" style="s2">myself I try to understand things and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:12.050" style="s2">develop my understanding and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.980" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">constantly faced with the inadequacy of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.050" end="00:52:16.850" style="s2">what I see in front of me to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:19.850" style="s2">to where I feel actually most resonant</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.850" end="00:52:21.650" style="s2">to then explore and question and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.850" end="00:52:23.870" style="s2">trying to make a more general point here</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.650" end="00:52:27.470" style="s2">exactly other than I mean this is my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.870" end="00:52:30.920" style="s2">experience but there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.470" end="00:52:33.320" style="s2">is something about there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.920" end="00:52:35.120" style="s2">there&#39;s something attractive about you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.320" end="00:52:36.680" style="s2">know writing a book and exploring things</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.120" end="00:52:40.220" style="s2">through and taking people on a journey</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.680" end="00:52:45.050" style="s2">and having that stuff all down there but</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.220" end="00:52:48.560" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not a life is not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.050" end="00:52:50.120" style="s2">closed book mmm some things we can you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.560" end="00:52:51.650" style="s2">know look at and go okay you know this</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.120" end="00:52:53.660" style="s2">is wrong but then there&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.650" end="00:52:56.600" style="s2">participating in that understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.660" end="00:53:01.670" style="s2">what that was and it&#39;s something hi this</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.600" end="00:53:03.320" style="s2">I&#39;m so much more it feels more that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.670" end="00:53:05.210" style="s2">interaction that&#39;s what I&#39;m so I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.320" end="00:53:07.460" style="s2">grateful for all the different people</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.210" end="00:53:10.340" style="s2">doing this out here in particular people</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.460" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">like John vivace who engaged so much</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.340" end="00:53:15.590" style="s2">with so many people and this is someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:18.440" style="s2">who has done has done the work to write</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.590" end="00:53:20.900" style="s2">many books he has of course written a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.440" end="00:53:24.620" style="s2">bunch of things there&#39;s something he</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.900" end="00:53:26.210" style="s2">still clearly so values and realizes as</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.620" end="00:53:28.850" style="s2">important as a key part of his message</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.210" end="00:53:32.060" style="s2">to involve yourself in the participation</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.850" end="00:53:35.980" style="s2">of of understanding yeah I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.060" end="00:53:39.080" style="s2">really strongly and you know as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.980" end="00:53:42.920" style="s2">become more associated with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.080" end="00:53:45.140" style="s2">kind of meta space in general whether</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.920" end="00:53:47.150" style="s2">it&#39;s meta modernism or integral and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.140" end="00:53:49.250" style="s2">know now now folks reach out to me that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.150" end="00:53:52.460" style="s2">are just doing some kind of weird crazy</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.250" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">meta thing not to irregularly and they</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.460" end="00:53:58.670" style="s2">want me to look at their really abstract</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:54:00.320" style="s2">theory about systems and systems of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.670" end="00:54:02.570" style="s2">systems and how they all intersect and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.320" end="00:54:04.130" style="s2">make sense of the other systems and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.570" end="00:54:08.779" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.130" end="00:54:13.099" style="s2">for me so much of that is useful insofar</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.779" end="00:54:17.619" style="s2">as it points you back to your life right</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.099" end="00:54:17.619" style="s2">like so much of that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.969" end="00:54:24.349" style="s2">masturbatory feels that way to me not</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.430" end="00:54:26.119" style="s2">not all of it of course I love it I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.349" end="00:54:34.430" style="s2">engage in it yeah I&#39;m great</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.119" end="00:54:38.180" style="s2">me too but huh man like I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.430" end="00:54:40.969" style="s2">think it&#39;s an example of the lack it can</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.180" end="00:54:43.009" style="s2">be so difficult to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.969" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">conversation about some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.009" end="00:54:48.469" style="s2">and perhaps something we share is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:51.229" style="s2">we both started a podcast in part I</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.469" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">think to have conversations it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.229" end="00:54:55.759" style="s2">alright in it right yeah but yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:58.309" style="s2">think like as you say there&#39;s this word</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.759" end="00:55:01.279" style="s2">this idea of participation for me like</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.309" end="00:55:06.979" style="s2">it kind of cuts through all of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.279" end="00:55:11.029" style="s2">abstractions mm-hmm so for in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.979" end="00:55:13.729" style="s2">think it is the central call and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.029" end="00:55:16.699" style="s2">invitation of all of these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.729" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">at least that I&#39;ve been having is to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.699" end="00:55:24.799" style="s2">like look you are alive this is your</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:27.619" style="s2">chance what you do matters participate</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.799" end="00:55:30.499" style="s2">participate in your life participate in</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.619" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">the world like that is it because</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.499" end="00:55:36.680" style="s2">there&#39;s so many there&#39;s so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:41.230" style="s2">system that is hell-bent on making us</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.680" end="00:55:43.420" style="s2">forget that we are participants</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.230" end="00:55:44.800" style="s2">to think that we&#39;re consumers or voters</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.420" end="00:55:47.440" style="s2">something else we are not anticipating</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.800" end="00:55:49.150" style="s2">here on this world and we can make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.440" end="00:55:51.520" style="s2">sacred world or we can live in a flat</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.150" end="00:55:53.410" style="s2">world or we can live in the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:55.830" style="s2">world we get to participate in that in</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.410" end="00:55:55.830" style="s2">any case</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.200" end="00:56:02.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s so essential I think John for</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.970" end="00:56:03.960" style="s2">Vicki nails it in that yes that is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.490" end="00:56:08.190" style="s2">that&#39;s the core of the core of the core</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.960" end="00:56:10.230" style="s2">of the core yes yes yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.190" end="00:56:12.780" style="s2">beautiful Daniel yeah I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.230" end="00:56:16.290" style="s2">appreciate your expression of that mmm I</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.780" end="00:56:19.410" style="s2">recall and I can&#39;t say this is a direct</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.290" end="00:56:20.910" style="s2">quote just because my mind is not good</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.410" end="00:56:23.940" style="s2">at remembering direct quotes but</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.940" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">the participation in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.740" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">self-transcending transformation of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:35.880" style="s2">question and to do this and to</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:37.500" style="s2">participation to participate of course</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.880" end="00:56:44.510" style="s2">invokes the notion of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.500" end="00:56:47.069" style="s2">invokes this notion of being in a</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.069" end="00:56:55.380" style="s2">everyone is valued and it&#39;s transforming</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:57:00.589" style="s2">transforming what&#39;s relevant in</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.380" end="00:57:06.089" style="s2">community where the individual is valued</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.589" end="00:57:08.329" style="s2">that is the that is this is what we have</p>

<p begin="00:57:09.380" end="00:57:16.190" style="s2">what I want to well that she that that</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.190" end="00:57:20.449" style="s2">to the end here but what I want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:22.699" style="s2">you just in closing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.449" end="00:57:26.029" style="s2">something I you know depending on how</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.699" end="00:57:28.729" style="s2">the answer is something I could clip and</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.029" end="00:57:30.709" style="s2">maybe put at the beginning just because</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.729" end="00:57:32.449" style="s2">I want to offer you the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.709" end="00:57:34.249" style="s2">direct people to maybe particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.449" end="00:57:35.719" style="s2">episodes that you&#39;ve published that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.249" end="00:57:37.699" style="s2">think are really interesting for people</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.719" end="00:57:40.849" style="s2">to engage with I&#39;m conscious that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.699" end="00:57:44.719" style="s2">conversations I have are often assuming</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.849" end="00:57:46.339" style="s2">quite a bit of understanding and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.719" end="00:57:48.829" style="s2">can make it I think difficult for people</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.339" end="00:57:50.900" style="s2">who aren&#39;t you know exposed to any of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.829" end="00:57:53.900" style="s2">this stuff to necessarily be involved</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.900" end="00:57:55.729" style="s2">and I find that some of the podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.900" end="00:57:56.779" style="s2">you&#39;ve released have got some really for</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.729" end="00:57:58.699" style="s2">example and I&#39;m just gonna say at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.779" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">Daniels Martin burger one I think this I</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.699" end="00:58:03.559" style="s2">recommended this to loads of people is</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:05.660" style="s2">just an excellent example of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.559" end="00:58:08.900" style="s2">the some of the bedrock some of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.660" end="00:58:11.420" style="s2">important bedrock articulations of his</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.900" end="00:58:14.299" style="s2">understanding of things that inform that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.420" end="00:58:15.739" style="s2">speak to what is emerging as resonant to</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.299" end="00:58:18.979" style="s2">discuss so what would you direct people</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.739" end="00:58:23.869" style="s2">to in specifically your own in your own</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.979" end="00:58:25.999" style="s2">culture sure so I would say I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.869" end="00:58:27.769" style="s2">listen to the episode I did with Ronan</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.999" end="00:58:29.539" style="s2">Harrington I think that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.769" end="00:58:32.180" style="s2">introduction to what we might call like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.539" end="00:58:34.039" style="s2">the Nordic brand of meta modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.180" end="00:58:35.989" style="s2">then yeah direct people to the Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.039" end="00:58:39.140" style="s2">&#39;shmock Tim burger which would be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.989" end="00:58:44.390" style="s2">perhaps California flavor of meta</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.140" end="00:58:46.369" style="s2">modernism and then honestly like because</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.390" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">there&#39;s this other thing that we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.009" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">conversations really speak to but a</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.779" end="00:58:55.699" style="s2">conversation like with bear and silver</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:58.099" style="s2">which was earlier on and my catalog I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.699" end="00:58:59.930" style="s2">think would give that flavor and is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.099" end="00:59:03.079" style="s2">beautiful beautiful one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.930" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">conversations really beautiful and so</p>
