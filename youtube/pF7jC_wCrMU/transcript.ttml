<p begin="00:00:01.599" end="00:00:06.080" style="s2">all right this is a bit of an idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.919" end="00:00:08.080" style="s2">or maybe not i just use that graphic</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:09.679" style="s2">where there&#39;s a continuation from last</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.080" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">week where we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.679" end="00:00:13.759" style="s2">having a project that actually pays the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">bills both for our projects it can fund</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.759" end="00:00:16.880" style="s2">new projects and actually gives</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.320" style="s2">us a living wage or whoever&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">it a living wage um</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">and i did reach out to raymond and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.480" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t really respond so i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:27.199" style="s2">whether it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:29.199" style="s2">stuff going on or or what&#39;s up with that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.199" end="00:00:32.320" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.199" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">he&#39;s not here so we&#39;re on our own for</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.320" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">that at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">but i&#39;m sure we can figure out maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">do it like an idea cafe we can each take</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">a turn to share and offer</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:44.719" style="s2">ideas and what we think would be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:47.920" style="s2">most income generating</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.719" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">easiest solution we have yet to fly talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.920" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">about or have already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">yeah i guess i haven&#39;t thought that much</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">about income</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.520" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">raising i mean i know we talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s always for me it&#39;s always still</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:08.720" style="s2">kind of incidental</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">um for doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.720" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">doing what i want to do and then still</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">how can we</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">make it sustainable but</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">you know angels had some ideas on things</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">that are specifically profitable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve gotten a lot of interest on the um</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">rating system um still i guess i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">who would want to pay for it but uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:37.119" style="s2">so maybe that doesn&#39;t apply but every</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:38.720" style="s2">time i talk to someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh yeah i could use that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.720" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">for x</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">so i guess i don&#39;t have that much except</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">find a sustainable way to work on these</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:57.040" style="s2">projects full time</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">like the stepping forward stepping</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.040" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">backwards we all muted and bentley was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">off mute so he had to share first</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">a little bit of chicken um how to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:08.080" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m kind of obsessed with not</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">making money like the anti-money person</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.080" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">i&#39;m like you want to pay me for that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna make it less fun</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">but i also really want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">ourselves and other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">coming into this space and i definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">want to be able to support the projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;m focused on creating things from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">ground up so everyone can put in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">little bit of money and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">powerful amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">um income generating ones to me are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">ones that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">sell on the site right so like the labor</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">where a tiny percentage is going to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">pool something that does</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">solve a problem and hopefully in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">cooperative way that is game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">because then even if there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">saturated marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">oh i can&#39;t think of where it is the like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">niche of the market is like we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">it better because you can be involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">and you can see it and it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">and i think most people but still game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">right still marketed still beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">still functional still working</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">so that it&#39;s still going out to people</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">right if we created our own taskrabbit</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">or whatever then</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">having making sure that people know this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">one exists so that they can come to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">one and what makes us different</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">we&#39;re working together to make sure our</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">workers get paid and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">you have you know that we can coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">it so you were paying the least amount</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">as the payer</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">and you know rating systems and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">everything that makes sense um</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">and then i can&#39;t i mean there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">ones like that at one point i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">make an</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">i like global online credit union</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">because like a financial industry</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">thing that was that&#39;s way too big though</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">like i mean i can&#39;t even figure out to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">get 10 000 people including a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">thousand dollar project</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">and a credit you&#39;ll be like a million</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">dollar project but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">of money in financial endeavors and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">doing them in a game</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">a game b way possibly doing something</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">micro loan or a loan something that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">a pool of money and we all decide where</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">it goes to find the next project</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">but again we need a large number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">people or we all need to already be rich</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">win the lottery that&#39;s my last</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">all right uh yeah i kind of waited</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">because i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve obviously got opinions on this um</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">so i think the it sounds like the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">thing that this is about is where do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">start because there&#39;s a bunch of options</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">and i&#39;ve even got ideas you know that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">think could still be good</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">but they require kind of a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">significant time and resource</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">investment um that would be easier if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">already had something making money</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">um you know so it&#39;s the whole like it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">takes money to make money thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">um so i mean to me i think the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">starting point is still</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">a salesforce app just because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">from scratch project and you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:53.540" style="s2">built-in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.720" style="s2">you know possible customer base um</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.540" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.720" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">open two other ideas as well but to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">that sort of seems like the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">next step um i&#39;m not sure how much we</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">want to talk about just the individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">things that could make money</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">one of the questions i have is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">if you know tomorrow we could snap our</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">fingers and have a project making some</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">part of the question then becomes how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">we spend it like what part of it goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">towards staff costs</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">and then you know if let&#39;s say okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve got two or three people employed</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">but then we&#39;ve got some money left over</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">and you know what does reason score get</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">what does</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">election get how do we bring on new</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">projects and decide what they get</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">sort of how does that work and i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">that&#39;s an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">if one of the differentiators of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">is you know if we actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">something like a taskrabbit where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">a part of it is we&#39;re offering a service</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">and we take a small cut um</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a part of how we explain</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">it is okay here&#39;s you know how that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">money is being spent</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">but then when it comes to the projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">here&#39;s how those choices are made here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">you know what projects were funding</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">here&#39;s what those</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">projects have to be like here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">they can&#39;t be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">um that that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">and then i think one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">questions i have is if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">i mean this is really starting to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">compete in game a with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">some game b bits and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">part of it is how game a are we how</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">game b are we how do we move that needle</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">um and then in the interim how do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">compete with game a companies for</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">both customers and for talent like if</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a role that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">you know if you could if you were like</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">the kind of person that we&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">fill that role</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">but you could go work for you know for</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">google or a big company and be making</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">well into six figures and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">the initial sort of thing that we had</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">said last time was you know sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">paying people a decent wage</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.639" style="s2">but also kind of trying to cap the top</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.639" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">what like are we saying everyone makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">the same or are we just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t make the same but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">like a lower multiple where you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">even the ceo shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">be be making 30 times what</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">uh staff do or you know into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">hundreds of times if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">what the lowest paid person gets versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">the ceo</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">those are sort of the things that come</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">to mind when i think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">how this whole thing works um which i</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">think might be outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">topic of what we said this was which i</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">think the topic was just sort of how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">we make money</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">but i think part of that goes into how</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">do we market</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">or how do we position this organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">and a lot of it comes to answering those</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:46.319" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">so yeah i think um i think governance</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">i like how to how to spend that once you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">get it is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">big i mean i guess we have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">ideas is that it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">you know the first couple people that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">create it take home all the cash and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">and then yeah so that i think that as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">whole that will be a whole another topic</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">that we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">um also just something else on starting</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">um a lot of the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">uh in startups for the rest of us they</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">suggest a stair-step approach so start</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">with something simple especially if</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve never started a business before</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">even with like some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">um content or educational material you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">know where you can just write up a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">pdf and sell it so you do some research</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">and figure out what people want to know</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">you sell that and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">you know progressively make it bigger</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">which of course one of those step</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">bigger things is making a plug-in like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">adrian mentioned for</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">salesforce or something similar</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">wordpress</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">and then you can step up to creating you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">know actual apps and sas</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">offerings so that&#39;s just an idea i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">know if there&#39;s any i don&#39;t know that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">need to start smaller than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">salesforce plugins</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">and i guess also it might be good to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">have some place to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">throw down ideas or even ideas from</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">other people in game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">just a spreadsheet somewhere might be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">good idea um</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">yeah and then think through which ones</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">could we better</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">serve that that would have an edge being</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">from game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">either it&#39;s cheaper because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">being extractive</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">or it just operates substantially more</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">someone mentioned to me in another</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">meeting that on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">thing where you can rate companies that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">a lot of companies have a vested</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">interest to make sure that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">directly compare their products to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">which also means we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">lawsuits and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">or legal production but i hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">thought about it now that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">a problem right</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">um so any area where a game a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">company couldn&#39;t enter</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">or is a place that&#39;s not entered because</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:17.839" style="s2">their game a principles don&#39;t allow them</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.839" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">might if if there&#39;s if one of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">ideas kind of fits that then that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">optimal</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know how how legal it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">i haven&#39;t looked into it but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">other beautiful things that we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">going for us as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">are a global community and so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">something isn&#39;t legal in the states but</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">it&#39;s still ethical because we&#39;re game b</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">people then having that come out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">canada or australia or europe</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">so that it is legal there right like if</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">you can compare products in europe</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re allowed to enter products in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">the united states because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s part of right</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">like you just need to take a picture to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">enter a product and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">anyway yeah that we can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">a global community can have workarounds</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">for legality because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">the big corporations do right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">you can see us doing it we&#39;re we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">people getting together and doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it ethically right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s no ethical reason not to be able</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">to do that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">game a legal but you&#39;ll heard our bottom</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">they&#39;ll see it causes cancer i worked</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:29.680" style="s2">really hard on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">i think two panties point one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.680" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">early things will definitely be starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">to get some</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">sort of legal clout because i fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">expect like if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">like for something like a salesforce app</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t matter but once we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">actually start like comparing companies</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">and even things like having</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">like you know for wiki election for</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">example having profiles online</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">of people can get murky when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">things like gdpr</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">and that sort of thing where i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">that they&#39;ll be fighting even harder</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">against it</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">because they don&#39;t want their profile</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">online they don&#39;t want a permanent sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">you know their permanent record online</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">they want to you know that&#39;s fine to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">track it for citizens</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">but for us well wait hold on we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">want that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">um so yeah i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">one of the and that&#39;s probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">example of so if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">maybe something like customer support we</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:23.920" style="s2">would probably have them like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">in most companies that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">one of the lower paid roles so we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">to be able to decide</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.160" style="s2">what&#39;s the lowest pay that we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">willing to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">um you know so sort of how high is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">and then you get into something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">bull</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">okay if we say let&#39;s just say for</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">example that&#39;s 80 000</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">okay but then what do company lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">make because paying a lawyer 80 000 is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">almost the same as nothing as far as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">they&#39;re concerned in most cases because</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">i have an idea and i don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">would be a sales force one though but</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">you&#39;re the sales sports person</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">so marketing is one of the big game a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">things it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">um people like the company spends a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">of marketing to accrue</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">a customer and it&#39;s like salesforce&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">whole business is why it might not be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">sales force thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">but to be able to even offer that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">a businesses right as gay may as they</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">are to be like we</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">you want to find your right customer</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">right like the person who&#39;s going to be</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">how much does it cost right now to get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">customer</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">we have a we don&#39;t yet but we have a uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">a customer base of people who tell us</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.399" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">their values tell us what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:34.399" style="s2">and we&#39;re telling them the best option</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">right we&#39;re doing it in the game b way</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.399" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">this who</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">you act this is solves both of your</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">problem right this is omni win</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">looking for them we&#39;re working really</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">for the for the customer the member</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">but getting paid by connecting them to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">the business that is that is best right</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">so if they pay</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.519" style="s2">five bucks per accrual we&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pay us 450</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">right or like something so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">having a savings our person&#39;s happy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">we&#39;re getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">is that anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">you have to be careful with that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">that&#39;s often where</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">things tend to go wrong that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">have an incentive and i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">that&#39;s a reason not to do it but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">have an incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">push people towards the companies that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">will pay you if it&#39;s an open service not</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">everyone every company will</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">um now you know there are like affiliate</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">programs to where</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">um like amazon or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">so taking advantage of those that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">already out there would be good</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">yeah yeah i have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">transparency and how to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">no timer</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">is anything being which if it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">then it&#39;d be obvious if you mocked with</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">so yeah i&#39;m not sure i could think of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">way outside of just taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.320" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">what already is in game a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t cause perverse incentives</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">yeah and there are a few services like</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">that already that i think to bentley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">point you can sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">they started out well-intentioned and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">just you know probably just</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">somebody&#39;s project up the side of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">desk trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">you know compare companies and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">pretty quickly it got into oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">actually a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">really lucrative basket of information</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">they can sell and then it you know got</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">to like allowing companies to pay to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">improve their ranking and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">thing i think</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">if you had almost like embedded in just</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">how it works that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t do that i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">what that would look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely advantages but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">a there&#39;s a lot of people in that space</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">and b</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">it would be you know easy to go get</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">might be someone who already does this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">but one of so you know my</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">current rabbit hole is mlms which is of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">course the they have people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">cult like passionate about the project</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">selling it to people who are like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">last people you should trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">but anyway then a lot of influencer</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">a lot of times they do really like it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">but they&#39;re getting paid to do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">to be able to have a third party where</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">they or the company itself right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">makeup company preview company whatever</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t um that they&#39;re saying we want a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">hundred people to try this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">and we&#39;re the third party in between to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:23.040" style="s2">say okay we&#39;re going to give it to these</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">groups we&#39;re going to give an</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.040" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">honest review right these are the makeup</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">influencers</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">and they give an honest review and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">their reputation the influencers</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">reputation is like that they do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">honestly and they&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">getting paid from the company itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">and then you can actually trust it much</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">more and so there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">built into it</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">but the the issue would be right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">giving it to 10 influencers in that case</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">or 100 random people to try it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">to say whether or not they like it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">they&#39;re paying for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">right they&#39;re paying to say yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">third party</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:55.360" style="s2">these people like it</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">yeah another option might be just to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">allowed to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">paid sponsorship so they just get</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">displayed as blank is sponsoring this</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">and of course sponsoring a game b</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">would be pro game b i mean that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">would be something people would like</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">so they might get that additional</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">that feature on the system so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">searching oh i want to search for</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">businesses that promote gabby well then</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">we would be one of the the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">they could do that so maybe that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">less direct than a pay per</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">connection but that might be a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">of course one thing i hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">about too much about all this is how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">keep the system from being gamed</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i talked about that a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">little bit but i just got</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just filling my mind oh and i may</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">have to leave early so if i disappear</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">just ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.280" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">you&#39;re a mute dude</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">i was saying if you had the brick wall</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.160" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">you could disappear back into it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">oh that&#39;s muted and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">happened before we went we went live</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">oh yeah i mean this the point of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">conversation was just to spark ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">say what it what it was because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">more of the idea cafe not the together</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">tech um board meeting but it i&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">with it of course however</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">it goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">the third party someone&#39;s watching this</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.679" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">someone needs to take that on someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">create a way that we can actually trust</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">the durability</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">and comparing them and because even like</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">the influencers themselves right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">ones that are doing it well</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.120" style="s2">and have the youtube channels you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.120" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">right so you don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">being sponsored or not and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">to have that third party in between to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">be like okay you&#39;re the electronics</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">so you&#39;re getting these electronics and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">your job is to give them an honest</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">review</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">not to do a sponsorship so like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">yeah having that that trust built in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">electronics one wants people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s basically free advertising that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">pay for once and then people are going</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">to constantly look up these reviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">but you&#39;re going to get honest reviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">so even going through that third party</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">is going to get you credibility</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">right that like oh we&#39;re willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">it this way instead of the other way</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;ll be interesting to see how you</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.760" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">could sort of re-envision</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">the not even sponsorship but like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">review and sort of like what it is using</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">sponsorships because</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">they changed the rules on youtube and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">think it might just be like a u.s law</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">where now like if you&#39;re sponsored you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">have to say it clearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">um and a lot of people have gotten in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">trouble for not doing that um</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.760" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">but i wonder if you could sort of say i</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">think this may have been what you were</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">getting at jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">where like a company contacts this third</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">party you know or like a proxy like</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">where it&#39;s a company and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">you know you make i don&#39;t know baby food</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">so either we just deal</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">with one or ideally you you may even try</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">to reach out you know like three or five</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">and then you know you get their sample</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">products they the proxy</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">and then that company arranges with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">bunch of influencers to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">hey here&#39;s you know three to five kinds</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">of baby food</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">do a review on it you you don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">they are or you know or what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">paid or what they cost or anything just</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">say like what do you like and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">proxy knows you know here&#39;s product</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">abcde</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">in the end you can say hey here&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">know we we send this to 30 different</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">here&#39;s you know you can watch the actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">videos of each but then also here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">summary of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">oh if people didn&#39;t know what it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">they still picked you know this brand</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">half the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t think game a companies would pay</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">for that because there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">between my baby food is okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">and my baby food is the best because</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like one is just like does the baby</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">right the other one&#39;s like wait is it if</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">they have these six to choose from do</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">they choose it well if there&#39;s six you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">have a one in six chance right like</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">incentive just like pricing would didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">definitely change</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be able to make as much as</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">because with the sponsorship</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not a true review like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">probably aren&#39;t going to get paid if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">try it you&#39;re like oh this sucks like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">and if you did get paid no one&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">going to use you for sponsorship again</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">but if you had like each of the six</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">pays one-sixth of what they normally</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">would it is kind of a gamble</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s saying hey put your money where</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">your mouth is you&#39;re saying that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">your product</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">is decent if you want to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">and i i think to your point yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">would be hard to get companies involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:42.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">at least to start with because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.799" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">new thing you&#39;re saying hey spend money</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">you might get nothing out of this and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">think like you probably want some sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">uh a limit on the bottom part where like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got five companies</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">maybe you only say like the the top two</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">or three and you don&#39;t say who</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">the bottom ones are just so that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t like hey we we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">we we we paid money for this and we got</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">ranked as the bottom of six</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m never doing that again and like</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">other companies</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">might be like i don&#39;t want part of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">but if you just paid money and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">you know no good out of it but also no</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">then it might not be as bad and whereas</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">the company that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">paid the same as everyone else and got</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">ranked top</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:27.679" style="s2">they might do quite well and so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">might be enough to say okay well it is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.679" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">bit of a gamble</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">but what you get out of it is possibly</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">good enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">i was thinking it was like the company</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">itself would let&#39;s say give 100 headsets</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">us the company the third party we would</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">know which ones to give it to would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">randomized and they would go out to 100</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">different influencers 100 different</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">electronics ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">they would just give a review on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">headset right which is normally what</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">they do they don&#39;t necessarily compare</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">headsets because there&#39;s way too many on</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">the market anyway</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">they might compare it to the last one</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">they tried or like this is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">they know headsets because they&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">out so many of them so they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">already know what that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">curve is to give their opinion based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">it but they&#39;re doing it in a non in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">less biased way they they get the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">product for free</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">they get you know and maybe they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">even paid i don&#39;t know maybe that is all</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">they get</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">is because they&#39;re that is their point</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">of their channel right is to give</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">reviews and to give them honestly so</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">they&#39;re audience fully trusts them more</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">and they get free product but not in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">way that influences their</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">their right that is and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">company itself gave away 100 free</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">headsets</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t get to choose who gets it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">who&#39;s going to do that and but they get</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">that stamp of hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">these people reviewed your headset</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not as good of quality as</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">actually or you know like this this or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">this and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">there could also be because all these</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">people are doing it we can collect that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">data and give that to our customers</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">right that like hey out of all these</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">tried this headset they writed it this</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">way and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">whereas this headset is rated</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">differently and start collecting that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">data like it but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">single-sided deafness</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">you actually want this one if you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">if you&#39;re listening to music the music</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">ones wanted this one and the gamers</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">wanted this one</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">so it sounds a bit like maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s a little bit for marketing</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">because if you you know if the company</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">was picked as the top one they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">probably going to include that in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">in advertising but but it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">lot of it is just sort of like end user</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">testing</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">or like hey if you actually want real</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">on your products and not like to pay as</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">you know to pay someone to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">you can already do that now you you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">you you possibly already are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">but if you want this kind of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">then we can offer that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">yeah because i mean we i think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">customer is starting to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">five-star reviews aren&#39;t five-star</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">reviews right even on yelp even on</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">amazon</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">so sending it out to 100 people who are</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">both rating it honestly and you can have</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">a special stamp we don&#39;t have control</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">over yelp and google</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">but a special stem saying this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">third-party independent study and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">people themselves it&#39;s really hard just</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">like you have a better business bureau</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">stamp or that kind of thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;re really good are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">are you worth that price point are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">durable i mean they&#39;re not honestly</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">gonna know durability</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">but even that can be reported later on</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">and google does actually have a format a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">way that you can if you run a rating</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">site</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">say what the rating is and then if</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.640" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">someone google searches</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">and if your page happens to come up in</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">the ranking</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">the the rating will display where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">text is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s often uses stars or</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">something so it&#39;s pretty visible</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">um yeah i&#39;m just trying to think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">alternative that doesn&#39;t have such a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">it&#39;s still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of fitting a round peg and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">square peg and a round hole</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">kind of the feeling we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">find a place to build sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:08.000" style="s2">um and i think further to that point</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">a lot of the stuff that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.000" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">about so far requires an audience</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">and part of it is we kind of need money</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">to get an audience</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">or at least to help like grow it and to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">get and to possibly hire somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">that together tech and the projects can</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">use to sort of figure out hey what could</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">help us build audiences for together</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">tech four reason score four-week</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">for solution raising for all of them um</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">and so i think that&#39;s where there are a</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">avenues that we could use to start</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">making money but i think part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">which of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">already require us to either have an</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">audience or money and then which of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">are like oh we could do this now</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:53.520" style="s2">and i guess some of the unspoken options</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">is you know having a tour people can</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.520" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">optionally pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">for access to the service um</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">maybe you can get deeper i still like</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">that i don&#39;t like putting part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">feature set behind the wall</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">but deeper analytics when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">searching for</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know maybe the individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">people could hire people to go and do</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">research for them</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">where they can describe what they want</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">and then you know then we need to hire</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">someone to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:36.240" style="s2">to go out look at all the products put</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">them in the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.240" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">that might be something so it&#39;d be more</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">like they&#39;re sponsoring it to be put in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">the system because that data wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">just go to that person although</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">a lot of times it may be very personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">if someone is looking for a nanny that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">sign language right you know there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">people that would value that in the main</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">system you&#39;d still kind of put it there</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">and then also that would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">bootstrap the system as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">to get data in it but</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">yeah and then just have a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">badge on the site that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">you know we say you know we expect</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">x percent of your income or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">you know we suggest</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">a donation of x percent of your income</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re paying some</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">then uh there&#39;d be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">indicator so as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">interacting with community or other</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">people are seeing your reviews</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">your information you&#39;re putting in there</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">might be an indicator there</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t really know if that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">actually go anywhere though</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">i wonder if one of the things we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">um alluded to it earlier on</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">is to like just brainstorm everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">that could make money</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">whatever sell our children you know like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">like every</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">things that were and then how on how</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">game a how game b</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">they are how complicated they are and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:03.520" style="s2">how much they require us to have more of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">an audience than we do now</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.520" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">right how long are they take to make is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">there that beta version</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">and there might be one that pops out as</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">oh this is an obvious winner or</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">there might be an obvious no there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">reason we haven&#39;t made this yet</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s r and uh like figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">those categories are that we&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">score and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">also put it out to the game b community</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">of hey</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">we have the same problem again and again</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">that we can&#39;t finance projects that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">people need to be able to be paid</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">in order to be able to fund game b</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">projects we&#39;re looking to start one</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">to make living wages and fund future</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">it needs to be profitable like that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">the reason of this right the reason of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">this isn&#39;t necessarily to create game b</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing it that&#39;s the why</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">later um and including right how could</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">this be gamified how could this</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">how game a is it and how could it be</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">even more gameplay that we maybe can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">right yeah so i&#39;d almost rather say</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">i mean we so we could pursue adriel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">ideas but also maybe putting out to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:06.480" style="s2">game b communities let&#39;s brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">products and services that we personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">pay for and then we take a look at those</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">and see which of those have an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">in the game a market</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s game b and maybe see if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">brainstorm with the larger group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">a good idea one of the so one of the</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">oil company does a for-profit one and a</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">doing something similar to that where</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">we&#39;re all living in game a anyway</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">like you said what would you use as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">service but also like</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">something that is an act not a tech</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">project right that is um it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">things that came up during our climate</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">change solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:16.640" style="s2">that that daniel had mentioned is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">like picking one product to make super</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">you have that might be able to be used</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">you know to make money to be able to pay</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">for game b projects</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">but then also what would it need to look</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">like in order for you to be willing you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">know to share</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">ideas that you think are because i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">a lot of people they&#39;re kind of both</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">gaming and game b at the same time like</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">game b sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">but also right now existing in game a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">and also</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">some people are liars and some people</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">might be you know pretending to be game</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">b and then they get a game</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">idea and say actually never mind game a</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">is great and then they just switch to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">making money</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">um so i think part of it is both the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">what you know ideas could we move</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">forward with that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">you know sort of our next steps that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">could feasibly do</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">right now or soon um but then also if</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">you have ideas like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">what would you need to see from that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">organization like what would it need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">be structured like</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">in order for you to participate</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">um and that might end up i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">sort of at least two different sides</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">just the idea and there&#39;s also the like</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">actually participate and you know keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">actively work on it um</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">and then you know i guess there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">of two different</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">versions of that there&#39;s like what would</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">it take for you to work on a project now</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">and participate</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">and you wouldn&#39;t really get anything out</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">of it unless it was successful and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">like you&#39;re still sort of taking all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">same risk that you would in game a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">but then possibly not getting as much of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">a payout versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">what could you do you know what would</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">the organization have to to look like</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">for you to participate but also keep in</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">mind that organization is helping to</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">alleviate some of that risk like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">you know have staff help or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">actually able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">contribute some money towards it then</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">that is an obvious thing we&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">so that&#39;s how it&#39;s different from game a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like an investor but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">investing sort of both of those steps</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">if that makes sense i think that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">important one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">like when you start have a startup</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">especially a tech startup it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">common that you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">um don&#39;t get paid because the idea you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">get that big payoff in the end right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">with the mlms all of it it&#39;s like oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">taking on all this time and risk</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">even though i don&#39;t think it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">rise to become rich one day</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">that there&#39;s like a collective vision</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">which is what game b is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">right that is like this is humanity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">richness right like this humanity</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">getting to be on a yacht and a mansion</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s our equivalent we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.399" style="s2">all its mansions right like what</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">what does that future need to look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">for you that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">enough of an incentive that you put time</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">in right and how little or much time is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">that right like for solution raisings</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">i&#39;m like you get envisioned a better</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">world it&#39;s literally an hour a week i</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t understand it&#39;s not money it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">not it but</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">like they don&#39;t even know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">possibility they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">know what those things are</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">hello hello hello sorry for me it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">part of the very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">conversation from the subject</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">suggests money money money</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">we&#39;re getting very game a up in here</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">figuring out how to make money</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">not really we&#39;re still game b people so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">what&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">it&#39;s still generally oh yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">we talked through a few ideas but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">thought maybe best to do a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">survey of game b people</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">ask him what products would they be</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">willing</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">i&#39;d almost phrased it as</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">what products would you be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">pay a little more for</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">if it was a game b company that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">non-extractive</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">because i think we know if we can do for</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">less of a price</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">then everyone would in game be they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">more likely to do it</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">and then or but also maybe ask them the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">question what are some products that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">products or services that you think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">if it was done by a game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">company it would have an edge</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">in the game a marketplace that because</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">we&#39;re not being extractive</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">or because other than the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">people in game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">would use it like we might get some sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">edge like there i think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">businesses that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">just don&#39;t work because people want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">protect their</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">intellectual property right but since</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t care so much about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">intellectual property i mean someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">could steal the idea and redo it</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">um that maybe we can do stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">so just</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">i guess kind of just think through what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">are some</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">what are some market advantages that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">gamebee philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">naturally has</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a good more focused like</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">asking gamebee what products they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">willing to pay a little bit more for for</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">and more omni win solution</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">and instead of and then if you because</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think anyone needs an</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">incentive to give that idea i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">telling you i want toilet paper you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">might steal it right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s more and then that other part is an</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">important part for later for together</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.880" style="s2">attack right like if you have an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">idea what would get you to bring it here</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.880" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like two different</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">i guess also there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">business areas where people would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">also be willing to pay more</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">but because it&#39;s a game b company you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">maybe like if there&#39;s an industry where</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s traditionally done</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">through slave labor or oppressive labor</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">in other countries right</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">then that would be something that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">already some companies are using that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">but it&#39;d be like a tom shoes or</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">where yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">so so far the sort of different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">that i&#39;m seeing to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">is what are the projects that we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">do now versus later so what&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">like a next step that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">without needing money and resources and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">an audience</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">versus like obviously if we have time</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">and money and audience people</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">working on a project there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">things that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">there&#39;s the question of what like actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">idea do you have for you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">a company product service or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">versus just</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">what products would you buy if they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">better in certain of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">these aspects um and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">from that question is what would the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">organization or products need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">to look like what would be the unique</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">aspects either for you to feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">contributing your idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">or that you would be more willing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:54.079" style="s2">spend your money as a consumer with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.079" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">um and then the part of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">which product or service or company</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">would get an advantage because of its</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">attributes like being omni winner being</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">anti-rival risks that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">versus just which do we think would do</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">better because the company is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.800" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">that game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">feel good market positioning like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">the tom shoes</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">as far as i know that&#39;s purely sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">uh people want to contribute in that way</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">not so much because of the way it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">it has some innate</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">advantage that&#39;s sort of the four</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">different parts to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">question that i can see right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">what product would you buy or what</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">service would you like to subscribe to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">right i&#39;m just thinking what services</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">would be the most beneficial tool uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">game b type people new facebook</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">yeah and i think one of the traps that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">we could really easily fall into here</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">is the example that jubilee gave with</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">mounting with mountain equipment co-op</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">where they asked their members hey what</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">do you want and the members told them</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">and then they went and built this new</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">fancy thing you know with less</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">slave labor and less environmental</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">impact the people said great that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">expensive i&#39;m gonna go buy it from</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">walmart</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">okay and so i think part of it is how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">we avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:22.160" style="s2">how do we actually you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">going to go through the effort of doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.160" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">the research and making</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">the the thing which i think no matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">what any time that that we&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be later because we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">to go through like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">investment of you know the procurement</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">and the creation and the marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">the actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">shipping of things um if you do well</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">enough you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">can get people to pre-order so</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">true and that is like i i matush</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">actually use the word subscription and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">is a good that&#39;s a good system right</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">that there&#39;s like the dollar shave club</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">and stuff to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">what kind of things in your life would</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">you put in a subscription for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">we know what the you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna order detergent every month</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re committing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">that for the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">but like yes i want laundry detergent i</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">want toothpaste</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">i want this thing and even going out and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">doing more of a buyer&#39;s club</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">where we&#39;re actually looking for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.640" style="s2">already on the market</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">and offering like like bulk buying it</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.640" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">and then putting it out into</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">into like here&#39;s the top 10 right</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">toothpaste deodorant whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">um and getting them subscription where</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.599" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">i&#39;m maybe going down rabbit holes but</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">subscription is what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">well that&#39;s interesting doing a group</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">buyers</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">we may be too spread out for the real</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">benefits of that to be but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">maybe not um but that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">because we&#39;d have a similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">rubric or decision making for what</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">products to buy not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">because people are different needs but</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">but yeah maybe if we know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">you know they&#39;re this this of all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">companies this is the least extractive</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">and maybe using the tool we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">about where people give feedback</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">so the group would come together i</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">really think also using reason score to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">make that decision</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">would be helpful because people put in</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">all the evidence they know about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">company and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">based on that i would come to a group</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">decision on which</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">company to buy the products is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">expense is the delivery</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s like collecting the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">both buying it and delivery</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">and in that it&#39;s like right you get it</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">once per month right everyone gets it</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">like maybe you actually go pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">from a warehouse in vancouver right</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">maybe that is part of what makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">it cheap or you&#39;re paying extra to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">it delivered directly to your house</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">but like it&#39;s that it goes to vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">right so i get my toothpaste my</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">deodorant my whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">i can pick it up for my neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">ways that we can do this together that</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have to look like</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">amazon or</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">you know and nick</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">had some similar things uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">where he was figuring out areas for</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">people to work together in</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that could be leveraged</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">i&#39;ll say one of the things i like about</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">the buyers club is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">that if we&#39;re pooling money together to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">say like hey let&#39;s you know go buy shoes</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">or toothpaste or well</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">whatever there&#39;s a i think you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">vacuum or something happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">so you&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">there we go</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:31.440" style="s2">one of the interesting things about a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">buyer&#39;s club is that if let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.440" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">you know we say okay let&#39;s go out and do</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:37.040" style="s2">a toothpaste</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">subscription that i think is an easier</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">way to have the conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">what would the organization or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">product need to look like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">unique aspects</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">because you aren&#39;t talking theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">then you&#39;re saying like no no we have 10</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:48.720" style="s2">options</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">what questions do we need to ask to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.720" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">able to pick one</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">um and then you know you might end up</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">with something like reason score where</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">okay we identified these five you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">attributes that we want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:03.599" style="s2">score on and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">there&#39;s both the here&#39;s how those are</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.599" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">scored and then here&#39;s how the group has</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:09.760" style="s2">weighted things based on our</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:12.720" style="s2">understanding of what the group wants</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.760" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pick this one who&#39;s still in</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.720" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">because you might say like oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">interested in the idea of a buyer&#39;s club</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">but i just you know really don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:22.240" style="s2">with the attributes that we picked for</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">for toothpaste so i&#39;m gonna skip out</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.240" end="00:44:26.400" style="s2">on this one but at the very least you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">got those attributes and you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.400" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">of the the scoring happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">and that i think is a way better way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">have that conversation than just a</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">theoretical hey what would a company</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">look like for you to want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">buy things from them</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">which is way too nebulous for i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">people to really</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">resonate with and you know pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">to an answer</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">i like the idea that was coming up</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">because of my mlm obsession right now is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">like having a city sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">like once you have 100 people in a city</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">that&#39;s when it starts right like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:58.400" style="s2">when you can get it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">delivered to that city and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.400" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">there&#39;s five or six products that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.760" style="s2">get and you can buy like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s based on the volunteer hours of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.760" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">people going and sorting those boxes</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">from that space or we sort it into</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">central location and send it out in</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">boxes</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">but that there is we&#39;re working to bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">together like what toothpaste is out</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">there that isn&#39;t crest and colgate</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">what detergent is out there and working</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">with the companies to be like what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">want is less packaging what we want is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">you know not to to have sulfites and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">all these things in it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">um yeah working with i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">omni-win like i think that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s also something that like with</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">what happens here with the um container</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">stores and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">if you can get stuff that doesn&#39;t that</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">like hemp toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">should be what we&#39;re all using i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:59.119" style="s2">understand how it&#39;s not but it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">any company that starts</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">and and and</p>

<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">like they have their own brand and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">they&#39;re actually creating it and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">you&#39;re getting that stuff at cost</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">because you&#39;re paying a subscription fee</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want to make our own</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">products necessarily that&#39;s a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing that same thing where</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">you&#39;re paying a subscription fee to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">and we&#39;re sourcing it with you and for</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">and then there&#39;s that little tiny bit of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">a fee on top because this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">or or if there isn&#39;t because you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">paying the subscription 50 bucks you</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">might be thinking of brandless</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">maybe yeah better stuff fewer dollars</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">sounds right i heard something about</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">them i thought they were having some</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:40.720" style="s2">trouble but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">um yeah i saw another company that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.720" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">showing me ads on facebook a while ago i</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think it was brand</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t sound familiar but i</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.559" style="s2">think it was the same basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">where it was yeah you pay us monthly we</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">you know are making stuff at cost and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">the issue is so how do i trust you right</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">like you&#39;re still</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">we we can&#39;t necessarily say that but we</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">have the ingredients list</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not the middle man we&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">people making the toothpaste and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">therefore trying to save money on it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">like and i they might be too because</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">it&#39;s about getting giving it a cost so</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">like being transparent with that cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">we&#39;re like look the company told us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">two bucks yours is 220.</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">okay like it&#39;s it&#39;s uh we made it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s the same price is what you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">would buy off the website you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">it all shipped to us you&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">for shipping you&#39;re getting it all</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">at this price and the company gets to</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">stay in business</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">yeah so brandless did shut down they had</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">a funding issue but they&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">open and they&#39;re focusing on staying</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:42.000" style="s2">profitable i think they took</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">on too much um uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.000" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">too much funding and then couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">maintain the evaluation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">everything but</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">also like if you need to have an entire</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">catalog of goods that you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:59.680" style="s2">that is huge especially during this time</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">whereas finding people that already</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.680" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">doing that and bringing them customers</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">is a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">and i think colleen and harris might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">the people because they have their</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">online farmers market there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">about that that&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">what can how does this this go together</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">in a product</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">an interesting thing is that part of one</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">of the things that people like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">in this community is um local</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">and you lose kind of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">centralized deficiencies when you go</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">local so</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we could think of it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">be interesting to work with them to see</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">if there&#39;s anything we can think of</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">to do for the local although if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">doing it on a city basis like</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">jubilee suggested then then definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">local would work</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:42.800" style="s2">what i was thinking was like you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">the local farmers market right with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.800" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">food that&#39;s created and you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">still delivering to those</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">to people and so you have what what</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">they&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">a you know beautiful efficient way</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">creating a website people want to use</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">you can use between cities as a customer</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">but the local and then that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">same organization is also getting the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">the shipment from like i don&#39;t know if i</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">need my toothpaste made locally i might</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:04.960" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">like getting those things shipped and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">putting your box as well so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">adding these subscription things onto it</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s not because it&#39;s open and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">transparent it&#39;s not as high as the cost</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">as going to whole foods and buying it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re not having having to support</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">bezos right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">yeah and we if we have a customer base</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">of people who care about this this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">necessarily even spuds in vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:25.839" style="s2">who&#39;s still an awesome company but like</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t really care if they succeed</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.839" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">whereas if it&#39;s ours that we own</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">together that is something that is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">i do care if it succeeds i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">able to continue buying this toothpaste</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">we&#39;re helping the little the little</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">companies the local farmers</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">and who&#39;s not going to sign up for it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">right like if it&#39;s actually a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s not as expensive as going to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">farmers market and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">open it gets delivered to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">i was thinking if possible with the like</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">trying to find people in the same city</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">what what might be like along that same</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">route and possibly even more</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">i guess efficient both with the finding</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">groups of people and uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">making more efficient within the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">city is finding people like</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:08.160" style="s2">starting off by targeting people in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">same apartment buildings</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.160" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">so you can say like hey if we can find</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">five apartment buildings in the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">city you know with at least 20 people</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">per</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">per building then things like delivery</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">become easier we&#39;re like oh yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">deliver to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">4x costs where you&#39;re now sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">delivery with everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">in the building and then you just have</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:26.640" style="s2">to go down to the lobby and pick it up</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">or you know the delivery could actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.640" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">go door-to-door and that that that could</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">built into it and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">would actually be working like</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking it&#39;s harder to find a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">building that happens to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">people who have the same ethics in it</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">right that are in but you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t is the people who work for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">specific company so like in vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">van city</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">right like the van city headquarters be</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">like hey do you want your food delivered</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">and then you i don&#39;t know how you do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">as far as keeping it cold throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">day so it gets to them but</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">whatever that it gets like they get it</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2">delivered to their work</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">they&#39;re there during the day and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot easier to find 20 people</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">working at vancity who have these values</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">then 20 people at a random apartment</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">building has its values right</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">right that seems like a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">starting point like if it because</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.040" style="s2">i i mean i&#39;m not sure how how many of us</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">have worked in offices</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">at least recently but like it was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">fairly common thing to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">buy lunch together well if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">service where the whole purpose was kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">of like a combination of groupon</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">and ubereats where it was like hey we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">deliver it to your building and again if</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">you can schedule it it may be even</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">we can say hey you know we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">contacted five or ten restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">in this area on tuesdays you know you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">can get</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">four tacos for four dollars or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">the price ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">and so it sort of ends up being that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">like there is that innate we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">actually building anything we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">looking to get the buyers and sellers</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">taking a small cut</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">but like they&#39;re like i i would have</p>

<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna keep the other ones out you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">don&#39;t get it like it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:55:51.520" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">office buildings you get that but so do</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">other people so do the other restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re helping all restaurants i do</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">think that almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">no matter what the first few solutions</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">are going to be something tech based</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">so that it&#39;s just innately scalable and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">whether that&#39;s like an online</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">solution that that we consulted to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">world or some sort of a tech platform</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">that helps you know some sort of a local</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">for it to be like truly scalable and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s kind of what the first few</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.559" style="s2">things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the vibe i i get is that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.559" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">first few should be</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">so that we can have some funds to to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">you know pay people and to pay for our</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">but then also to pay for the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">projects to make more money</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">because once you have money it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">to make money</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">thanks gaming</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">things like reason score and converati</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">that starts to dissolve because that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">one of the the things that i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">people do care it&#39;s just not</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">either have to change it or they get</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">trounced like they get crushed in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">news and people stop buying from them</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">and then they have to make a big</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:23.359" style="s2">improved this</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">or they sink well concealing the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.359" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">is a</p>

<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">more they&#39;re actually inves involved and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:47.520" style="s2">aware of it</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">whatever it is we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">and every kind of innovation goes to</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:04.240" style="s2">and so like game b has a big advantage</p>

<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">the owners and even then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">because you&#39;re still a stakeholder in</p>
