<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">we discussed his book the listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:05.439" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to mostly focus on his</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">second book</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:09.760" style="s2">nordic ideology i actually started</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">reading nordic ideology first</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">and i figured hey i&#39;m a reasonably smart</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">fellow i can interpolate from context</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">what i need from</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:18.560" style="s2">the first book the listening society</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">well it turned out i was wrong by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.560" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">time i got to about the 45</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">mark according to my kindle in nordic i</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">realized i really need to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">read the listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">so i did so that&#39;s what i&#39;d suggest if</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">you find this book really interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">suggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">make the effort and read listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">society first then nordic audiology</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">nonetheless in the spirit of getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">listeners up to speed</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to ask hanzi to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">couple of the key concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.240" style="s2">from the first book the listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">society before we jump into nordic</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.240" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">and the core of the first book is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">an idea that hanzi calls the effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">value meme</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s essentially a four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.920" style="s2">of thinking about human adult</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.880" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.920" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">so hanzi why don&#39;t you tell the audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">about the effective value i mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:07.119" style="s2">in some level of detail take a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.119" end="00:02:11.680" style="s2">well thank you first uh for welcoming</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">back uh me back to the show</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.680" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">i&#39;d like to say then about effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.640" style="s2">value meme that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">a lot of people are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.640" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">something quite similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">uh namely um value memes from the spiral</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">dynamics uh thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">and it&#39;s just not just in the spiral</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">dynamics uh framework it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">all over develo adult development</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">psychology really that people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:38.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just actually in adult</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">development psychology it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.440" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">anthropology those anthropologists that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">or again start believing in the stage</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">development and the evolution of stages</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">of societies</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">they notice that there is a pattern here</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">they notice that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">um people in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">smaller societies and and farther back</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">in history tend to believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">more in magic and then rituals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">rights for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">and things go on from there to larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">and larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">core principles or universal stories or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">and perhaps gods or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">one god over all gods which</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">which unify many people many</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">and so on and find one higher truth the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">truth higher than any person</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">and then people go on from there to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">noticing that hey there are many visions</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">one god there are many visions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">objective reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">so um and and then in modern society</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">that objective reality seems to break</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">down under the weight of so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">perspectives some people start to wander</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">into what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">post-modern uh perspectives and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">and so so these things align</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">history psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:05.159" style="s2">personality they they align around</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">some kind of stages which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.159" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">recognizable</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">and even in any society then people</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">aren&#39;t just of one stage that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">correspond to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">society rather you can see on the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.079" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">hand that people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">learned a certain code or demeanor or</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">world view from the society that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been brought up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">but at the same time we also develop</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">as human beings as persons some people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">never really grasp the society and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">we&#39;re in or have and go back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">ways of grasping the world that which</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">would have resonated more with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">earlier societies others go on and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">pick up more conventional views and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">start to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">post-conventional views which may</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">intuit perhaps societies of the future</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">or future forms of human life and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:08.880" style="s2">life philosophies so an example would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.880" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">in late medieval times there were some</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">of uh of the renaissance and modernity</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">for instance roger bacon</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">this monk was before his time in i</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">may have been the late 13th century and</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">uh he intuited that we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">study nature and we and there will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">wagons that roll without without horses</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">and there will be</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:47.199" style="s2">and he didn&#39;t really know about any of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">the technology or couldn&#39;t guess on it</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.199" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">2020s for instance and then a</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">would be more authoritarian and you</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">modern values would be perhaps more</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">well a materialist reductionist world</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">view for instance and post-modern values</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">well seeing the world more relationally</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">and having more egalitarian views and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">wanting to soften the hard and harsh</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">life and society so</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">the the problem i noticed with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">developmental view was that people seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">to fit in some ways within these</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">categories and in others they didn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">some people were complex thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">and but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">spiritually relatively relatively flat</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">some people have profound</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">emotional and spiritual depths</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">but they&#39;re not necessarily super smart</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">some people are very learned</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">in terms of all the progressive ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">but understand them in flattened ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">and so so they have they&#39;re reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">cliches</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">and so on so there appear to be at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">four four dimensions then</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">that put together is not a necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">value meme that is recognizable as such</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">but if you put them together</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.000" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">there is still a pattern that is vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">recognizable</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i call them effective</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:57.279" style="s2">valuement meme</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">in effect this person will reproduce the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">values of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">modern society why well because they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">you mentioned four four dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">they are at a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">complexity in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">thinking they have a certain world view</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">which they have imbued from</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">our surroundings they have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">certain level of introspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">individuation or dividuation as a human</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">being knowing their own emotions and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">and defining their own self and their</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">own life philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">and they may have a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">subjective states or</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">or happiness which facilitate this kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">life and participation and this these</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">kinds of values i mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">feel really bad about yourself all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">time it&#39;s just difficult to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">achiever democrat for instance</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">or have the patience to believe in in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">scientific world view</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">if things get too rocky maybe a magical</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">with quick fixes will be more tempting</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">so these put together i&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">yes spiral dynamics and yes uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">developmental psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">anthropologists you are on to something</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">we should just</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">pick these dimensions apart and put them</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">back together</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">and this has certain i mean it makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">a few things a lot easier like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">conventional</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">spiral dynamics or developmental</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">psychologists which look at this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">one dimensionally they run into problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">whenever they look at people</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">compare people from two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">societies so let&#39;s say you have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">medieval genius</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">and you have a contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">14 year old from i don&#39;t know mexico or</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">whatever average country of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">and um the the medieval genius let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s thomas of aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">uh in his adult life and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">compare the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">14 year old mexican of today well they</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">were taught physics in school right</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">so they have a more advanced world view</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">and they understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">the nature of reality better than</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">the most complex mind of a generation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">a whole continent</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">which i mean somehow we know this</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">so we will just say that the kid has</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">acquired a more advanced code because</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">were brought up in in a larger society</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">with with more complex code but thomas</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">of aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">is more capable of uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">making um an independent uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">thought pattern or idea and he will</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">bring more emotional depth to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">his search for the truth so so in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">maybe you can say that thomas of aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">has higher</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">effective value mean than the 14 year</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">old</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">or maybe just different in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">four-dimensional space right</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">to put your labels on it first dimension</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">you called hierarchical complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">had 15 levels which seemed reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">enough going all the way back to the</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">um and if you can&#39;t do that then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">feel really sad about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">and then you go into your body wants to</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">but states are just the the sense of</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">feel feeling alive has this</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">profound sense of directness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">openness and crispness to it and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">are high states</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">when we&#39;re in heaven in some sense which</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">is not the same as just being happy</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">we can even be sad in heaven if our</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">heart opens up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">flows and it&#39;s like river and uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">everyone is forgiven and things are</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">brought back into harmony through this</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">for instance so that would be a high</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">state with uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">with a sad emotion but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">on the other side of the states there</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">are like</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">if you get stuck i don&#39;t know in a bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">dream</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">or you wake up at night and things just</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">don&#39;t make sense and the reality doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">seem to fit together and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a profound terror or</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">darkness or</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">on a bad psychedelic trip for instance a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">lot a lot of people these days have</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.279" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">and they can feel stuck in an internal</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">eternal loop</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s worse than death that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">you fall out into a space of nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">which is just pure terror for instance</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">those are real</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">really low states um and what when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">uh then encounter going from the states</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">to the depth when you encounter</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">spiritual particular practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">you can notice things about them they</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">will when they say</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">stuff about their uh purpose in life it</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">uh something more universal and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">and spiritual and something more</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">embodied and felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">and when when you look them in the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">they will be</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">a little bit like they have like these</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">deeper tunnels</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">of their eyes uh inside them uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">and if you look at their movements they</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">tend to be a little bit softer at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">when they</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">when they approach certain states that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">have to with their depth</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">and this comes from from hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">contemplative work</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">which generally speaking means</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">integrating those states so those states</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">put those states can put you like put</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">your whole system</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">or nervous system in a certain state yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">but could you go from there to remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">that state to make it a part</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">of who you are as a person to make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">into a trait that&#39;s the depth part</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">that&#39;s you remember that oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.160" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">life really is a kind of potential</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">heaven</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">right life really is a potential hell</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">sense those things um</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">on a very real and visceral level and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">you remember them and those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">recurring drives in your life then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">take life both much more seriously on</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">the dark side</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">and you take life much more as as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">cosmic joke on the light side</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">um and and that&#39;s kind of depth uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">not well it&#39;s a half a theory i&#39;ll admit</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s there&#39;s something there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">what i find is that these deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.519" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">people they align spontaneously with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">uh ideas ideas about complexity ideas</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">or which i feel pertain to</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">now the problem is as we discussed last</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.400" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">time the high depth people</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">if they&#39;re not also complex thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">have good code they</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">tend to fall into magical thinking um</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">uh that&#39;s another story so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">developmental qualities they come with</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">risks</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">and they come with downsides so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">you&#39;re really really</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">complex thinker but you&#39;re not very deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">be crude or reductionist but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">really really deep but you&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">complex you fall into</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know eckhart hall is stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">and a cartel is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">he has high stakes he has great depth</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">but if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">open his books and read his theories</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">about humanity and reality or</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">or listen to his commentary on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">going on in the world it&#39;s it&#39;s gobbly</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">yep we see that a lot unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">thank you for that good review and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">particularly for</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">elucidating depth well help me</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">understand it a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">i must say since i read the book and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">also particularly since we had our</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">conversation i have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">using this four-dimensional model and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">trying to think about the world and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">sharing some of the ideas with some of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">my friends particularly in the game b</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">space and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">actually in game b land people are now</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">using this language to a greater or</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">lesser degree</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">and while as you say is it actually a a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">solid theory yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">no but is it a useful rule of thumb or</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">heuristic i&#39;d say yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:12.799" style="s2">and i have a thought or two i like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.320" style="s2">run back by you and see what you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">in the thinking and conversations i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.320" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">had one of the thoughts is that state is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">relatively easy to modify</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">give someone some lsd and you&#39;ll change</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">their state right</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">but the effect may not be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">about what that change is and may not</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">last long a lot of the research done on</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">is that the biggest effect is about six</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.080" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">on the other hand for some people the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">trip is sufficiently strong it also</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">impacts their depth and then they will</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">say that it had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">you know a lifetime&#39;s worth of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">experience but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s you know kind of a random weapon in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">some sense hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">what the effect will be and how long</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">it&#39;ll last hierarchical complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">probably the most powerful single</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">dimension of your model</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">but two things one it has i think all</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">the evidence shows so far</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">significant innate component right</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">mental horsepower</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">is you know somewhere between 50 and 80</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">heritable or at least the capability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">that of course it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">realize that the achieved</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">cognitive complexity is a mixture of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">both innate</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">and environment if you have gene set x</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">raised in a cave by a wolf you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">going to develop a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">hierarchical complexity</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">and then here&#39;s the other one from terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">of the levers on society</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">really it takes a lifetime of effort to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">move it up</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s a slow hard process</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">so that had brought me to think this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">what i&#39;d love to get your reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">that code is probably the most salient</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.640" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">lever point</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">because code affects the others right if</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">you have the right code you have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">culture that engenders hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">complexity to the level people have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">capability</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">if you have the right code that means</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">ways of treating each other that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">greater state</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">greater state in some cases will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">greater depth</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m thinking that for those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">what comes next and building a better</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">world putting a lot of our effort in</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">code is useful in fact in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">some of our foundational documents were</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">written by a guy named jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">collaborator of mine and he has put them</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">in a collection called deep code</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">that you can find on medium just type in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">jordan hall deep code</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">and you&#39;ll get there i guess one final</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">thought before i get your reaction</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">when i tried to really think abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">about what the nordic ideology book</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">is one could say it&#39;s a code book</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">essentially but a code book that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">provides</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">routines in the code to affect the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">three states so with that i&#39;ll let you</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">react</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">well so so first of all uh bingo uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">i i very much agree um and um</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">and i mean there are a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">uh to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">to say about this but yes that&#39;s why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">a writer</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">i mean uh when i was younger i was very</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">interested in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">still am but i i think like</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">well whatever i can do or achieve uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">as a singular human being in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">regard is just not scalable and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">transferable</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">uh to the same degree so that&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">for this reason i didn&#39;t pursue um</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">a life of more pure spirituality you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">practice uh complex thought uh and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">it can be leveraged so so so when when</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">you look at mhc</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">uh people keep coming back to me about</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">this and i i</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">i appreciate that you that you bring the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">realist perspective here which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">my perspective also people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">tenacious about this that they really</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">really want us to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">uh to they really want mhc to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">uh movable and learnable the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">complexity the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">stage of cognitive complexity of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">person and they want to shake up their</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">friends and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">or or climb or we ourselves climb</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">in in cognitive complexity and sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">these things do happen i mean the 15</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">stages but depending on how you count</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">you could count up to 17 stages even</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">and everybody passes through these</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">stages and and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">passes at least to stage i mean a normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">adult will pay a pass to stage 9</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">10 11 or 12. so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s plenty</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">so uh so this happened 12 times already</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">in somebody&#39;s life since you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">fetus um so which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">so so in one way it&#39;s apparently</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">the most movable one but once you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">an adult human being here and now and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:56.320" style="s2">you sit down with them</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">what are you going to do like to change</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">the complexity of somebody&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">this is how radical it is you will have</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">i mean the the demand would be you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">have to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:13.440" style="s2">start inventing patterns of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">according to more complex patterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.440" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">which their brain has thus far never</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">formed</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.559" end="00:24:21.039" style="s2">in their life so i mean you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:23.679" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.039" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">over over over the dinner table right</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.679" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">you can affect</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">perhaps the whole environment over a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">with exposure and with practice and with</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">scaffolding meaning uh help from other</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">repetition then perhaps these things can</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">be shifted</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:41.679" style="s2">and these things align with stuff they</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">they find in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.679" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">if you study the the uh the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.240" style="s2">algebra of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">patterns in their brains you can see</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.240" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">that thoughts go up to 11 dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">and this may actually mirror</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:01.520" style="s2">a lot of what it means to uh to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">patterns of different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.520" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">more parts of your brain work together</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">and then you kind of see something more</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">abstract than you can that you can name</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">and our language often stops working</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">after a while</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">but all the sciences do point in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">direction of higher complexity</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">so you can climb this but it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s really really hard to do something</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">with an actual person</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">what is very actionable like you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">again i can&#39;t say better myself is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">code system</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">meaning that given that there is a large</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">subpopulation of high complexity</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">high state relatively high state and uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">and a higher depth than usual than</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">the norm then these people can be armed</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">with or</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">equipped or cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">higher stage of complexity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">their code</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">meaning that the the base suppositions</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">about reality about society</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">about uh where we&#39;re going about our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">place in it about how we define</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">ourselves about how we define</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">all of these things can change</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">relatively easily all you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">and grok some new ideas and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">start using them</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">that being said um those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">are only really usable to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">subportion of the population which have</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">the corresponding complexity so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">left with a challenge to develop all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">these dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">because just ideas just code with</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">with it no brains to run them</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">no hearts to fill it and so on is of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">course meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one one reaction the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">other reaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">that i have is the metamodernist</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">wars the culture wars or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">metamodernist version of culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">which we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">and people will will have noticed one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">four dimensions as fundamental to life</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">so some people will have noticed state</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">whoa if people could only</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">understand the power of zen vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">and some other profound practice or</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">or a psychedelic perhaps experience and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">so on uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">and and maybe a training program and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">uh some</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">some health stuff things that help your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">sleep and they then they notice how</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">awake you feel how alive you feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:39.120" style="s2">and they say okay here&#39;s here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">answer on all the rest is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">other people will go to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">group dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">workshops and then they&#39;ll work on their</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">traumas and masculinities and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">get in touch with their deepest emotions</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">be brave and cry about childhood</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">stuff that happened to them and get</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">their insecurities out in the open and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">own that stuff and then they&#39;ll feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">stronger more integrated and they will</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">see whoa</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">this is and all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">like you can pour how many words or</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">intellectual ideas but this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">really change a person and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:16.799" style="s2">they&#39;re also right and some people will</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">hey people are looking at the world flat</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">and i see</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.640" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">spheres and they&#39;re seeing circles and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">we should get people to be more complex</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">we should get people to think in more</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">multi-dimensional ways and we should get</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">people to grok</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">more abstract realities so that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">can together</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">resonate on more wicked and abstract</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">topics</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">which require us to grasp topologies and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">and fractals and all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">which our brains are actually capable of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">and those will emphasize growth</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">and cognitive complexity and then there</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">is the code people</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">who will have one or two or three or</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">five favorite ideas and philosophies and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">they will be in love with process</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">philosophy maybe they will be in love</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">with complexity theory or something else</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">and they say if people only understood</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:15.880" style="s2">this so what we have here is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">like i believe we should see this</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.880" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">multi-dimensionality</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:21.279" style="s2">and we should see that code is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">the greatest leverage point but of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.279" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">in the in the long run all four are are</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">equal and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">people should stop fighting about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">stuff and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">see that we got different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">elephant</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">and then think about code as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">help up regulate the other three</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">and of course vice versa so yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">right let&#39;s move on a little bit let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">get into the book itself a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">one of the things i 100 agree with this</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">woken up to however</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.120" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">is the fact that we can change the</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">areas i&#39;ve done a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">is monetary theory and alternative</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">and it drives me crazy that people have</p>

<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">and they confuse money with wealth for</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.240" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">accidents and conscious design decisions</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">that have given us a</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">specific set of social institutions</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">norms and beliefs</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">took that as</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">the deepest theme of your book actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">the particular section which you which</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">it has to do with the with this shift</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">from from</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">seeing that we can change the natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">world to seeing that we can change</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">the the social world and in a way it</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">sounds</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">it sounds obvious but it but it really</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">isn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">that before the natural sciences</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">made this great entrance into reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">into our our shared view of reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">we had no idea i mentioned roger bacon</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">that some few people could see like okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">if you really understand the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">the physical nature of things you can</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">stuff that you couldn&#39;t imagine you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.919" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">cars run without horses and so on today</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">then we</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">we run into these barriers of of of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">natural world</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">the environmental barriers and then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">climate change and all the rest</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">of it and then we&#39;re together waking up</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">okay we have environmental systemic</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">barriers that are going to stop us</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">from thriving and continuing</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">at the same time there&#39;s no reason to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">believe those barriers are</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">only environmental there are just as</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">much cognitive mental</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">uh well they have to do with with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">deep code of society and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:15.760" style="s2">and the culture we live in so the shift</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">and if modern society was the society</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.760" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">which could</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">see nature and then according to its</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">cultural code</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">change nature until poof this happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">and here i am in a house where</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">everything is produced from</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">places around the world and it&#39;s plastic</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s concrete and it&#39;s wood</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">and and silicon for that matter and all</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">of these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">put together according to some some</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">that that run our societies well</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">the next step would be to see those</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">principles of our societies</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">and make them visible and start taking</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">them as an</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">object of change as an object of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:55.200" style="s2">awareness so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">a core definition of a meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">society a society that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">and looks through modern society</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">and in which the the if</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">modern society before used to be a box</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">taken for</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">for granted now we can look inside the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">box we can see all of his constituent</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">elements we can see</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">uh how its norms are formed how how</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">people&#39;s selves develop sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">develop how</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">psychology is develop how interactions</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">are shaped through</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">everything from architecture to uh to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">interior design to institutions to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">language and so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">and we start reworking nature so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">becomes kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">one of those strange loop things yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">we&#39;re changing the code that modifies</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">our self which we use to modify our code</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">yeah and i mean and it&#39;s high time we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">it i mean uh so so douglas hofstadter</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">wrote this i am a strange loop and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">society in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">must become a strange loop that we we</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">have to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">the code that we ourselves are going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">run on</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">so yes i am a robot no i have no free</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">will or maybe i do in some philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">deep last instance but i am going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">follow the structures of language and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">grammar given to handed to me by</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">all the rest of you all i&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">i and if i try to do something else then</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">even then i will be structured uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">by by my environment so let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">grasp that deep environment and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">restructure it</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a humongous task i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s tremendous in its immensity</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">how how do we even start doing so and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">just to say something about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">important it is that we start evolving</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">in that direction now</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">and this speaks to another another</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">contemporary author uh max</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">tegmark this uh this futurist and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">physicist</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">he writes in in life 3.0 that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">okay now we&#39;re reaching the point where</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:07.119" style="s2">we&#39;re actually going to design</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">intelligent computers uh it&#39;s one part</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.119" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">ai you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">you&#39;re into that a lot um but also we</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:16.320" style="s2">can redesign biological life</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">so these things taken together we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.320" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">right now we are going to re-make</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">biology itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">according to our cultural code so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">the potential for creating suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">is immense so unless the cultural code</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.839" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">becomes self-aware and starts operating</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">and upon itself in a feedback cycle</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:41.440" style="s2">improving upon itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">not least to to you know get more</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.440" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">complex ethics to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">to update its the coded runs on to to</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.400" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">then we can create suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">as it has never been seen before so</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">these are very very very serious matters</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">um at this particular historical or i</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">suppose you could even say</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">trans-historical time because we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">of jumping off</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">one one axis of historical development</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">and uh going in a completely other</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s we&#39;re entering some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">post-human</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">history which is isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">continuous</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">with uh with the history of humanity as</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">we have conventionally thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">yep and i would add another endorsement</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">for life 3.0 a truly</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">mind-expanding book by max tegmark well</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">worth reading</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">let me propose sort of the classic</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">against you know this idea that we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">to intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">develop our social operating system</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">the classic kickback and i hear it all</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">the time when i talk about these things</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">when we talk about game b is oh isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">that social engineering</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">and you know what kind of hubris is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">to think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">consciously engineer our society i</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">should also add those</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">people who i disagree with i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">endorsing this view but i hear it all</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">and didn&#39;t social engineering the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">that we can do better</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:13.760" style="s2">lead us to nightmares like nazism and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">marxist leninism</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">right so first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s correct uh social engineering is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">but that something is dangerous distance</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">powerful and then you have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">right uh so</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">if if social engineering brought us</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">marxism and leninism it also brought us</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.839" style="s2">the us constitution</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">and and the basis of democracy and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.839" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">tripartite division of powers</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">people came up with this stuff uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">montesco came up with it uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">quite specifically and and some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">work then to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">uh institute these things as as</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">technologies as uh as engineer devices</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">there is always and has always been an</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">interplay between</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">the chance and what we cannot control</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">and the stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">we can control and canon should try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">and then the the the right balance is</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">difficult to know but you have to then</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">explore what the right balance is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">the the neoliberal idea uh would be that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">the markets is spontaneously organized</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">and then the state</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">is well basically control freak</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">mechanism by which human beings steer</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">and and and control and and suffocate</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">human creativity and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t actually make sense why</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">would agency</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">when controlled through the state be</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">inherently</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">oppressive and why would markets then be</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">inherent</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:45.560" style="s2">and on all the human agency that happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">through them be inherently</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.560" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">self-organizational obviously both</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:52.079" style="s2">things can be both oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">and self-organizational and no states</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.079" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">exist without</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">corresponding markets and no markets</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">actually exist without corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">the same goes for the third dimension a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">civil society</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">such as you and me having this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">discussion without it actually being</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">either a market or a state-defined</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">relationship in any way so um</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">i mean these these three things develop</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">um and the the idea is so and there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">no real</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">clear really clear um</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">distinction between what is engineering</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:29.040" style="s2">and what is just participation</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">and having an opinion and wanting to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.040" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">so the the reductio ad absurdum</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">i mean if you if you take it to its</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">extreme the position i am against social</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">engineering it also means you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">clean your kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">because hey who are you to say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">the dustbin should be underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">sink and if you try to control it then</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">bad things are going to come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">obviously then if you&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">control everything anything you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t you literally can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">out of bed</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">uh so so it&#39;s it it&#39;s not bad to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">a natural want for power in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">uh power as creativity as</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">participation as a freedom and my</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">freedom doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">stop at my outer border and begin at</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">your outer border it&#39;s actually i become</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">more free if you scaffold me by playing</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">things back to me right uh or by by</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">resonating with me and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">on it&#39;s it&#39;s actually a zero</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not a real question uh the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">thing about social engineering or not</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a real concern and the concern</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">if we can specify what i think people</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">really mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">do you think that you as an elite</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">should force your opinion on others if</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">you know it better through the monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">of violence of the state for instance</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">and then the answer is going to be no</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">and sometimes yes in extreme cases for</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">instance on</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">let&#39;s say criminality it makes sense for</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">us to you to have monopolies of violence</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">but in most cases we should go as</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">liberal and lenient</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">as possible yes it makes sense to put</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">breivik the terrorists who shot a shot</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">up 100 people</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">in jail against his will it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">and that we should do it by police force</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">but uh well and then if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">really really kill the anti social</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">engineering</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:33.359" style="s2">argument the the last and final</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">one is well okay we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.359" end="00:41:38.640" style="s2">schooling and schooling includes</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">to understand the epistemological limits</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">of complex systems the whole idea of</p>

<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">i think you and i would both agree in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">fact you use the term in your book</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:43.839" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to cultivate better</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">and one of the things paradoxically we</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">know about emergencies is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">essentially impossible to predict from</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">and so i&#39;d suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">one should think about the warning about</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">social engineering to mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">thinking that you can predict more than</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">you really can about the unfolding of a</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">and be sure that you&#39;re always thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:11.839" style="s2">about interventions to steer the system</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">towards what we think to be a better</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.839" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">as a series of probes and tests that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">have to be</p>

<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">and then the other one which i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">to introduce into game b for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">reason some people don&#39;t like the term</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">is rather than to compel people to move</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">to a new system</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">we should seduce them to move to a new</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">the idea struck me when i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">about the collapse of marxist leninism</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">eastern europe you know the reason they</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">all wanted to get the hell out to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">the east germans</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">and the poles and the hungarians was</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">they were seduced by the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">were receiving tv and radio broadcasts</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">from the west and they saw</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">gosh you know our country is gray and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">grim and full of spies</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">and very few fun and interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">these other people seem like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">having a whole lot more fun</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">so literally the germans and the poles</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">and the hungarians were seduced</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">to adopt the liberal democratic</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">market-driven</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">state away from marxist leninism and if</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">have the epistemological modesty of</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">and the idea that people should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">seduced rather than compelled we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">avoid some of the dangers of social</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">engineering</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">yes uh i agreed and whenever uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">compelling by force is necessary then we</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">can be pretty sure we&#39;re working against</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">the attractor points yes a good example</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">would be the cool locks in</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">in the soviet union so they thought ah</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">the future of society is probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">collective uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">collective big collective farms uh which</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">been uh owned by i don&#39;t know abstract</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">level by the state and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">and then why do these uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">middle class farmers don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">uh we have to force them and then they</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">end up killing a lot of kulaks and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">sending them to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">gulag and so on and of course if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">have to do that then</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">probably the behavioral forces</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">are not working in your directions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">you should try to work with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">behavioral forces right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:18.640" style="s2">whereas if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">some kind of future post-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">would have to out-compete capitalism on</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">its own terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">yep and i love that fact from your book</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">and again it&#39;s very much game b</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">that if we&#39;re really doing this right we</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">out-compete and then seduce people away</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">from the status quo if that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">another major theme at least what i took</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">to be a major theme</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">maybe the second biggest major theme of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">your book</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">this is a quote from the book the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">emotional well-being of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">is just as important as their economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">welfare</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">this would be a society where depression</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">stress and alienation</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">have become political issues in the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">vein as security</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">jobs and housing are today</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">yes uh so uh that&#39;s an important theme</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">that we can just make one topic</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">in politics and we would cover all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">those issues</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">because they&#39;re not i mean the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">complex and the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">intimate issues we we grapple with and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">i guess we&#39;ll get there later in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">interview when we talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">six dimensions of uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">politics i i suggest and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">the reason we don&#39;t already have these</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">as political topics</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">is that they are inherently difficult uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:40.839" style="s2">inherently difficult they&#39;re inherently</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">even for the individual like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">you know you find yourself in life and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">you ask yourself am i happy this is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">is this working out and during the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">you can have wildly different</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">interpretations well there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">nagging doubt</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">and actually i&#39;ve always known that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">then you can see</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:08.640" style="s2">a bit later no actually these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">work out in this way and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s all been part of a bigger narrative</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">i&#39;m going to in this direction and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:17.920" style="s2">learning and i&#39;m growing and i&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">i mean the more subtle stuff we we pick</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">up on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">the more difficult it is to make a</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">commitment to describing it to uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">do something about it and but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">it&#39;s still the most that subtle stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">on the inside of it each of us is still</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">what makes life worth</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">living and still what life is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">about it&#39;s not about a dollar baseline</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">or or an unemployment rate or something</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">else it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">what it is to be alive and what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">like and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">where we find meaning if we have love if</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">happy if we sleep well if there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">beauty in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">all that stuff so how can we somehow</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">rein those things into collective</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">consciousness and then make sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">that i mean we can&#39;t control them hey</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:13.599" style="s2">life happens like you said and we you</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t order somebody to be happy or</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">give them a friend</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">by the way by means of the welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:22.640" style="s2">or where whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">but you can create generative conditions</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.640" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">you can create good soil and bad soil</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">you can sow good seeds and bad seeds</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">and there are likelihoods here which</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">are empirically knowable and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">likelihoods might</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">be complex so you do let&#39;s say let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">intervention a and it creates these 20</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">great consequences</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">only they&#39;re just visible after 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">plus they create</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">three really bad consequences which are</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">visible already after three years</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">for instance i mean there are many such</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">difficult things to measure or see</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">but the fact that they&#39;re difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">measure or see</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re more in a sense qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">i&#39;m doing quotation marks here</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:10.800" style="s2">on qualitative that they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">qualitative doesn&#39;t make them</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.800" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">any less real or any less important</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">rather of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">and everybody knows this i suppose those</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">subtle things</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">are the most important things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">somehow then we</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">are basing our whole economic and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">political systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">on things that are i mean quite</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">obviously not the most important</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">things in life so it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">very good extension and you know you and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">i have talked about the facts i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">pretty hardcore scientific realist</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">but i&#39;ve also studied enough cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">science and cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">to know that the subjective is not only</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s more real than anything else to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">us ourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:52.720" style="s2">right and so it is odd that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">have somehow</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.720" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">in at least modern society drawn a band</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">around the subjective state and said</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not the government&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">basically particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">anglo-saxon sphere i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">again when i talk about these ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">working-class rural americans they say</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">what kind of economy is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">right but in reality it&#39;s the most real</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">thing to us</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">are we happy in and of ourself are we</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">do we feel rich in our relationships etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">and you know i agree with you that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">seems a natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">next step for what a social operating</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">system is</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.839" end="00:50:30.480" style="s2">getting a little short on time here</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">let&#39;s move along a little bit to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">how we do this</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">and some of the important ideas one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">important ideas which i resonated with</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">strongly is your concept of attractor</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">and that winning the game is getting the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.000" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">attractor points</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">right could you talk about that a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">yes so</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">um the attractor points well it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">complex systems right</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">if you study the many different states a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">system can</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">can enter into and you know this better</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">than i there</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">tend to be certain very likely outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">after you&#39;ve done many enough iterations</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">it tends to stabilize around a certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">around a certain point and and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">certain point tends to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">be describable and have certain space or</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">certain properties in this in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">so an example would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">for societal systems there appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:30.079" style="s2">such things as</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">chiefdoms this is described very well in</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.079" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">robert wright&#39;s writing or in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">francis fukuyama&#39;s writings or element</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">service that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">anthropologists and they describe</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">that once societies have a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">of abundance doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">necessarily have to have agriculture it</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">can be horticultural and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">just a rich hunter-gatherer society such</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">as the northwest</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">of of uh pre-columbian america</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">they tend to stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">around something called chiefdom&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">chiefdoms namely that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">many villages will have one and the same</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">in so many different times but under</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">corresponding circumstances yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">an attractor point</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">and in that sense it does that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:04.640" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">that teleologically reality or god wants</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">us to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">evolve in this direction or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">like that it just says that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">hey given these these settings and given</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">enough time</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">and given this dynamics ongoing this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">highly likely to occur but it might also</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">not occur something</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">something else can happen uh you can get</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">hit by a comet or whatever and then it</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">i hold them that attractor points</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">are real also in our time and in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">another simple example somebody invented</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">electricity and light bulbs a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">and today the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">over the whole human world with some few</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">small exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">is electrified and it has electric light</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">and why is that well because it was an</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">attractor point that once this existed</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:03.119" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t roll back it wouldn&#39;t cease</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">to to exist or appear and likewise the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.119" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">internet is a strong attractive point</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">and then the proliferation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">importance of the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">today the average person spends</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">a good spite of seven hours in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">online interactions of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s an incredibly strong attractive</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.319" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">so knowing such points</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.319" end="00:54:31.760" style="s2">in directionalities well that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">let us predict the future i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.760" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make us into mediums</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">but it helps it helps to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">to at least rule out some</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">ways of thinking and acting in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">and it makes us</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">more open to other ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">acting in the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">so my my suggestion is that people</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">should try to train our ability of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">a basic futurism or basic futurology</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">and try to see highly likely attractor</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">and not visual thinking or utopias or</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">that we wish or or dystopian scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">but just things that are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.599" style="s2">and if you see those attractor points</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">relatively well and see how they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.599" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:22.240" style="s2">from the society of today then</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">when you maneuver through life through</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.240" end="00:55:27.040" style="s2">business through the arts</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">through academia and research through</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.040" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">administration organization</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">uh and politics of course then on</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">average and over time</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">you will end up in a better place in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">labyrinth because you&#39;ll have hints</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">of where to go take a left or right to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:44.079" style="s2">go left or right</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">go straight forward and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:47.680" style="s2">if you have those hints those north</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">stars then</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.680" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">more people on average will walk</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">in unison or in parallel or in</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">alignment towards some kind of shared</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">common goal</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s shared my mind would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">what i call a more meta-modern society</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.240" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.520" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">yeah can you get explicit about maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">what some of these attractor points</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">might be or what a system of attractor</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">points</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">what comes next you know in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">world we often talk about basins of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">attraction which are</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">multiple dimensions of attractors</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:23.359" style="s2">operating to produce a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">container which is a dynamic social</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">you know maybe some ideas you have about</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">what metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">and its attractor points look like for</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">me this is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.520" style="s2">somewhat of a prequel to to the main</p>

<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">feel are are they have to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">a lot with technology with the</p>

<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a good way to think about it i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">like to make one other point about</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">attractors which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">in complex systems we talk about</p>

<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">all and i think one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">things about those of us thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">steering the world towards a better form</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">of what comes next</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">there are also some bad attractor points</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:30.880" style="s2">out there if we look</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">at history feudalism which i am now</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.880" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">calling neo-feudalism as the extreme</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">form of libertarianism</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">is certainly an attractor a neo-dark</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">ages where religious fundamentalists</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">somehow defeat</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">us all and we fall back into a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">years worth of superstition</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">perhaps the most dangerous is</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">neo-fascism and the chinese model kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">i could see the world falling into that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">so when we think about attractor points</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.839" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">and we can think about these good</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">attractors or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">attractors that we think lead to more</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">beneficial what comes next</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s real important to realize</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">that we&#39;re essentially fighting a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">strategic battle against</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">the marble falling into one of these bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:16.160" style="s2">basins of attraction</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">yes um i i mean i couldn&#39;t agree more</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.160" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">jim and uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">and you mentioned actually my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">bad attractor</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">i mean of course there there are there</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">i suppose there there&#39;s one good</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">attractor point and there are two</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">bad attractor points if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">these collective basins</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:36.160" style="s2">so one really bad attractor point uh or</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">attractive basin would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.160" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">some kind of fragmentation of the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">system basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">it falls apart we fail to uphold</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">the flows of good services and energy</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">and information</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">and then we start dying and we start</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">killing each other would be really bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">and i suppose that&#39;s the most sinister</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:59.119" style="s2">one but almost as sinister in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">more nightmarish is global dictatorship</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.119" end="01:02:04.880" style="s2">attractor point uh which um</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">this this is an argument made by yuval</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.880" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">harari very very</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">well made that capitalism could</p>

<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">because it had decentralized</p>

<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">inadvertently it also meant that</p>

<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">could out-compete authoritarianism in</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">that same age</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:34.160" style="s2">uh because uh it just</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">decentralized all of those decisions and</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.160" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">all the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:39.520" style="s2">economic organization into all of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">different businesses which then competed</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.520" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:44.480" style="s2">each of them had the incentives to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">the best decisions as if their</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.480" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">businesses depended on</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">upon it as if their lives depended upon</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">it and then in the end they</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:53.440" style="s2">they processed more information more</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:56.480" style="s2">sensitively and more productively</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.440" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">and they evolved better um</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.480" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">so that so that the whole system as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">whole was much more</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">resilient and much more open to change</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:06.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">much more highly developmental and so on</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.240" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">so people coordinated their agency</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">what harare mentioned is that well what</p>

<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">we&#39;re reaching the point today where you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.039" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">can actually gather enough data</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">about people to control their agency</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">and have enough algorithms that are</p>

<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.720" style="s2">the authoritarian one is that you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.720" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">but at least you&#39;re ordered when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">and safe setting you can imagine then</p>

<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">modern world order would be one of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.599" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">deeper democracy which still manages to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">coordinate us on a global level so it</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">would be ordered and free</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">i suppose that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:52.880" style="s2">a good way to think about it let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">briefly about another i thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.880" end="01:05:56.079" style="s2">very important concept which again i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">started to use and encourage other</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.079" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">people to use</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">which is as we think about tactics how</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:02.960" style="s2">we actually go from where we are to</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.039" style="s2">where we want to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">you talk about the ideas of game</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.039" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">acceptance game denial</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:11.920" style="s2">and game change a little bit of detail</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:15.280" style="s2">on each of those would be great</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.920" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">yes sure so roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.280" end="01:06:19.039" style="s2">most people are stuck in either game</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">denial or game acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.039" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">and game denial is all the idealistic</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:26.400" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s uh most of all the sin of uh of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.400" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">of the left i suppose and game denial</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.760" end="01:06:34.880" style="s2">is basically that you want to somehow</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a utopian impulse that you want</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.880" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">to remove</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.480" end="01:06:41.119" style="s2">unfairness and reality and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to move towards a place</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.119" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">where competition would be abolished</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">where people would just be kind and</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">actually i see</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">some of this even in in game b</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">formulations i i get a bit of game</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:56.920" style="s2">denial vibes when</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">they say we want to move into a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.920" end="01:07:02.400" style="s2">non-rivalrous game or</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">a non-competitive game and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:06.000" style="s2">currently in a rivalrous game or</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:09.480" style="s2">rivalrous civilization</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.000" end="01:07:12.960" style="s2">and that includes a number of logical</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.480" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">impossibilities i mean things can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.960" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">several things at once maybe at a</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">quantum level but for instance</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">any time there is a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:24.720" style="s2">there is also a power relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">that power relationship</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.720" end="01:07:31.760" style="s2">is always dependent on some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">properties or strengths of the involved</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">even down to you know parent child stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">or lovers or partners or</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">certainly humans and animals it just</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">it just goes through all of it so so</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">to reach that point that ultimate point</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">no competition and for this reason</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily the best goal and</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">what happens is in great</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:00.079" style="s2">practice this has very practical</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">implications if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.079" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">left parties around europe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">have these in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.240" end="01:08:07.599" style="s2">in the us but you have i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:10.480" style="s2">campus</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.599" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">radicalism and and left idealism of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.480" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">different kinds</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.839" end="01:08:14.960" style="s2">if you look at these policies that they</p>

<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">in all seriousness suggest and that they</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">would implement if they were</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:23.120" style="s2">to given the reins of power of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:24.880" style="s2">government in european countries they</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.120" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">would open the borders</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.880" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">they would lower uh order and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">and crime delinquency</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">uh justice system stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">and they would raise the subsidies to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">normal people and and they would secure</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">your jobs more and make it harder to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:49.440" style="s2">kick people from from their work or</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">to sac people and they would increase</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.440" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">the environmental regulations and other</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">companies and what would happen in</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:59.520" style="s2">reality is not that</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">left utopia would emerge rather the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.520" end="01:09:03.120" style="s2">countries would be</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">swamped with immigration they would eat</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">immigrants would be paid a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:10.319" style="s2">subsidy money at the same time this</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">would cause great costs</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">to the tax system and businesses and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:17.120" style="s2">businesses would</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">dwindle and they would be out competed</p>

<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">and people would actually be stuck in</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">in their jobs and not be sacked so that</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">the low movement of the labor</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">would mean that you had a very high</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">unemployment at the very same time</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">so that the whole system would collapse</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">in a matter of 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:40.799" style="s2">that&#39;s what would actually happen if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:43.520" style="s2">did all of these idealist things</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s in game denial you&#39;re denying</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.520" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">there are games that there are choices</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">that have to be made</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:09:56.719" style="s2">moving from there to game acceptance</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.719" end="01:10:00.960" style="s2">just the opposite so a fascist will or</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.920" end="01:10:03.199" style="s2">or a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.960" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">they will tend to think well life is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.199" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">tough</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">if it wasn&#39;t fair to you tough your</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">you work it out and then in the long run</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.960" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be fair either way if</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:15.280" style="s2">everybody just plays the game and some</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">people are going to be rich</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.280" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">others are going to be poor and what</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">they end up doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.560" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">is conversely defending all sorts of</p>

<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:27.840" style="s2">that actually are quite malleable</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.360" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">and quite changeable and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.840" end="01:10:31.920" style="s2">necessarily have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">be that way and you can go back through</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.920" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">so conservatives were against universal</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:39.360" style="s2">suffrage they were against the ovulation</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">of slavery they were against</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.360" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">well pretty much anything reasonable and</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">good that you can think of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">that was brought on by radical politics</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">in all of these steps they would always</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:51.600" style="s2">argue that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be possible it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.600" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">to change it&#39;s actually fair</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:56.719" style="s2">they were arguing according to game</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:10:59.199" style="s2">acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.719" end="01:11:00.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you have today as well</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.199" end="01:11:02.719" style="s2">so game change</p>

<p begin="01:11:02.719" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">two things she kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">met a modern good bass and would be the</p>

<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">fragmentation and and authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">or digital authoritarianism then you</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">take the positive sides of both those</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.520" end="01:11:18.640" style="s2">things and you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">where you want to go so the positive</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.640" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">side of of game</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">denial is that you refuse to accept</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">injustices that are arbitrary and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:30.880" style="s2">can be changed</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:31.679" style="s2">you say that okay the game that exists</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.880" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.679" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">is not good enough it&#39;s not treating</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:36.640" style="s2">people well it&#39;s not treating animals</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.640" end="01:11:41.520" style="s2">justifiable and if you look at the game</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:44.400" style="s2">acceptance part</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.520" end="01:11:46.080" style="s2">you say but the game is there there is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.400" end="01:11:46.960" style="s2">game there always has been there always</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.080" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.960" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">so what&#39;s the conclusion you work</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:56.960" style="s2">to learn the game play it lovingly</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">understand its rules and work to change</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.960" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">it you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">change the rules of the game and this</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:02.640" style="s2">has happened throughout history so it</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">can happen again</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.640" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">the the lives that we live in</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:12.320" style="s2">modern let&#39;s say sweden and</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">the us is considerably different from</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.320" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what it might have been in</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:19.040" style="s2">mamluk egypt</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">in the 12th century it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.040" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">quite different and the games of life</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">uh the stakes we played for it if we</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">insulted the king back then</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">or the sultan we would um literally</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:36.960" style="s2">be tortured and killed so we we played</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">on a different game board and a society</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.960" end="01:12:42.000" style="s2">was ruled by a slave army</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">so you could actually only advance by</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.000" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">joint by being kidnapped as a young kid</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">and then advance by by battling where we</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">whereas we can advance</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">by uh i don&#39;t know uh inventing</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">something nice and starting a nighty</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:12:58.960" style="s2">for instance so the games are quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.679" end="01:13:01.120" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.960" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">but they&#39;re still games and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.120" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">still winners and losers and there</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:07.040" style="s2">always will be</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful i found that an</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.040" end="01:13:10.560" style="s2">extraordinarily useful perspective and i</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:11.679" style="s2">would encourage other people to</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.560" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">when they read the book to get their</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.679" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">head around those three things and</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:17.840" style="s2">try to keep your head in the game change</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:18.560" style="s2">space and not fall into either of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.840" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">other two</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.560" end="01:13:22.719" style="s2">basins now we&#39;re going to turn to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">heart of the matter at least in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.719" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">the heart of the matter with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">how do we actually do this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">and that is what you called your master</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:32.560" style="s2">pattern six parts</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:34.239" style="s2">of different kinds of politics that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">interoperate together</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.239" end="01:13:38.719" style="s2">and that you argue can if executed well</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:41.840" style="s2">move us towards a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.719" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">relative utopia so i&#39;d like you to start</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.840" end="01:13:46.239" style="s2">first briefly defining what you meant by</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">relative utopia and then take us through</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.239" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">the six parts</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">and to the degree we have time how they</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">inter-operate</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">to move us towards a relative utopia</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">right so thank you for asking and i mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:13:59.840" style="s2">i just</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:01.280" style="s2">recently came across this other term</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.840" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">protopia</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.280" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">um something somebody also suggested the</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.080" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">the word</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:08.080" style="s2">utopia with the eu the good place rather</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.080" end="01:14:12.320" style="s2">utopias and the nowhere place but of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">course it&#39;s a play on words</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.320" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">back in thomas morris uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:18.960" style="s2">initial initial formulation in the in</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">the 16th century</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.960" end="01:14:22.239" style="s2">he wrote about utopia which was a play</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">on words with about</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the place that doesn&#39;t exist and</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.480" end="01:14:29.920" style="s2">the good place</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:32.719" style="s2">protopia then is another term for</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.920" end="01:14:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not then a utopian static vision</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.719" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.280" end="01:14:37.199" style="s2">what society can and should be like and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:40.640" style="s2">then everybody will be happy</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.199" end="01:14:43.760" style="s2">rather it&#39;s a relative place which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.640" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">obviously preferable for most people</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">than the current state of affairs so</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:50.080" style="s2">protopia is</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">just somewhere you want to move but</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.080" end="01:14:53.120" style="s2">which is still</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:54.080" style="s2">qualitatively different from where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.120" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">at today</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.080" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s also what i mean with with</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">the relative utopia</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:02.000" style="s2">uh vision there are there are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">different authors today uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.000" end="01:15:06.800" style="s2">who have brought up visions of relative</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:10.400" style="s2">utopia there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.800" end="01:15:13.440" style="s2">dutch historian um who wrote it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.400" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">utopia for realist right his book and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.440" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">basic income and open borders i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:21.120" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">actually his his program uh or</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">or the argument made in his book but</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:27.360" style="s2">he&#39;s playing around</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:28.159" style="s2">with the very fact that from the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.360" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.159" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">of 200 years ago what we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:35.760" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:37.440" style="s2">is a utopia in many ways</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.760" end="01:15:39.760" style="s2">of course not everybody&#39;s happy and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.440" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">there are all sorts of horrible things</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.760" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">but just if you if you take the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:46.480" style="s2">average</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:49.040" style="s2">experience of everyday life and ex</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.480" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">of a middle-class person today versus a</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.040" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">farmer in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">in the early 1800s then the difference</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:58.960" style="s2">unimaginable and it does and if we we</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.199" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">describe what we had for dinner</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.960" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">and which parts of the world we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:04.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">and what kind of privileges we have and</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:09.520" style="s2">so on it would sound utopian</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:10.640" style="s2">and in that sense we&#39;re in a relative</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.199" end="01:16:20.719" style="s2">if that has happened again and again</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.199" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">throughout history that</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.719" end="01:16:24.320" style="s2">we have created relative utopias and</p>

<p begin="01:16:24.320" end="01:16:28.880" style="s2">with the advent of modernity would it be</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.760" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">so strange</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.880" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">if in 200 years society will look like a</p>

<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">to us and that it would be qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.679" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:43.840" style="s2">in ways that we almost can&#39;t imagine</p>

<p begin="01:16:55.360" end="01:17:01.760" style="s2">us to gulag</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.440" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">when we know that is what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.760" end="01:17:07.199" style="s2">relative utopia at least so how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">it let&#39;s talk about the master pattern</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.199" end="01:17:09.600" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:11.360" style="s2">six kinds of politics that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.600" end="01:17:14.239" style="s2">master</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.360" end="01:17:15.360" style="s2">oh yeah so so that&#39;s the biggest part of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.239" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">the book and then the</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.360" end="01:17:18.480" style="s2">the biggest part of the argument i</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:21.520" style="s2">suppose um the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">the first part is to see that</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.520" end="01:17:27.440" style="s2">politics and what we mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:28.239" style="s2">by the word politics changes over time</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.440" end="01:17:30.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.239" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">all of the basics were there already in</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.640" end="01:17:35.440" style="s2">sumerian civilization for instance that</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.880" style="s2">well you would have um you would have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.440" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2">minister of war you would have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.880" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">minister of</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">taxes you would have a minister of</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:43.360" style="s2">education and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.760" end="01:17:44.880" style="s2">and then of course somebody would be</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.360" end="01:17:47.440" style="s2">something like a prime minister</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.880" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">and then of course in in the sumerian</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.440" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">society you had a</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">you had a king or a god king something</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">throughout the development of more and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">more complex societies</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:18:01.679" style="s2">more roles have been taken up by society</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">so i mean in babylon you had the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.679" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">organization of</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:10.400" style="s2">municipal brothels for instance</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:13.600" style="s2">and whereas in rome you had</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.400" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">well you had all of the the building of</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.600" end="01:18:17.920" style="s2">aqueducts and and all sorts of of public</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">things that had to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.920" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">with the colosseums and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">amphitheaters and</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:26.159" style="s2">many different things that that evolve</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.159" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">which the public realm take up something</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:34.800" style="s2">and and begin to develop techniques and</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:37.040" style="s2">experiences shared experiences</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:38.080" style="s2">for dealing with something that formally</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:40.310" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">viewed as part of politics</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.310" end="01:18:43.520" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:45.520" style="s2">and this is difficult and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.520" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">controversial because it&#39;s i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.520" end="01:18:48.640" style="s2">how far should politics expand it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:50.640" style="s2">it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.640" end="01:18:52.800" style="s2">and how far can can it realistically</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.640" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">expand what we see though is that there</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.800" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">is a direction of</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:59.840" style="s2">a developmental direction here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:02.800" style="s2">not necessarily in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.840" end="01:19:03.600" style="s2">more control of every each and every</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:07.040" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.600" end="01:19:09.760" style="s2">but it is in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.040" end="01:19:10.719" style="s2">somehow organizing and coordinating on</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.760" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">more and more</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.719" end="01:19:18.480" style="s2">domains of life the last</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">large example of such a major shift is</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.480" end="01:19:26.560" style="s2">probably environmental politics so</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">back in the 1800s u.s government</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.560" end="01:19:30.400" style="s2">created something like uh the ministry</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:34.000" style="s2">of forestry and</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.400" end="01:19:35.600" style="s2">and and not it wasn&#39;t called the</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.000" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">environmental ministry at that point</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.600" end="01:19:41.679" style="s2">but from now a hundred years after that</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.719" end="01:19:43.120" style="s2">almost all countries had some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:46.400" style="s2">environmental</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:50.239" style="s2">ministry or department dealing</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.400" end="01:19:52.880" style="s2">with environmental issues now</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.239" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">what we have seen a tendency towards and</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.880" end="01:19:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s very tentative and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:19:59.920" style="s2">it just flickers past here and there</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.920" end="01:20:00.800" style="s2">there is a minister of loneliness in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.920" end="01:20:04.800" style="s2">uk</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.800" end="01:20:07.440" style="s2">there was a minister of the future in um</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.800" end="01:20:08.800" style="s2">in sweden there was a minister of</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:10.239" style="s2">happiness in some country i keep</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.800" end="01:20:13.760" style="s2">forgetting which one</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.239" end="01:20:14.159" style="s2">bhutan well perhaps in bhutan i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.760" end="01:20:17.040" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.159" end="01:20:18.239" style="s2">uh so in bhutan of course there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.040" end="01:20:20.080" style="s2">gdp</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.239" end="01:20:22.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the gross national happiness</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.080" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">thing and and all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.080" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">uh maybe there is also minister of</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.600" end="01:20:26.480" style="s2">happiness there but they&#39;re a minister</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:28.719" style="s2">of yoga in in</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.480" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">current uh current india perhaps not the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.719" end="01:20:32.480" style="s2">most progressive food</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.000" end="01:20:33.360" style="s2">in the world but if you take these</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.480" end="01:20:36.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.360" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">um they point</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.400" end="01:20:39.679" style="s2">uh these two different tendencies they</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:42.800" style="s2">point towards</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.679" end="01:20:45.440" style="s2">somehow that politics wants to deal</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.800" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">with issues of mental health of personal</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.440" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:50.880" style="s2">of human relationships of inner</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:52.800" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.880" end="01:20:54.400" style="s2">which we talked about earlier in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.800" end="01:20:56.719" style="s2">interview right</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.400" end="01:20:57.600" style="s2">and as we also mentioned these things</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.719" end="01:21:00.480" style="s2">are difficult</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.600" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">to grasp these things are difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.480" end="01:21:05.040" style="s2">corner</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:09.120" style="s2">and clearly get our hands on as objects</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.040" end="01:21:11.600" style="s2">and for this reason we may need several</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.120" end="01:21:12.480" style="s2">forms of new politics which balance each</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.600" end="01:21:15.040" style="s2">other out</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.480" end="01:21:16.960" style="s2">and take different dimensions of what it</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.040" end="01:21:17.840" style="s2">means to organize as human beings in</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:19.440" style="s2">societies</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.840" end="01:21:20.880" style="s2">and what it means to be a human being in</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.440" end="01:21:24.880" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.880" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">and let these evolve together</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.880" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">so that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:34.159" style="s2">they can they can triangulate or</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:34.880" style="s2">with more angles and three really uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.159" end="01:21:37.360" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:38.000" style="s2">more complex and subtle issues of life</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.360" end="01:21:40.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.000" end="01:21:41.760" style="s2">somehow make put them at the heart and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.080" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">center of how we organize</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.760" end="01:21:47.920" style="s2">our societies so to</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:49.040" style="s2">to mention uh some of these forms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.920" end="01:21:52.639" style="s2">politics which</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.040" end="01:21:53.760" style="s2">i suggest one would be existential</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.639" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.760" end="01:21:59.679" style="s2">meaning politics of</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:01.280" style="s2">looking into how meaningful people find</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.679" end="01:22:04.880" style="s2">their lives and</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.280" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">how purpose-driven people&#39;s lives are</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.880" end="01:22:09.520" style="s2">and how free we really feel</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:10.320" style="s2">on the inside whether or not we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.520" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">struggle with</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.320" end="01:22:18.080" style="s2">issues of death and anxiety and so on</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:20.239" style="s2">and see if well what can</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.080" end="01:22:22.400" style="s2">possibly be done here in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.239" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">education in terms of health care</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.400" end="01:22:27.360" style="s2">in terms of preventive measures it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:27.920" style="s2">important issue like how are people</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:31.440" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.920" end="01:22:34.960" style="s2">really feeling deep down like</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.440" end="01:22:35.600" style="s2">are we living our lives to the fullest</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.960" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">or to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.600" end="01:22:40.080" style="s2">to the the best possible extent that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:42.719" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.080" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">and somehow that issue never shows up in</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.719" end="01:22:46.960" style="s2">politics because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">thought of as part of the personal realm</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.960" end="01:22:52.880" style="s2">and the private realm</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:54.560" style="s2">but quite obviously it depends upon</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.880" end="01:22:56.560" style="s2">other people and depends upon the social</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.560" end="01:22:59.920" style="s2">structures that we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.560" end="01:23:02.800" style="s2">so it should be perhaps made</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.920" end="01:23:03.679" style="s2">into a conscious and explicit form of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.800" end="01:23:06.000" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.679" end="01:23:06.719" style="s2">which would include its own censuses and</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.000" end="01:23:09.440" style="s2">so</p>

<p begin="01:23:57.120" end="01:24:02.239" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing all sorts of fallout of</p>

<p begin="01:24:12.800" end="01:24:16.880" style="s2">is a bit of a</p>

<p begin="01:24:16.880" end="01:24:20.719" style="s2">picked the german word because there</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.239" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an exact corresponding one in</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.719" end="01:24:24.880" style="s2">in english gemini means something like</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.880" end="01:24:29.360" style="s2">or relationship or fellowship in in the</p>

<p begin="01:24:29.360" end="01:24:35.760" style="s2">are togetherness i suppose you could say</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.639" end="01:24:38.560" style="s2">and somehow togetherness can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.760" end="01:24:40.000" style="s2">have higher or lower quality and it can</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.560" end="01:24:42.560" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.000" end="01:24:43.199" style="s2">more pervasive or less pervasive it can</p>

<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:50.239" style="s2">and problems or it can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">more pure and and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.239" end="01:24:56.639" style="s2">resonate in a more harmonic manner</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">so this is a very very very important</p>

<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:02.560" style="s2">much everybody&#39;s life</p>

<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:12.000" style="s2">of uh the budgeting of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.520" end="01:25:14.080" style="s2">our self-organization as as political</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.000" end="01:25:16.400" style="s2">units so we&#39;re just leaving it up to</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.080" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">chance really this most important part</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.400" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">of what it means to be human and again</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:24.239" style="s2">then creating a welfare state where you</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.080" end="01:25:25.520" style="s2">can go to the to the welfare office and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.239" end="01:25:26.719" style="s2">get a friend</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.520" end="01:25:28.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.719" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about generative</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.719" end="01:25:34.320" style="s2">conditions or</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:36.239" style="s2">whatever can nimbly and intelligently</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.320" end="01:25:37.520" style="s2">be made in terms of interventions or</p>

<p begin="01:25:37.520" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">or equipping people with the right</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.239" end="01:25:43.520" style="s2">skills and</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:45.920" style="s2">and the context and so on to get these</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.520" end="01:25:48.880" style="s2">things to work as well as possible</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.920" end="01:25:51.840" style="s2">and then of course refine what we mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.880" end="01:25:54.800" style="s2">by good relationships throughout society</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.840" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">so those are two dimensions um we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.800" end="01:25:59.679" style="s2">going to go through i suppose all six in</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">in the same detail but just to mention</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.679" end="01:26:02.159" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:03.199" style="s2">a couple of things about the other ones</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.159" end="01:26:07.120" style="s2">the other ones</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.199" end="01:26:09.600" style="s2">are try to balance these</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.120" end="01:26:11.920" style="s2">out because both of these things</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.600" end="01:26:14.320" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.920" end="01:26:16.000" style="s2">and what if what really feels like to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.320" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.000" end="01:26:21.440" style="s2">and and relationships they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.719" end="01:26:24.480" style="s2">very personal matters right</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.440" end="01:26:25.280" style="s2">and the very personal matters here uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.480" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.280" end="01:26:29.520" style="s2">they need to be balanced when when they</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.520" end="01:26:30.880" style="s2">become political they need to somehow be</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.520" end="01:26:34.320" style="s2">balanced out</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.880" end="01:26:37.520" style="s2">by issues that are um</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.320" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">that by politics that protect</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.520" end="01:26:44.320" style="s2">us from more subtle forms</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:46.080" style="s2">of transgression in these areas so</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.320" end="01:26:48.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why we might need something like</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.080" end="01:26:50.880" style="s2">emancipation politics</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.000" end="01:26:51.440" style="s2">like a politics which a kind of politics</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.880" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">with its</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.440" end="01:26:56.560" style="s2">own uh ministry and its own</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:26:58.000" style="s2">department which pushes and perhaps its</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.560" end="01:27:01.280" style="s2">own parties</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.000" end="01:27:02.800" style="s2">which pushes against these these more</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:06.000" style="s2">integrative processes</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.800" end="01:27:08.080" style="s2">these processes that have to do with uh</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.000" end="01:27:09.840" style="s2">with meddling with people&#39;s lives with</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.080" end="01:27:11.840" style="s2">the improving upon</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.840" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">relationships and going deeper into the</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.840" end="01:27:16.639" style="s2">personal emancipation politics</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:17.360" style="s2">politics of freedom of conflicts of</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.639" end="01:27:19.520" style="s2">protecting</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.360" end="01:27:20.960" style="s2">the individual&#39;s rights would push</p>

<p begin="01:27:20.960" end="01:27:25.600" style="s2">these other two from there on we might</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.239" end="01:27:29.199" style="s2">imagine a fourth</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.600" end="01:27:31.600" style="s2">kind of politics empirical politics</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.199" end="01:27:33.120" style="s2">meaning that each of these things need</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.600" end="01:27:34.800" style="s2">to be formulated in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.120" end="01:27:36.320" style="s2">actually make sense and actually have</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.800" end="01:27:39.760" style="s2">intended effects</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.320" end="01:27:41.679" style="s2">so society needs to become a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.760" end="01:27:44.800" style="s2">scientific than it currently is</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.679" end="01:27:45.280" style="s2">most of policy decision making today is</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.800" end="01:27:47.760" style="s2">based</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.280" end="01:27:48.480" style="s2">quite loosely on science and science can</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.760" end="01:27:51.280" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.480" end="01:27:52.159" style="s2">expanded and we can have much stronger</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.280" end="01:27:54.239" style="s2">knowledge about</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.159" end="01:27:56.000" style="s2">why we&#39;re doing things and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.239" end="01:27:58.800" style="s2">doing things</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.000" end="01:28:00.239" style="s2">so that would be a fourth dimension an</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.800" end="01:28:03.600" style="s2">empirical dimension</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.239" end="01:28:04.400" style="s2">which then is in a way third person</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.600" end="01:28:07.360" style="s2">reality or</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.400" end="01:28:08.159" style="s2">objective reality pushing back against</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.360" end="01:28:09.760" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.159" end="01:28:12.159" style="s2">things that come from the subjective</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.760" end="01:28:13.600" style="s2">realm so we get to know</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.159" end="01:28:16.239" style="s2">the inter-subjective realm or the</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.600" end="01:28:19.120" style="s2">objective realm and try to</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.239" end="01:28:21.040" style="s2">validate these more subtle forms of</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.120" end="01:28:23.920" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.040" end="01:28:24.639" style="s2">then this would bring us to a fifth one</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.920" end="01:28:28.159" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.639" end="01:28:31.440" style="s2">requires a deeper legitimacy which</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.159" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">requires a deepening of democracy so</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.440" end="01:28:36.080" style="s2">the kind of democracy that we have today</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:39.920" style="s2">is relatively representative and distant</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.080" end="01:28:40.320" style="s2">and bureaucratic if we are to enter into</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.920" end="01:28:43.120" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.320" end="01:28:44.560" style="s2">more intimate realms of human</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.560" end="01:28:49.679" style="s2">we must also in different ways deepen</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.520" end="01:28:52.080" style="s2">the legitimacy and participation</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.679" end="01:28:53.360" style="s2">and humanization of the democratic</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.080" end="01:28:56.400" style="s2">system and that is an</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.360" end="01:28:57.840" style="s2">ongoing process which may require its</p>

<p begin="01:28:57.840" end="01:29:02.639" style="s2">political impetus and perhaps its own</p>

<p begin="01:29:02.639" end="01:29:06.560" style="s2">and that should be an ongoing process</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.639" end="01:29:09.760" style="s2">maybe that society should</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.560" end="01:29:12.800" style="s2">invest a lot in this issue</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.760" end="01:29:16.000" style="s2">improving upon its own</p>

<p begin="01:29:22.159" end="01:29:26.960" style="s2">how science governs itself making it</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.719" end="01:29:27.679" style="s2">more transparent more participatory more</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.960" end="01:29:30.000" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.679" end="01:29:31.280" style="s2">in its decision making and making its</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.000" end="01:29:34.400" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.280" end="01:29:35.440" style="s2">more legitimate to the citizens more</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.400" end="01:29:38.080" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.440" end="01:29:39.440" style="s2">as their own which brings us to the last</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.080" end="01:29:41.040" style="s2">form of politics</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.440" end="01:29:42.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we started in this</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.040" end="01:29:45.840" style="s2">interview i suppose and</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.800" end="01:29:46.719" style="s2">a good place to uh to draw towards an</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.840" end="01:29:49.679" style="s2">end</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.719" end="01:29:50.560" style="s2">is that the the last form of politics</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.679" end="01:29:53.360" style="s2">the sixth form</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.560" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">would be politics of theory meaning a</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.360" end="01:29:56.960" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:29:59.040" style="s2">of how we describe reality and how we</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.960" end="01:29:59.520" style="s2">brainwash ourselves as society we said</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.040" end="01:30:01.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.520" end="01:30:02.800" style="s2">i said early on that a meta-modern</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.360" end="01:30:05.280" style="s2">society is different</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:07.679" style="s2">from a modern society in that modern</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.280" end="01:30:10.159" style="s2">society changes nature</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.679" end="01:30:11.600" style="s2">according to its cultural uh to its</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.159" end="01:30:13.440" style="s2">cultural code</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.600" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">but a meta-modern society must be able</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.440" end="01:30:17.360" style="s2">to see its own cultural code</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:19.760" style="s2">and change also what it means to be</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.360" end="01:30:23.199" style="s2">human and how the interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.760" end="01:30:25.360" style="s2">that are in in its culture uh affect</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.199" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">our our everyday life and agency and</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.360" end="01:30:30.000" style="s2">that everyday life itself</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:31.040" style="s2">can be different including how we view</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.000" end="01:30:34.719" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.040" end="01:30:36.960" style="s2">and our place in it so this in itself</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.719" end="01:30:39.199" style="s2">should become a political issue of</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.960" end="01:30:41.600" style="s2">course balanced by all of the others</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.199" end="01:30:42.800" style="s2">you need a strong empirical pushback</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.600" end="01:30:45.360" style="s2">here you need</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.800" end="01:30:46.320" style="s2">democratic participation in these kinds</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.360" end="01:30:49.360" style="s2">of processes</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.320" end="01:30:52.239" style="s2">but the the fundamental issue about what</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.360" end="01:30:53.280" style="s2">stories about reality do people have and</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.239" end="01:30:55.280" style="s2">how can those</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.280" end="01:30:56.560" style="s2">be improved upon and bridged in the best</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.280" end="01:30:59.199" style="s2">possible way</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.560" end="01:31:02.880" style="s2">is a question that has immense</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.199" end="01:31:05.600" style="s2">importance even to our very survival as</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.880" end="01:31:06.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the species and society and so on</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.600" end="01:31:10.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.239" end="01:31:13.440" style="s2">uh so we can&#39;t really avoid the issue</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.000" end="01:31:15.360" style="s2">what what reality what sense of reality</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.440" end="01:31:17.199" style="s2">do we have and that should be placed at</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.360" end="01:31:19.280" style="s2">the very heart of politics</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.199" end="01:31:21.360" style="s2">this shouldn&#39;t be the first step in</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.280" end="01:31:24.000" style="s2">introducing a meta-modern politics</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.360" end="01:31:26.159" style="s2">but these six forms of politics together</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.000" end="01:31:28.560" style="s2">they form</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.159" end="01:31:30.639" style="s2">a kind of master pattern that if you try</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.560" end="01:31:32.639" style="s2">to do one of them they won&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.639" end="01:31:34.000" style="s2">if you try to do two of them they might</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.639" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">balance out a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.000" end="01:31:37.760" style="s2">but if you do all six there is a logic</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:40.800" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.760" end="01:31:42.560" style="s2">that makes it makes them hopefully or as</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.800" end="01:31:46.080" style="s2">far as i can see</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.560" end="01:31:49.120" style="s2">balance out more and they should also be</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.080" end="01:31:51.440" style="s2">viewed as some being more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.120" end="01:31:53.520" style="s2">than others so the politics of theory is</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.440" end="01:31:55.440" style="s2">that in a sense the heaviest one but</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.520" end="01:31:56.560" style="s2">also the most difficult one that relies</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.440" end="01:32:00.159" style="s2">most upon</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.560" end="01:32:02.960" style="s2">the former ones well very good</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.159" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">i should really thank you for a very</p>
