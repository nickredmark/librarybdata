<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">I was listening to that announcement you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">made about the emerg podcast this</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:44.970" style="s2">morning actually just thinking about so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:47.870" style="s2">you saying that you&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.970" end="00:00:51.330" style="s2">direction a little bit perhaps for</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.870" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">exploring what was the phrase you used</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.330" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">say systems and systems transformation</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">with the grounding in say personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">development and then perhaps looking at</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:02.489" style="s2">it from the other direction like going</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:04.649" style="s2">more into actually personal development</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">in the context of the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.649" end="00:01:10.590" style="s2">going through systems change</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">I was running like maybe it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.590" end="00:01:16.340" style="s2">interesting topic to just explore first</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:18.899" style="s2">is like why this sense of a need for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.340" end="00:01:20.940" style="s2">personal development that say levelling</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.899" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">up humanity and how we express ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.940" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">as humans within this time and as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">said I don&#39;t know if you have with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">answers to that but I was important you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">got - sure sure with that yeah so why</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">why the focus on personal development or</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">personal change yeah well so one one</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">thing that I think I&#39;m really fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:45.150" style="s2">by and this is probably to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">my Buddhist training is that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.150" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">obvious to me and to many people that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:53.540" style="s2">there is this dichotomy between systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:56.220" style="s2">change and personal transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.540" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">yet I also have this thinking suspicion</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.220" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s a false dichotomy right that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">there actually it&#39;s like an artifact of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:07.650" style="s2">our misperception that we even separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">the two at all and in fact we can sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.650" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">of like acknowledge that this system</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">which I think that you and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:18.660" style="s2">agree is has some fundamental issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:20.790" style="s2">that we need to kind of work out with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">some degree of urgency you know because</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.790" end="00:02:29.060" style="s2">the biosphere isn&#39;t like waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:33.910" style="s2">unravel it&#39;s unraveling now that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.060" end="00:02:36.940" style="s2">that it the this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.910" end="00:02:39.160" style="s2">system that is currently the problem has</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.940" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">already been that which has constructed</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.160" end="00:02:47.380" style="s2">us so the mind that is attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:50.200" style="s2">find a way out is the very mind that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.380" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">built or the very human you know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.200" end="00:02:55.300" style="s2">was built by the system which is self</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:58.060" style="s2">terminating and so there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.300" end="00:03:01.660" style="s2">like like a recursive chicken and egg</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.060" end="00:03:04.930" style="s2">problem when we think about systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">change in personal development and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:09.220" style="s2">you know I in any case like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:12.070" style="s2">conversations I had in the podcast have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.220" end="00:03:14.980" style="s2">always been like looking in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.070" end="00:03:17.140" style="s2">refracting through a side but always</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.980" end="00:03:18.970" style="s2">acknowledging that you can&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.140" end="00:03:21.250" style="s2">one without the other that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.970" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">way in which they&#39;re deeply together</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.250" end="00:03:26.880" style="s2">they are not separate and that I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">the attempt to do systems change without</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.880" end="00:03:33.190" style="s2">changing our perception changing our</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:36.250" style="s2">perspective is itself like deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.190" end="00:03:37.660" style="s2">misguided in some fundamental way which</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.250" end="00:03:39.970" style="s2">I can&#39;t even really express it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.660" end="00:03:42.250" style="s2">like a felt sense and similarly like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.970" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2">idea that we can somehow just atomized</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.250" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">ourselves and change ourselves over here</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.440" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">without a relationship to the larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:52.330" style="s2">system and the systems that were</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">embedded in that also is well first of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.330" end="00:03:56.709" style="s2">all feels very boring to me but then</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">also I think is just not like a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.709" end="00:04:02.650" style="s2">thing it&#39;s kind of like a bad thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like not actually how things work</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.650" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">in the world so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">of like where I&#39;m at and went with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:14.650" style="s2">with the shift in the podcast it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:17.980" style="s2">kind of like noticing that I was sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.650" end="00:04:20.440" style="s2">over here with the kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.980" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">personal change kind of reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.440" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2">the systems change if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">maintain this dichotomy and now I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">of moving over with the view that I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">generated through all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2">conversations speaking with people like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">some of whom you&#39;re speaking with that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.620" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">now have of like okay this is the flavor</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.700" style="s2">the taste the texture of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:47.070" style="s2">we want to create together like how then</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.700" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">do we then look</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.070" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">back on what is possible in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:54.750" style="s2">personal transformation from that new</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:57.510" style="s2">view and so that&#39;s kind of the ship it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.750" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it for me I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.510" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">it as being quite subtle but it also</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:05.760" style="s2">will result I think in quite different</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:07.290" style="s2">conversations going forward mmm I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.760" end="00:05:08.670" style="s2">something that was coming to mind for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.290" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">while you were speaking there is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.670" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">sense that human beings we are ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.760" end="00:05:20.550" style="s2">systems that exist within system for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">system of thoughts and recurrent</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.550" end="00:05:25.230" style="s2">thoughts and recurrent emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">patterns and indeed bodily systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.230" end="00:05:32.670" style="s2">gastro systems fluids and electricity</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:35.100" style="s2">moving around us all the time and there</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.670" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t a line between that system and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.100" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">except really other than save the skin</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">and what we can feel but like if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t eat this morning then I would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:45.930" style="s2">grouchy now if I didn&#39;t have friends and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:47.610" style="s2">family and loved ones around me then I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.930" end="00:05:50.550" style="s2">be a hell of a lot more miserable than I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.610" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">am now we wouldn&#39;t be having this</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.550" end="00:05:53.700" style="s2">conversation if it was a matter of fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">that we both exist within some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.700" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">shared system within one another then</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:05.850" style="s2">that makes me think perhaps even to this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">idea that we&#39;ve lived under this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.850" end="00:06:11.270" style="s2">idea of say perhaps individualism for</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:14.010" style="s2">quite a long time that people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.270" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">autonomous rulers of this own Kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.010" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">that begins here and ends there and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">legitimizes a lot of the economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">structures we live under as well because</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:26.820" style="s2">the people who are most effective at</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:32.340" style="s2">ruling that Kingdom from here to here</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.820" end="00:06:37.639" style="s2">are those who get to win but well when</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.340" end="00:06:40.099" style="s2">you pick it apart it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.639" end="00:06:42.949" style="s2">simple there&#39;s that phrase man is legion</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.099" end="00:06:44.449" style="s2">for example which I really like and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.949" end="00:06:48.669" style="s2">think that really speaks to the matter</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:54.039" style="s2">like each one of us is many competing</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.669" end="00:06:56.509" style="s2">sub personalities and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.039" end="00:06:58.430" style="s2">oriented towards might be good that true</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.509" end="00:07:02.900" style="s2">and the good and the beautiful and some</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:06.379" style="s2">of them are not an understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:08.360" style="s2">and getting just a feel for that before</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.379" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">even really trying to go in and in size</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.360" end="00:07:12.889" style="s2">on it and change it but just</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.180" style="s2">understanding how all these pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.889" end="00:07:17.889" style="s2">working and where there&#39;s conflict</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:17.889" style="s2">between them and where there&#39;s harmony</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.870" end="00:07:24.520" style="s2">it matters and it seems from that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.850" end="00:07:28.120" style="s2">perspective now like artificial to draw</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.520" end="00:07:29.890" style="s2">that line between weapons here and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.120" end="00:07:33.160" style="s2">happens out there because they&#39;d want a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.890" end="00:07:35.200" style="s2">microcosm with the other mmm yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.160" end="00:07:37.870" style="s2">and what comes to mind and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:41.860" style="s2">think something that Zach Stein has</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.870" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">really clarified for me I know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:47.470" style="s2">had on the show recently it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:50.710" style="s2">I I sometimes think about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.470" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">like maladaptive software that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.710" end="00:07:55.870" style="s2">installed if and so you know we can we</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.710" end="00:07:57.730" style="s2">can play with a way of looking that sees</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.870" end="00:07:59.230" style="s2">that there is no such individual or no</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.730" end="00:08:01.510" style="s2">such thing as an individual right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.230" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">that can be very useful to kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.510" end="00:08:07.270" style="s2">the situation in a in a new way perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:08.530" style="s2">it can also be very useful to see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.270" end="00:08:10.330" style="s2">there are individuals like that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.530" end="00:08:13.420" style="s2">talking to you and that can help us kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.330" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">of reflect or refract the situation in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.420" end="00:08:17.650" style="s2">different way and so one of my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:20.230" style="s2">operating assumptions is that that sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.650" end="00:08:22.570" style="s2">of flexibility in how we look is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.230" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">actually the kind of meta move that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.570" end="00:08:29.590" style="s2">most important that we can say operate</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:32.170" style="s2">from the perspective of the human and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.590" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">the case that you&#39;re speaking about like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.170" end="00:08:36.850" style="s2">what comes to mind is liberal humanism</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:40.540" style="s2">and the way in which this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.850" end="00:08:42.130" style="s2">philosophical almost like it is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.540" end="00:08:43.780" style="s2">of metaphysics it&#39;s a claim about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.130" end="00:08:46.740" style="s2">way the world works right so the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.780" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2">that I render it is like liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.740" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">this idea that we ought to design an</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:55.870" style="s2">economic system that more or less is</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">oriented towards satisfying human</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.870" end="00:09:00.400" style="s2">preferences right that we and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.500" style="s2">humanism is that like you said is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.400" end="00:09:05.590" style="s2">something like the man is the measure of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.500" end="00:09:07.270" style="s2">all things and so you look at that kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.590" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">of core operating system which for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.270" end="00:09:12.430" style="s2">was so deeply embedded into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:15.850" style="s2">psychology and my organism that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.430" end="00:09:19.980" style="s2">taken me years to even sort of be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.850" end="00:09:22.780" style="s2">to peer out of it and you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.980" end="00:09:24.990" style="s2">collectivize that and you see of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.780" end="00:09:27.740" style="s2">we&#39;re destroying the planet</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.990" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">of course were destroying the planet</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.740" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">if you take those two core assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:36.860" style="s2">and it also kind of comes down and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:38.930" style="s2">creates this sense of you know other</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.860" end="00:09:41.210" style="s2">things greatness too but of me being</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.930" end="00:09:43.570" style="s2">over here are you being over there me</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.210" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">somehow having some kind of separate</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:48.790" style="s2">apart existence from the systems that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.910" end="00:09:52.580" style="s2">I&#39;m embedded in and so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.790" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">really helpful to look at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.580" end="00:09:57.350" style="s2">assumptions and ways of seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">perhaps are constellated the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:02.750" style="s2">like you say like it&#39;s not so simple we</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:04.940" style="s2">need to spend perhaps all of our time</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.750" end="00:10:06.860" style="s2">almost all of our time actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.940" end="00:10:10.450" style="s2">clear about the situation in the problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.860" end="00:10:14.180" style="s2">space and and less of it acting I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.450" end="00:10:16.820" style="s2">because to act with a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.180" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">of what the problem actually is is quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.820" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">likely to just create new problems that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">we then have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:28.319" style="s2">oh I can&#39;t hear you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.190" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">if that&#39;s me still can&#39;t hear you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">can hear me though</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.530" end="00:10:46.610" style="s2">there you go yeah you got me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">okay now now I have to try and remember</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.610" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">that thread yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.380" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">one of my thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.520" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">right conflict conflict that exists</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.300" end="00:11:13.560" style="s2">within people that so often then ends up</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.940" end="00:11:15.640" style="s2">getting projected outwards is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">fascinating and perhaps one of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.640" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">real interesting insights a of the debt</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:28.600" style="s2">psychology movement that often the parts</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">of self that we are most uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.600" end="00:11:40.029" style="s2">with we will identify in those around us</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:42.040" style="s2">really pick on so I mean I can talk from</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.029" end="00:11:46.060" style="s2">experience having at times felt like</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.040" end="00:11:48.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve been just out of control with</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.060" end="00:11:51.940" style="s2">certain destructive behavior patterns</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.910" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">consumptive behavior patterns and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.940" end="00:11:56.080" style="s2">when I see that happening you see</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:11:58.600" style="s2">someone else engaging in that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.080" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">like a real visceral disgust to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.600" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">like dude why are you doing that and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:12.050" style="s2">when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">talking about this personal development</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.050" end="00:12:16.930" style="s2">great stuff I mean that&#39;s such a broad</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:16.930" style="s2">umbrella but</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:23.710" style="s2">I think well a big part of it for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.540" end="00:12:28.080" style="s2">recently has been like understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.710" end="00:12:28.080" style="s2">these points of conflict and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.899" end="00:12:32.439" style="s2">- just like if the conflict can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.939" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">gotten rid of then at least get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.439" end="00:12:37.290" style="s2">some of the feelings of frustration or</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">guilt around the fact that that conflict</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.290" end="00:12:44.350" style="s2">exists I&#39;m actually not entirely sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">where I&#39;m going with that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.350" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">referred there yeah well I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.300" end="00:13:02.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.000" end="00:13:07.370" style="s2">sophistication that I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.840" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">referring to which I in in my world so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.370" end="00:13:12.070" style="s2">part of the reason why I made this shift</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:14.900" style="s2">in the podcast is also because I live at</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.070" end="00:13:17.210" style="s2">this place called a monastic Academy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.900" end="00:13:20.060" style="s2">there I&#39;m doing a lot of work to design</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.210" end="00:13:22.820" style="s2">curriculum and the the the stated</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.060" end="00:13:25.160" style="s2">purpose of the curriculum is to create</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.820" end="00:13:27.770" style="s2">what we sometimes call awakened leaders</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.160" end="00:13:31.520" style="s2">but essentially you can unpack that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.770" end="00:13:34.310" style="s2">mean people who have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.520" end="00:13:37.790" style="s2">lean into the world in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.310" end="00:13:40.490" style="s2">it kind of bends toward justice bends</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.790" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">toward goodness constructs the more</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.490" end="00:13:43.550" style="s2">beautiful world our hearts tell us is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:47.390" style="s2">possible and so there&#39;s this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.550" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">inquiry about how do we create those</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.390" end="00:13:53.150" style="s2">people what does it mean to create those</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:57.320" style="s2">people and when I hear you speak about</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.150" end="00:14:01.000" style="s2">how you have this kind of reflexivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.320" end="00:14:04.700" style="s2">about what it means to judge another</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.000" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">that for me is like a kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.700" end="00:14:09.650" style="s2">like a core component of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.920" end="00:14:11.000" style="s2">person right they and and I I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.650" end="00:14:13.880" style="s2">have this we do a practice called</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.000" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">circling at many are familiar circling</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.880" end="00:14:20.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like a relational meditation</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:22.370" style="s2">practice at maple Manasseh Academy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.290" end="00:14:26.750" style="s2">one of the teachers there has brought</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.370" end="00:14:30.590" style="s2">this fantastic little what is it like</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.750" end="00:14:33.530" style="s2">add on practice with encircling there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.590" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">called mere swords and so we typically</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.530" end="00:14:38.840" style="s2">have like a sign like some this is audio</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.460" style="s2">you can&#39;t see it but I&#39;m holding my hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.840" end="00:14:43.550" style="s2">in such a way that I can indicate you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.460" end="00:14:45.530" style="s2">right so I say I have a mere sword for</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.550" end="00:14:48.650" style="s2">you and that&#39;s it that means like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.530" end="00:14:51.200" style="s2">judgement that I have about you but that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.650" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">I know that I then hold up the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.200" end="00:14:56.390" style="s2">because it also means that I have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:58.490" style="s2">judgment about me right and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.390" end="00:15:01.280" style="s2">a very as you say like a union sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.490" end="00:15:04.840" style="s2">this goes way back but that we can even</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.280" end="00:15:07.220" style="s2">see that I think is a huge innovation in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.840" end="00:15:09.500" style="s2">human consciousness because most people</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.220" end="00:15:09.769" style="s2">are just totally blind to the way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.500" end="00:15:11.929" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.769" end="00:15:15.319" style="s2">check that out into the world right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.929" end="00:15:18.619" style="s2">how much peacefulness and coherence can</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.319" end="00:15:21.319" style="s2">we generate by owning our projections</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.619" end="00:15:23.749" style="s2">but then also like by sharing them with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.319" end="00:15:25.399" style="s2">each other so that we can all grow if</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.749" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the state of intention so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.399" end="00:15:30.379" style="s2">like I love that kind of thing I love it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:33.589" style="s2">because not just to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.379" end="00:15:36.139" style="s2">oh I&#39;m judging you I must have that part</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.589" end="00:15:38.239" style="s2">inside of me and I probably have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.139" end="00:15:40.910" style="s2">of messed up relationship with it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.239" end="00:15:42.199" style="s2">then also to either tell other people</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.910" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">because that&#39;s like the courageous thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.199" end="00:15:46.759" style="s2">to do and quite beautiful I think but</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:49.459" style="s2">also to be told there&#39;s somebody to care</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.759" end="00:15:51.860" style="s2">enough about you to give you their nasty</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.459" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2"> they&#39;re nasty judgements it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.860" end="00:15:57.949" style="s2">I I serious that as being such a gift</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:16:01.489" style="s2">and so beautiful when people care enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.949" end="00:16:05.059" style="s2">about me to tell me how they like see</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.489" end="00:16:06.769" style="s2">know are judging the hell out of me and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.059" end="00:16:09.410" style="s2">and three that&#39;s increasingly I see that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.769" end="00:16:11.749" style="s2">as like a core capacity of these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.410" end="00:16:13.699" style="s2">of people that we want to create is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.749" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">the courage and willingness to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.699" end="00:16:17.540" style="s2">transparent about these kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:19.209" style="s2">instead of as is very common in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.540" end="00:16:21.379" style="s2">spiritual circles kind of just like</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.209" end="00:16:23.269" style="s2">hiding them and maybe doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.379" end="00:16:24.499" style="s2">yourself a little bit but like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.269" end="00:16:26.259" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.499" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">judgemental I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Eve it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.259" end="00:16:34.020" style="s2">having these tendencies yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:37.150" style="s2">something very</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.020" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">liberating about being able to show</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.150" end="00:16:43.720" style="s2">those you know less what would I call</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:46.120" style="s2">them it&#39;s not less desirable but like</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.720" end="00:16:49.420" style="s2">less normally socially acceptable signs</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.120" end="00:16:51.460" style="s2">of self others and it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.420" end="00:16:53.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot recently around</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.460" end="00:16:55.720" style="s2">this idea of perfection and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.590" end="00:16:58.810" style="s2">standard of convention that I think to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.720" end="00:17:00.220" style="s2">just some degree well I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.810" end="00:17:01.750" style="s2">can say everybody because I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.220" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">but I certainly have walked around with</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.750" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">the inside my head link I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:07.780" style="s2">a deep unconscious sense of like having</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.600" style="s2">to be perfect and having to be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.780" end="00:17:13.420" style="s2">means having to like everybody and be</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.600" end="00:17:17.920" style="s2">totally at peace in every situation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.420" end="00:17:20.290" style="s2">and manifest a kind of goodness and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.920" end="00:17:21.790" style="s2">trust and love towards everybody but the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.290" end="00:17:26.010" style="s2">issue is if that just leads to you being</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.790" end="00:17:28.690" style="s2">inauthentic and holding back and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.010" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">then it&#39;s missing something and there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.690" end="00:17:33.970" style="s2">that freedom that comes with with</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:38.260" style="s2">opening that space up and really being</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.970" end="00:17:43.030" style="s2">able to just own in company the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.260" end="00:17:45.580" style="s2">that we have we have nasty bits you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.030" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of my a conversation we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.580" end="00:17:50.410" style="s2">with Ian McGilchrist a few months and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:53.230" style="s2">one of the things that just reminds this</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.410" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">stuck in my head was he said as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.230" end="00:17:57.880" style="s2">psychiatrist one of the things that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.990" end="00:18:00.340" style="s2">just heard and was fascinated by over</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.880" end="00:18:02.290" style="s2">and over again was how many people on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.340" end="00:18:04.380" style="s2">deep level really believe that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.290" end="00:18:09.030" style="s2">perfect and that they have to be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.380" end="00:18:09.030" style="s2">hmm but how much</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.420" end="00:18:15.030" style="s2">inner conflict and as a result Alta</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.630" end="00:18:16.500" style="s2">conflict gets produced as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.030" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">the fact that things don&#39;t really match</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.500" end="00:18:25.010" style="s2">up with that idea and I guess where my</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">thought has gone recently is like oh if</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.010" end="00:18:30.600" style="s2">it is a correct statement to say that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:32.940" style="s2">there seems to be something that exists</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.600" end="00:18:34.680" style="s2">within what would you say the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.940" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">unconscious makeup of released a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.680" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">us is this idea of perfection where does</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">that come from now if we learn idea what</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">are your thoughts on that do you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:55.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a fair judgment of people to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:58.950" style="s2">description of psychic makeup well I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.620" end="00:19:00.120" style="s2">mean I can certainly I&#39;ll speak for</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.950" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">myself because I don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.120" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">training in this area but</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:12.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve been sometimes I used the four</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.710" end="00:19:14.360" style="s2">facet model from integral philosophy to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.770" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">talk about like human development so</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.360" end="00:19:18.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing a lot of what is called</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:21.500" style="s2">in that model cleaning up recently like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.890" end="00:19:22.610" style="s2">working with shadow material sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.500" end="00:19:26.200" style="s2">like what we&#39;ve been talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.610" end="00:19:32.300" style="s2">little bit and I&#39;ve noticed for me that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.200" end="00:19:34.610" style="s2">my drive to perfection is constellated</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.300" end="00:19:37.270" style="s2">as a response to a deep feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.610" end="00:19:39.260" style="s2">inadequacy worthlessness and brokenness</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.270" end="00:19:42.470" style="s2">right that there&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.260" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">feeling belief that I&#39;m worthless that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.470" end="00:19:47.480" style="s2">I&#39;m somehow fundamentally broken and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:51.040" style="s2">that like that got encrusted over with</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.480" end="00:19:53.480" style="s2">this compensatory drive towards</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.040" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">appearing to be perfect and smart and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.480" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">competent and yeah I mean it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:02.780" style="s2">ball and chain that I&#39;ve been wearing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:03.890" style="s2">for most of my life and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.780" end="00:20:05.540" style="s2">recently as I&#39;ve kind of gotten</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.890" end="00:20:08.990" style="s2">underneath it to look at these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.540" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">wounds or these beliefs that I felt a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.990" end="00:20:12.950" style="s2">little bit liberated by it but I I in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.210" end="00:20:18.200" style="s2">model I think as I&#39;m speaking I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.950" end="00:20:21.410" style="s2">realizing this in my model I imagine or</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.200" end="00:20:24.170" style="s2">I believe that those who feel that like</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.410" end="00:20:27.620" style="s2">intense drive to perfection also having</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.170" end="00:20:29.990" style="s2">them this deep wound of inadequacy</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.620" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">worthlessness something like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:33.410" style="s2">that I noticed that having that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:35.809" style="s2">perspective generates a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.410" end="00:20:39.700" style="s2">compassion both for myself in those</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.809" end="00:20:44.690" style="s2">instances but also for others who I see</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:46.070" style="s2">operating from that yeah yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.690" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">curious what you what you feel about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.070" end="00:20:52.030" style="s2">or not I think that that resonates I</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">mean where I&#39;ve been thinking is more</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.030" end="00:20:58.190" style="s2">from the actual I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:00.679" style="s2">it in terms of religion and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.190" end="00:21:02.990" style="s2">worldviews actually where my wandering</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.679" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">is is that is it some kind of hangover</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.990" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">from seeing existence through like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:13.070" style="s2">kind of two world lens mmm and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:18.890" style="s2">there is the perfect divine sphere and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:24.740" style="s2">then the fallen sinful corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.890" end="00:21:27.050" style="s2">human world and just wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.740" end="00:21:29.570" style="s2">know use the word software earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.050" end="00:21:34.040" style="s2">the conversation if that software has</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.570" end="00:21:37.010" style="s2">been run by people far mmm thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.040" end="00:21:40.120" style="s2">years we may say at least at least a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.010" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">couple of thousand years yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.120" end="00:21:48.050" style="s2">even if perhaps we no longer consciously</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">adhere to the idea that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.050" end="00:21:52.910" style="s2">world of original sin I&#39;m lapsing into</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">Christian but we&#39;re in the West we&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.910" end="00:21:57.920" style="s2">longer but we&#39;re still in that world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:59.930" style="s2">that there is the transcendent world</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.920" end="00:22:02.780" style="s2">that exists somewhere but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.930" end="00:22:04.430" style="s2">access to church anymore I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.780" end="00:22:07.100" style="s2">perhaps it tax itself on to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.430" end="00:22:10.730" style="s2">mythology of liberal humanism like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.100" end="00:22:13.550" style="s2">perfect world exists that place you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.730" end="00:22:15.290" style="s2">get to if you just buy the right things</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.550" end="00:22:19.550" style="s2">yeah serve yourself out by the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.290" end="00:22:22.190" style="s2">things yeah yeah I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.550" end="00:22:23.450" style="s2">to what you&#39;re saying I think it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.190" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.450" end="00:22:28.670" style="s2">looking at this and I I think I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:31.400" style="s2">yet explored as much as I ought to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.670" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">sort of Christian roots of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.400" end="00:22:37.310" style="s2">ideas but it must be the case right that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:39.230" style="s2">like that original sin is functioning in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.310" end="00:22:40.310" style="s2">my consciousness to a greater degree and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.230" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">not our consciousness to a greater</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.310" end="00:22:47.870" style="s2">degree that we think and yeah I I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">it you know in general though like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.870" end="00:22:51.890" style="s2">also comes up for me is that within the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">sort of more spiritual milieu there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.890" end="00:22:57.290" style="s2">this very kind of this platitude that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:59.570" style="s2">everything is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.290" end="00:23:01.040" style="s2">right like and and you should</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.570" end="00:23:03.620" style="s2">acknowledge that everything is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.040" end="00:23:05.930" style="s2">spiritually everything is perfect and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.620" end="00:23:09.020" style="s2">to a certain degree if you could just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.930" end="00:23:13.040" style="s2">see that you would be happy and chill</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.020" end="00:23:14.810" style="s2">and whatever and again that what comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.040" end="00:23:16.730" style="s2">to mind is is what we really want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.810" end="00:23:19.790" style="s2">cultivate is a flexibility in ways of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.730" end="00:23:22.430" style="s2">seeing because it&#39;s really awesome to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.790" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">see that everything is perfect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.430" end="00:23:27.290" style="s2">excellent it&#39;s an excellent way to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">things that you are already perfect that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.290" end="00:23:31.160" style="s2">nothing needs to be done that perfection</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:32.360" style="s2">is like an imminent experience that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.160" end="00:23:35.480" style="s2">just available to you right</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.360" end="00:23:37.549" style="s2">now if you just stop struggling like</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.480" end="00:23:39.920" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome really profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.549" end="00:23:42.860" style="s2">beautiful and also like is mad</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.920" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">broken and we have to work our asses off</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.860" end="00:23:47.960" style="s2">to fix it and I want to be around people</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:50.630" style="s2">who can like oscillate skilfully between</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.960" end="00:23:52.820" style="s2">those two and many other ways of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.630" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">the situation because that&#39;s really for</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.820" end="00:23:57.260" style="s2">me like that&#39;s the that&#39;s the key that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:24:01.280" style="s2">the dance it&#39;s like can we like pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.260" end="00:24:04.160" style="s2">and let go of these frames in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.280" end="00:24:05.870" style="s2">explore usefully and be a benefit in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.160" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">this time of transition it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.870" end="00:24:10.820" style="s2">you can&#39;t get stuck even when I say oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.510" end="00:24:12.950" style="s2">you know these this drive to perfection</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.820" end="00:24:14.390" style="s2">has its roots and inadequacy it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.950" end="00:24:16.820" style="s2">that&#39;s just a way of looking that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.390" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">depends on a whole psychological frame</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.820" end="00:24:21.559" style="s2">that you know I&#39;m not committed to if</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:23.299" style="s2">that might be completely wrong way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.559" end="00:24:25.040" style="s2">look at it maybe it better to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.299" end="00:24:27.350" style="s2">in this case more like from a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.040" end="00:24:28.700" style="s2">kind of historical construction where</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.350" end="00:24:31.040" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s better to look at it like</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.700" end="00:24:32.660" style="s2">from the perspective of this sacred that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.040" end="00:24:35.620" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of like struggling in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.660" end="00:24:39.530" style="s2">this schoolhouse of life to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.620" end="00:24:41.540" style="s2">those kind of what look like wounds but</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.530" end="00:24:43.040" style="s2">are actually catalyst for our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.540" end="00:24:45.110" style="s2">development and for the state like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.040" end="00:24:47.179" style="s2">salvation of the world like maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.110" end="00:24:49.309" style="s2">more of an interesting and useful way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.179" end="00:24:51.260" style="s2">look at I don&#39;t know but I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.309" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">around people who like I also don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:24:57.230" style="s2">and want to play like that mmm</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:25:00.890" style="s2">you know I&#39;m thinking now of the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.230" end="00:25:03.320" style="s2">chapter of Zack Stein&#39;s book that I read</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.890" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">because of your podcast thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.320" end="00:25:10.450" style="s2">you know the last chapter right I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:12.200" style="s2">presume where he&#39;s talking I mean about</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.450" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">what are the books on</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.200" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">education for people listening and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.880" end="00:25:19.100" style="s2">last chapter is really about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:22.100" style="s2">education and he quotes a bunch from</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.100" end="00:25:27.110" style="s2">slavery Jack&#39;s writing on Western</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.100" end="00:25:30.710" style="s2">Buddhism and the gtex argument that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.110" end="00:25:34.610" style="s2">some sense a certain form of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.710" end="00:25:38.630" style="s2">has become the religion par excellence</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.610" end="00:25:44.419" style="s2">for capitalism but the very fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:50.299" style="s2">pretty much teaches accept yeah step the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.419" end="00:25:52.370" style="s2">way things are be at peace with it life</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.299" end="00:25:56.870" style="s2">is suffering but you can transcend it if</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.370" end="00:25:59.480" style="s2">you just let go of your desires it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.870" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">just kind of funny given that I mean as</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.480" end="00:26:02.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve already pointed out like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.250" style="s2">paradigm we live under it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.120" end="00:26:07.149" style="s2">the satisfaction of desires and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.250" end="00:26:11.500" style="s2">weird sense of transcendence through</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.149" end="00:26:11.500" style="s2">achieving and chasing desire</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.680" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">hmm yeah yeah I love I love its critique</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.660" end="00:26:19.930" style="s2">I mean he called this is very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.740" style="s2">when she calls it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.930" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">I think the hegemonic ideology of late</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.740" end="00:26:29.920" style="s2">capitalism which that&#39;s pretty caustic</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty radical and yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.920" end="00:26:35.350" style="s2">what comes to mind it&#39;s just like I know</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:39.100" style="s2">so many people okay wait let me make</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.350" end="00:26:41.320" style="s2">sure this is a fair assessment I used to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.100" end="00:26:44.940" style="s2">live in Boulder Colorado very much a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.320" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">center for spirituality in America and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.940" end="00:26:55.230" style="s2">there were I knew or it was common for</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">people to be Buddhist and consist</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.230" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">consume so much stuff go to Whole Foods</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">you know participate in this whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">emerging economy and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:16.990" style="s2">that feels to me very tricky about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:19.660" style="s2">area it&#39;s like I and I did it - I did it</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.990" end="00:27:22.570" style="s2">- and I used Buddhism I used these</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.660" end="00:27:26.170" style="s2">practices to kind of numb out and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.570" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">chill well participating in what I if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.170" end="00:27:31.500" style="s2">really asked myself and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:37.260" style="s2">honest with myself our systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.500" end="00:27:40.590" style="s2">destroying the planet and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.260" end="00:27:42.550" style="s2">there&#39;s something more here than just</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.590" end="00:27:44.410" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be something more here</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.550" end="00:27:46.810" style="s2">than just feeling good I&#39;m feeling at</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.410" end="00:27:51.610" style="s2">peace and giving up some of our desires</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.810" end="00:27:54.130" style="s2">for our own well-being and it&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.610" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">don&#39;t know what else to say other than I</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.130" end="00:27:59.980" style="s2">I just I really feel resonant with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:01.750" style="s2">concern that slob logic has I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.980" end="00:28:03.730" style="s2">think he gives enough credit to Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.750" end="00:28:06.520" style="s2">I think like Western Buddhism is it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:09.550" style="s2">a kind of particular synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.520" end="00:28:11.130" style="s2">Buddhism that is you know or the Western</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.550" end="00:28:13.900" style="s2">Buddhism that he was critiquing is is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">particularly problematic strain of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.900" end="00:28:19.180" style="s2">Buddhism it doesn&#39;t have to be like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:22.020" style="s2">and Buddhism itself isn&#39;t any particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.180" end="00:28:22.020" style="s2">way but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.060" end="00:28:30.710" style="s2">yeah well I&#39;m interested in the perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.700" end="00:28:34.190" style="s2">the contrast between spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.710" end="00:28:37.040" style="s2">that seem to be about escaping and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.190" end="00:28:41.570" style="s2">transcending the world versus ones that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.040" end="00:28:46.990" style="s2">seem to be about optimizing yourself for</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.570" end="00:28:51.950" style="s2">actually being in the world now I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.990" end="00:28:53.900" style="s2">you get strands of that within all</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.950" end="00:28:55.700" style="s2">origins I mean it reminds me it goes</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.900" end="00:28:57.590" style="s2">back to that point I was making perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.700" end="00:28:59.990" style="s2">that is again my thinking around that to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.590" end="00:29:02.300" style="s2">world mythology if you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.990" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">wrapped up in the sense that there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.300" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">the perfect sphere and we&#39;re not in it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">and the way to get there well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:12.860" style="s2">know if it&#39;s do spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:15.680" style="s2">produce through something but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.860" end="00:29:20.630" style="s2">never quite there and so there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.680" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">a kind of inability to be fully present</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.630" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">with the here and now</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.130" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">although that&#39;s interesting because then</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.210" end="00:29:31.400" style="s2">I think of the mindfulness movement</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:33.230" style="s2">which seems to have taken the practices</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.400" end="00:29:35.000" style="s2">out of the East and remove them of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.230" end="00:29:36.800" style="s2">spiritual bent and then it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.000" end="00:29:38.750" style="s2">it&#39;s all about learning to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.800" end="00:29:40.790" style="s2">here and now but I think that also uses</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.750" end="00:29:43.820" style="s2">something so now we&#39;re at like to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.790" end="00:29:45.950" style="s2">multi-perspective ilysm again yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.820" end="00:29:50.570" style="s2">it&#39;s so tricky and this is I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.950" end="00:29:52.460" style="s2">is what I spent so much of my time kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.570" end="00:29:57.050" style="s2">of quote-unquote trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.460" end="00:29:59.240" style="s2">right like how do we deploy what Jon</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.050" end="00:30:01.490" style="s2">Verve a key would call like an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.240" end="00:30:05.780" style="s2">of practices in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.490" end="00:30:08.540" style="s2">actually resolves some of these like</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.780" end="00:30:12.230" style="s2">maladaptive conditionings and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.540" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">looking such that we are like we can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.230" end="00:30:16.160" style="s2">liberated to participate in this time</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:21.710" style="s2">between worlds like what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.160" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2">like and it is not easy it is not easy</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.710" end="00:30:28.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy in there&#39;s so many ways in</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:33.410" style="s2">which these practices these technologies</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.730" end="00:30:35.419" style="s2">can instead of liberating that possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.410" end="00:30:39.309" style="s2">future version</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.419" end="00:30:42.679" style="s2">of ourselves become reduced into</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.309" end="00:30:46.039" style="s2">something that reifies and gives</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.679" end="00:30:48.950" style="s2">permission to some of that maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.039" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">conditioning and it&#39;s like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.950" end="00:30:57.079" style="s2">very very very tricky each time that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">think I have a or typically when I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.079" end="00:31:04.729" style="s2">that I know what it will take I later</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:06.019" style="s2">find that I was actually like doing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.729" end="00:31:08.749" style="s2">very thing that I was just saying kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.019" end="00:31:12.229" style="s2">of like taking a partial perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.749" end="00:31:16.719" style="s2">like wanting it to be a certain way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.229" end="00:31:22.549" style="s2">it&#39;s endlessly fascinating to me and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.719" end="00:31:24.709" style="s2">endlessly humbling I&#39;ve been spending</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.549" end="00:31:26.659" style="s2">some time more recently in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.709" end="00:31:30.139" style="s2">circles of Alexander bard the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.659" end="00:31:31.789" style="s2">philosopher mm-hmm he is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.139" end="00:31:34.159" style="s2">because he seems to be in this space but</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.789" end="00:31:35.869" style="s2">then also with a kind of different angle</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.159" end="00:31:38.929" style="s2">and I think he seems to be having this</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.869" end="00:31:42.229" style="s2">spirituality around creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.929" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">creating a sense of a grand narrative I</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.229" end="00:31:47.329" style="s2">mean I suppose one of his big pointers</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:50.089" style="s2">we need a grand narrative again which</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.329" end="00:31:52.190" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting to observe that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.089" end="00:31:55.729" style="s2">seems to get under the skin of some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.190" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">the more American like anglo-saxon</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.729" end="00:32:00.139" style="s2">people in this space who there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:03.109" style="s2">that actually grand narratives are over</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.139" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">and that we need this like meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.109" end="00:32:09.829" style="s2">multi-perspective ilysm but also like to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:12.499" style="s2">chill out and let come let emerge rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.829" end="00:32:14.450" style="s2">than trying to to like push through it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.499" end="00:32:17.649" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing the best justice</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.450" end="00:32:17.649" style="s2">to spective here but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.410" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">there is that it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.430" end="00:32:26.870" style="s2">dichotomy that&#39;s going on there and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:30.230" style="s2">fascinated by the fact that there seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.870" end="00:32:33.740" style="s2">to be some rivalry hmm like for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.230" end="00:32:34.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard Alexander refer to the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.740" end="00:32:36.440" style="s2">of stuff that were bunch of you North</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:37.850" style="s2">Americans doing is that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.440" end="00:32:40.430" style="s2">good stuff but ultimately they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.850" end="00:32:44.600" style="s2">sitting around in circles talking which</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.430" end="00:32:47.750" style="s2">which people so I would think the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.600" end="00:32:49.550" style="s2">neuro hacker collective guy the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.750" end="00:32:53.330" style="s2">collective intelligence death yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.550" end="00:32:55.550" style="s2">yeah John drove a key as well like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.330" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">think in fact the language is used it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.550" end="00:32:59.300" style="s2">like they&#39;re working on on the will to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:02.510" style="s2">intelligence but not the will to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.300" end="00:33:04.430" style="s2">transcendence which is mmm to build to</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.510" end="00:33:07.070" style="s2">actually build that which comes next as</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.430" end="00:33:09.550" style="s2">opposed to just he would use the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.070" end="00:33:15.230" style="s2">talking about what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.550" end="00:33:16.460" style="s2">mmm yeah I mean it&#39;s sure and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.230" end="00:33:18.140" style="s2">talk about what comes next before we</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.460" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">build it and we probably should you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.140" end="00:33:24.230" style="s2">talk about it well and when we when that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:26.350" style="s2">tipping point comes I think is you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.230" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">different people have different</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.350" end="00:33:29.900" style="s2">sensibilities around that and also like</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:32.300" style="s2">I kind of agree I mean that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.900" end="00:33:35.090" style="s2">lives where I live I feel like I am in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.300" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">fact building and participating in</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.090" end="00:33:40.790" style="s2">creating what comes next which you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:45.560" style="s2">we could get into that but you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.790" end="00:33:47.900" style="s2">I also would I talk a lot about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.560" end="00:33:50.600" style="s2">perspectival flexibility and meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.900" end="00:33:53.870" style="s2">perspective flexibility at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.600" end="00:33:54.350" style="s2">if all of that flexibility is not in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.870" end="00:33:58.010" style="s2">service</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.350" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">other grand narratives so to speak then</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.010" end="00:34:02.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s feels quite masturbatory</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">I think that that grand narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.500" end="00:34:06.430" style="s2">implicit in things like the neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.100" style="s2">collective right but we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.430" end="00:34:10.270" style="s2">explicit the world is on fire</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.100" end="00:34:13.030" style="s2">leverage your perspectives choose</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.270" end="00:34:15.340" style="s2">perspectives accordingly right this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.030" end="00:34:17.890" style="s2">the time to show up this is the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.340" end="00:34:20.470" style="s2">when we need heroes you ought to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.890" end="00:34:22.600" style="s2">a hero use your perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.470" end="00:34:25.390" style="s2">flexibility to create or recreate</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.600" end="00:34:27.220" style="s2">yourself as a hero and that for me is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.390" end="00:34:31.330" style="s2">the creative impulse right is that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.220" end="00:34:35.710" style="s2">now get to decide it&#39;s hard we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.330" end="00:34:38.220" style="s2">to create ourselves into these heroic</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.710" end="00:34:40.390" style="s2">individuals who can stand forth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.220" end="00:34:42.160" style="s2">attempt to do the impossible the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.390" end="00:34:43.750" style="s2">seemingly impossible of what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.160" end="00:34:45.340" style="s2">green Hall calls threading the eye of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.750" end="00:34:47.320" style="s2">the needle and actually coming out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.340" end="00:34:48.640" style="s2">other side of it in a way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.320" end="00:34:51.010" style="s2">better off than when we started</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.640" end="00:34:54.160" style="s2">and that is exciting to me that bat for</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.010" end="00:34:56.770" style="s2">me like fills me with you know libido as</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.160" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">Alexander bard might like College yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.770" end="00:35:04.930" style="s2">that felt good Daniel I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:07.330" style="s2">passionate I liked it yeah yeah I mean</p>
