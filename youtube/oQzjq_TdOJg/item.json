    "title": "Awakened Leaders and Systems Change with Daniel Thorson",
    "description": "This conversation was recorded a couple of months ago, but its message feels very current. Our guest this time is Daniel Thorson, a resident at the Monastic Academy and host of the excellent Emerge podcast. In this, part one of our conversation, we discuss: the interconnectedness of systems change and personal growth, and how the minds we use to solve today’s problems are products of systems that are destroying themselves; the work of the Monastic Academy in creating awakened leaders; the importance of being able to hold multiple, sometimes contradictory perspectives within one’s worldview; Slavoj Zizek’s critique of Western Buddhism as the hegemonic ideology of late capitalism; how the pathologies of Western Buddhism show up in the contemporary spiritual scene; and heroism and the process of being in service to a grand narrative of how to improve the world.\n \nDaniel can be found here\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dthorson\n\nAnd his excellent Emerge podcast here\n\nhttp://www.whatisemerging.com/emergepodcast\n\nFind the Monastic Academy here\n\nhttps://www.monasticacademy.com/",
