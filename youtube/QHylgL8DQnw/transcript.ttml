<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">opio is a vision of something this kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">of architecture and it&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">kind of touched on here and there in all</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">the videos but that again that is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:26.539" style="s2">this architecture is in the book we call</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:26.539" style="s2">it a source code for an emerging culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.960" end="00:00:36.920" style="s2">so this would be the vision the very</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">large vision of creating opie O&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.920" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">looking at a better world than seeing an</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">emerging culture and so the way I look</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">at it is in traditional society or</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">current society there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.649" end="00:00:55.530" style="s2">where there&#39;s a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">constraints and we talked about this in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.530" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">the previous video and the whitest</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">constraint is the governance right so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">the government sets constraints the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">government doesn&#39;t really set</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">possibilities anymore there&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">sense that its regulatory sets</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">constraints it has its own federal</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">agenda and within that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">financial system of investors and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">venture capital and grants and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:31.610" style="s2">government and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">pressure and constraints and lack of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.610" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2">flexibility and fluidity between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:43.409" style="s2">government and the financial system the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">financial system then the corporations</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.409" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">are heavily now depended upon the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">financial system there&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:53.000" style="s2">critique of virtual production cycles in</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">the financial system has become</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.000" end="00:01:58.310" style="s2">something that has really constrained</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:01.219" style="s2">corporations so we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.310" end="00:02:04.250" style="s2">responsibility to investors and venture</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.219" end="00:02:08.459" style="s2">capitalists and just kind of absentee</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.250" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">shareholders so this is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.459" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">corporation and the corporation may have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">subsidiaries and because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.060" style="s2">subsidiaries are not under the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">pressure but the corporation&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.060" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">parent corporations of the parent</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:21.959" style="s2">corporations have to pass on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:25.080" style="s2">pressure to the subsidiaries and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.959" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">course each subsidiary within the each</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.080" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">organization with its subsidiary then</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">creates its architecture to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">constrained by these pressures on and on</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:39.030" style="s2">and on and on until the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:46.890" style="s2">here can imagine something that&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.030" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">and participatory but there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.890" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">contraction going into the daily and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">ordinary life of this individual or this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">team so that seems to me to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:11.150" style="s2">contraction of let&#39;s say a very mature</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">or late stage capitalist society with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.150" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">representational government not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:19.349" style="s2">participatory one so this is a very big</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">and broad stroke but I think that we all</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.349" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">feel this the individual entrepreneur at</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:31.139" style="s2">this level feeling all this pressure is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:35.220" style="s2">really at doesn&#39;t really have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.139" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">Liberty to liberate the employee because</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.220" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">there&#39;s all these other constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">the employee is not directly involved in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:46.970" style="s2">so the whole system kind of works as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:50.099" style="s2">system of nested invariant structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.970" end="00:03:52.069" style="s2">that&#39;s not and what makes them invariant</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.099" end="00:03:57.500" style="s2">is the same as saying they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.069" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">responsive so we don&#39;t see in here an</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.500" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">opportunity for any synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">so with the Opio envisions in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.220" end="00:04:16.100" style="s2">an emerging culture and we&#39;ll haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">gotten to it but we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.100" end="00:04:22.040" style="s2">governance here the endothermic</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:23.570" style="s2">governance in the center it says if</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.040" end="00:04:25.389" style="s2">instead of having the government or</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.570" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">governance being this top-down</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.389" end="00:04:30.650" style="s2">constraint it&#39;s a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">governance and so if you think of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.650" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">say the water the ocean level and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">is the water level and here is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:44.510" style="s2">larger culture or the larger society</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:48.580" style="s2">instead of government coming down and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.510" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">constraining what we have is a cup is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">participation of many streams right all</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:05:01.430" style="s2">this little local participation that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:06.380" style="s2">bubbles up and co evolves a governance</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.430" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">right inside an organization and there</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.380" end="00:05:10.280" style="s2">are many of these right so there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:12.410" style="s2">governance and many participatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.280" end="00:05:17.270" style="s2">organizations many groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.410" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">participating together co-evolving the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.270" end="00:05:24.950" style="s2">governance the inside right at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:28.190" style="s2">of this these organizations and then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.950" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">governance describes because when we get</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.190" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">to the government&#39;s will see the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:36.289" style="s2">governance describes defines and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:39.470" style="s2">delineates what what the performance</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.289" end="00:05:40.910" style="s2">zones are the objectives and the values</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.470" end="00:05:42.770" style="s2">in the performance zones and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.910" end="00:05:45.620" style="s2">objectives and the values in the network</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.770" end="00:05:47.539" style="s2">performance zones and there&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.620" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">by which that evolves over time so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.539" end="00:05:56.360" style="s2">governance makes possible the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:06:01.910" style="s2">delineation of these core performance</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:06:07.220" style="s2">value zones right the governance is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.910" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">where we describe define and design the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.220" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">core performance value zones that create</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:16.340" style="s2">value inside the organization and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:20.120" style="s2">in the culture and then what we have is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.340" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">the network value zones that start</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.120" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">to bubble up so this is like bubbling up</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">because the network performance value</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:32.389" style="s2">zones have an inside and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">synergistic relationship to the outside</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.389" end="00:06:38.360" style="s2">so they start to perform in the larger</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">culture above this let&#39;s say water level</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.360" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">and as those are that synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:50.449" style="s2">participation happens then it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.580" end="00:06:53.210" style="s2">this value that&#39;s created right so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.449" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">this organization value I say gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.210" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">exported as wealth into the culture in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:04.850" style="s2">these these extra organizational values</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:07.850" style="s2">like support adaptation access and can</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.850" end="00:07:10.850" style="s2">be incubation they become part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.850" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">wealth of the culture so I like to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.850" end="00:07:21.410" style="s2">these bubbles as if they start to rise</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:23.449" style="s2">up from the organization into the larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.410" end="00:07:28.090" style="s2">culture and it&#39;s not just from one</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.449" end="00:07:28.090" style="s2">organization but it&#39;s from many</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.210" end="00:07:46.220" style="s2">organizations right so it&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.720" end="00:07:50.690" style="s2">the locus of cultural transformation to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.220" end="00:07:54.880" style="s2">come from inside the locus of production</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.690" end="00:08:00.039" style="s2">and these these open participatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.880" end="00:08:00.039" style="s2">organizations become the leading edge</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:13.250" style="s2">supporting the export of wealth to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.530" end="00:08:18.699" style="s2">cultural Commons and eventually what</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.250" end="00:08:21.500" style="s2">happens is people become capable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.699" end="00:08:24.440" style="s2">enacting participatory governance and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.500" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">that is the biggest wealth in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.440" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">commons the Commons then becomes capable</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">of enacting a participatory governance</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.870" end="00:08:45.620" style="s2">so that&#39;s the larger vision of the Opie</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.780" end="00:08:50.510" style="s2">oh and there&#39;s a lot of work to be done</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">between now in this future vision but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.510" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">think it&#39;s exciting and can be really</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:56.170" style="s2">fun</p>
