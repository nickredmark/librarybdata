<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">eventful idea cafe today&#39;s question is</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.259" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">how could we manage conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">within game B and we&#39;ve had things</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:16.460" style="s2">happen within the last 24 hours and make</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">this a little more impertinent today</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.460" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">Tara or Eric do you want to go first or</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.210" style="s2">I could start I don&#39;t mind young for you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">because I&#39;ve actually just written a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.210" end="00:00:29.310" style="s2">fairly lengthy comment about this in in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">the thread that underneath bonito</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.310" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">leaving and I mean I&#39;ve kind of said</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">this before I don&#39;t know if it was an</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">idea cafe or a lot of other other</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">conversations I know I am sorry</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">repeating myself but but nevertheless I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s a point worth making that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">know with the best will in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">even if everybody is earnestly acting in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:49.410" style="s2">good faith you are going to get people</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">run into conflicts just because they</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.410" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">come from different worlds you know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">I mean they have different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:55.350" style="s2">on things and that&#39;s just how it is and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">this should be welcomed as an</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.350" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">opportunity for discovery and not you</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">know not jumped on as a opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">get ourselves into camps and start</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">fighting each other it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">deeply depressing to me and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">think you know in in a community that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">seeks to embody things such as rule</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">Omega you know if you actually try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">live rule Omega not just you know get</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">together and have a rule I make a chat</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">once a fortnight but but I mean actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">try to live it in your life then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">know the the notion of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">resolution is something that is going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">all the time right how to best manage</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">interactions right and and whether that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">is a conflict or whether it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">normal interaction and seeking to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">the most out of it it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">matter the attitude towards it should be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">the same and one final thing on this I I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.380" end="00:01:57.100" style="s2">really strongly feel that if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:58.360" style="s2">find some harmony within a group such as</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.100" end="00:01:59.979" style="s2">this where we&#39;ve all come here</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.360" end="00:02:01.750" style="s2">voluntarily right because we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.979" end="00:02:04.149" style="s2">attracted to the ideas of the group</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.750" end="00:02:05.890" style="s2">rights we&#39;re all on very much on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.149" end="00:02:08.259" style="s2">same team and coming from broadly</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.890" end="00:02:11.500" style="s2">similar perspectives on what the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.259" end="00:02:14.349" style="s2">is like is deeply depressing that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.500" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">witness this kind of fracturing and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.349" end="00:02:18.580" style="s2">infighting I&#39;m in a group such as this</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">is deeply depressing to me that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.580" end="00:02:23.450" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">thank your Kiera do you wanna go or do</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.450" end="00:02:34.430" style="s2">want me to go sure I can go my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:36.620" style="s2">perspective on conflict having grown up</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.430" end="00:02:38.780" style="s2">in game a was that when there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.620" end="00:02:42.950" style="s2">conflict you just tried to get the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.780" end="00:02:45.170" style="s2">person to see your perspective it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.950" end="00:02:47.420" style="s2">there was manipulation or anger or</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.170" end="00:02:49.250" style="s2">whatever you did whatever you could to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.420" end="00:02:52.670" style="s2">figure out how to get the other person</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.250" end="00:02:57.080" style="s2">to see your perspective and for me you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">know conflict in game B is recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.080" end="00:03:01.850" style="s2">that when you have humans living in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:06.770" style="s2">community they have conflicting needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.850" end="00:03:09.980" style="s2">and so and how do you identify and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.770" end="00:03:12.890" style="s2">identify what those needs are and get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.980" end="00:03:15.560" style="s2">and and in some cases you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.890" end="00:03:20.300" style="s2">identifying what the the higher-level</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.560" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">needs are and being able to address</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.300" end="00:03:25.850" style="s2">those and I don&#39;t think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:29.980" style="s2">and to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.850" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">conflict is actually some place where</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.980" end="00:03:37.880" style="s2">there is a lot of opportunity for deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:41.030" style="s2">connection when there is conflict you</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.880" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">can actually come together it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.030" end="00:03:48.140" style="s2">but it&#39;s being able to you know as Eric</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:50.690" style="s2">said practice rule Omega or you know for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.140" end="00:03:53.270" style="s2">me the other way I the other way I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.690" end="00:03:56.330" style="s2">about it is behind every action is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.270" end="00:03:58.030" style="s2">positive intention that even when</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.330" end="00:04:00.350" style="s2">somebody&#39;s doing something that is just</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">like I do not understand in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.350" end="00:04:05.270" style="s2">slightest there is some part of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:07.790" style="s2">that that thinks that if they&#39;re if they</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.270" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">do this they will get a need met and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.790" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">know is attempting to get a need met for</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">them and it might be a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:13.610" style="s2">dysfunctional way of getting their need</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">met</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.610" end="00:04:19.549" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t you know it is a way and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:22.100" style="s2">when I can recognize that you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.549" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">this person&#39;s doing something that does</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.100" end="00:04:26.330" style="s2">not make any sense to me but they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">trying you know they&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.330" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2">just to be an asshole they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:30.729" style="s2">because they&#39;re attempting to get their</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:33.050" style="s2">needs met</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.729" end="00:04:34.490" style="s2">however dysfunctional that may be and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.050" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">being able to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:41.030" style="s2">that perspective into the game be and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">you know limit the amount of labeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.030" end="00:04:49.610" style="s2">and name-calling and and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">how much I can and and limit the number</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.610" end="00:04:54.349" style="s2">of the amount of name-calling labeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">and mind reading and trying to come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.349" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">it from a place of curiosity of how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:03.979" style="s2">you know okay what is life like for you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">and Trust and and coming into the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.979" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">car into a conflict with the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:12.050" style="s2">this person is doing the best that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">can no matter how destructive it might</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.050" end="00:05:15.860" style="s2">be this person is doing the best that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">they can and when I can come in to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.860" end="00:05:23.330" style="s2">conflict with those things it helps me</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:27.169" style="s2">to be able to navigate that and figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.330" end="00:05:29.659" style="s2">out okay how do i how do i walk through</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.169" end="00:05:31.819" style="s2">this and you know i I also was dealing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.659" end="00:05:35.180" style="s2">with conflict yesterday not nearly as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.819" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">fairly minor but you know it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">in some some cases there are times when</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay I know what I know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:42.830" style="s2">this person is going through something</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:44.570" style="s2">at this moment and I&#39;m just gonna let</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:09.220" style="s2">directly so we don&#39;t have to do this on</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.459" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">display for the group right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.220" end="00:12:13.029" style="s2">almost all the time the person doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.149" style="s2">reach out right and that&#39;s fine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.029" end="00:12:17.410" style="s2">reasons they might not want to but most</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.149" end="00:12:19.240" style="s2">of the time there is no third party</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.410" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">around and the types of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.240" end="00:12:25.329" style="s2">preaching that they want uh uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:27.160" style="s2">sense making and mediation and this kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.329" end="00:12:28.839" style="s2">of stuff they&#39;re not doing it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.160" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">just talking about it and they&#39;re mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.839" end="00:12:33.310" style="s2">they&#39;re being very exclusive in the way</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:35.170" style="s2">they behave in the way that they shape</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.310" end="00:12:37.300" style="s2">these communities right they want</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.170" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">somebody like me out but they want</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.300" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">people who are actually saying ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:46.870" style="s2">or racist things in the group and so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:49.779" style="s2">mean I think that&#39;s more ridiculous than</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.870" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">it is offensive to me you know I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.779" end="00:12:54.339" style="s2">to put myself on on trial or whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:57.459" style="s2">kind of get to the facts of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.339" end="00:12:59.709" style="s2">situations and there&#39;s been similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.459" end="00:13:02.709" style="s2">issues in other groups that I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.709" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">not not necessarily because of me but</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.709" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">because of the attitude towards conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">resolution right so mm-hmm of course in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:12.100" style="s2">in all the kind of intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:15.610" style="s2">Facebook groups I participated in and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.100" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">stuff they&#39;re a lot more reactionary and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.610" end="00:13:18.610" style="s2">dismissive if they just don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:20.589" style="s2">want to talk and I kind of expect that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.610" end="00:13:23.529" style="s2">right and bullied at lots of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.589" end="00:13:26.110" style="s2">groups but in the meta modern mailing</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.529" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">list there&#39;s also a couple</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.110" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">Trump supporters and the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:34.839" style="s2">towards that from most of the group is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:36.459" style="s2">to just not engage right to sweep it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.839" end="00:13:40.810" style="s2">under the rug to pretend like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.459" end="00:13:44.019" style="s2">happening mm-hmm um and in the one case</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.810" end="00:13:45.820" style="s2">where conflict resolution was attempted</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.019" end="00:13:47.200" style="s2">with actually one of these people one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.820" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">these Trump supporters who was quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.200" end="00:13:53.800" style="s2">aggressive to me quite reactionary in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:56.920" style="s2">their politics that guy kind of blew up</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.800" end="00:14:00.430" style="s2">blew up and disrupted the the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.920" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">resolution process I wasn&#39;t part of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.430" end="00:14:09.370" style="s2">but I heard mm-hmm sorry let me get my</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:11.500" style="s2">camp back ham mi I heard from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.370" end="00:14:14.010" style="s2">mediator that she was forced to quit</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.500" end="00:14:16.360" style="s2">basically because that that person was</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.010" end="00:14:17.800" style="s2">bullying her and disrupting the process</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.360" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">right so there&#39;s an example of where</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.800" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">conflict resolution was tried I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:23.769" style="s2">even a part of it it was between two</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:27.790" style="s2">other people but it was in response to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.769" end="00:14:29.290" style="s2">an article I wrote mmm and and that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:31.060" style="s2">that whole process blew up and I could</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:33.130" style="s2">have predicted it would have done so</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.060" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">because the person was acting in bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.130" end="00:14:37.089" style="s2">faith and coming from an</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:39.430" style="s2">anti-intellectual place and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.089" end="00:14:41.380" style="s2">recipe for disaster and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.430" end="00:14:44.019" style="s2">that in game B because we put the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.380" end="00:14:46.990" style="s2">protocols and the practices above the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.019" end="00:14:49.779" style="s2">actual facts and kind of theories about</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.990" end="00:14:52.810" style="s2">a social change about politics right</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.779" end="00:14:55.149" style="s2">there&#39;s we all know very transparently</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.810" end="00:14:57.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m talking with Jim about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.149" end="00:15:00.339" style="s2">later today that game B has an adverse</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.940" end="00:15:04.269" style="s2">attitude towards basic concepts like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.339" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">post-modernism Marxism socialism etc</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.269" end="00:15:07.720" style="s2">they just don&#39;t want to engage it they</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:10.600" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.720" end="00:15:11.890" style="s2">controversial right I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.600" end="00:15:14.500" style="s2">problem with confrontation or</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.890" end="00:15:17.110" style="s2">controversy and where where mediation is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.500" end="00:15:19.390" style="s2">offered I will always accept it right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.110" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">we need to get that clear that these</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.390" end="00:15:24.730" style="s2">conflicts can be solved people just not</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:27.160" style="s2">need to not be afraid mm-hmm and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.730" end="00:15:29.140" style="s2">last thing I&#39;ll say you know is that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.160" end="00:15:32.290" style="s2">think this whole thing is is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.140" end="00:15:35.110" style="s2">um not just because like Vinay was</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.290" end="00:15:37.930" style="s2">booted a month ago and and and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.110" end="00:15:39.640" style="s2">whole dramatic affair but people in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.930" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">community people like David full</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.640" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">have been bullying me for two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:47.589" style="s2">years since I&#39;ve been in this community</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.140" end="00:15:49.660" style="s2">and the sole reason is because his whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.589" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">little media empire is built on</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.660" end="00:15:54.250" style="s2">promoting Jordan Peterson and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">intellectual dark web and I and others</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.250" end="00:15:58.630" style="s2">have criticized that from a good place</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:01.060" style="s2">from a good faith rule Omega place and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.630" end="00:16:02.950" style="s2">they don&#39;t like it they refuse to engage</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.060" end="00:16:05.260" style="s2">so the people that have banned me from</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.950" end="00:16:08.140" style="s2">this group like David fuller and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.260" end="00:16:10.540" style="s2">Hall have never spoken to me they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.140" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">they they&#39;re hypocrites they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.540" end="00:16:15.700" style="s2">to unpack these issues and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:21.070" style="s2">has to happen for game B to be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.700" end="00:16:23.940" style="s2">and to succeed I can expect again the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.070" end="00:16:26.829" style="s2">matter how that goes today</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.940" end="00:16:31.089" style="s2">Nolan Mike if we want part I&#39;m you make</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.829" end="00:16:33.070" style="s2">up that where it is and see how the rest</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.089" end="00:16:36.550" style="s2">of the 45 minutes goes because like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.070" end="00:16:40.120" style="s2">intention of this one is to say how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.550" end="00:16:42.850" style="s2">you facilitate conflict resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.120" end="00:16:45.100" style="s2">more of like the abstractness of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.850" end="00:16:49.870" style="s2">right when you have two parties that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.100" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">in conflict how do you then get them to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.870" end="00:16:53.350" style="s2">sit together what if one doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:55.089" style="s2">sit together how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.350" end="00:16:56.560" style="s2">manage that conflict what if there is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.089" end="00:16:58.089" style="s2">is there a process if there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.560" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">process that no one can follow but if</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.089" end="00:17:03.820" style="s2">there is a process to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">those things are happening and then Kira</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.820" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">had a conflict in her life I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">conflict in my life in the last 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:14.199" style="s2">then this very game be one also has</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">played out in the last like 24 hours I</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.199" end="00:17:19.179" style="s2">mean that one was coming I think for</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">months like the I think I was reached</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.179" end="00:17:24.160" style="s2">out to before to ask how you show up in</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.030" end="00:17:27.730" style="s2">this space and I was like on video he</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.160" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">shows up really well he can listen and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.730" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">and be part and that&#39;s where I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:37.809" style="s2">big piece of it for me is the medium</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s that maybe there shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.809" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">typing from people who don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:45.340" style="s2">type and not read through and be like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:48.460" style="s2">okay this is not okay language can we</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.520" end="00:18:03.590" style="s2">it and our thoughts on it and then he</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.640" end="00:18:10.370" style="s2">minutes of watching this guy have much</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:12.320" style="s2">better things to do with my time but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.370" end="00:18:13.910" style="s2">you want to see our marks low marks on</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.350" end="00:18:48.170" style="s2">language was in no way not practicing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.350" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">the Omega Rule he ordered on it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.170" end="00:18:53.930" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t calling him an idiot it</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">wasn&#39;t saying like I guess my question</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.930" end="00:19:01.700" style="s2">is for you Brent like how why can you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:03.350" style="s2">not delete that part of it like why why</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.700" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">does it get to that level with you like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.350" end="00:19:08.870" style="s2">why does that come out in text instead</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:10.700" style="s2">of doing the steel man or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.870" end="00:19:14.150" style="s2">other side is of like okay delete that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.700" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">and put this in the most maybe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.150" end="00:19:20.510" style="s2">make a rule way that I possibly can yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:21.740" style="s2">I do do that a lot you know right I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.510" end="00:19:24.410" style="s2">write a message and then I&#39;ll delete it</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.740" end="00:19:27.170" style="s2">or all or all I&#39;ll cut it you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.410" end="00:19:30.350" style="s2">have it saved and I&#39;ll do it with emails</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.170" end="00:19:31.460" style="s2">too and but in this specific case that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.350" end="00:19:32.870" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.460" end="00:19:34.580" style="s2">because that was a different thread that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.870" end="00:19:37.430" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the one I got booted for but that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.580" end="00:19:40.280" style="s2">thread was that guy David you know just</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.430" end="00:19:42.590" style="s2">being kind of antagonistic and looking</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.280" end="00:19:44.750" style="s2">for looking for a conflict and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.590" end="00:19:46.100" style="s2">misrepresenting our positions right out</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.750" end="00:19:47.660" style="s2">of the gate and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.100" end="00:19:51.380" style="s2">interesting because what I did reply to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:53.030" style="s2">that comment was that you know I said</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.380" end="00:19:53.930" style="s2">I&#39;d seen the video you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.030" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">it&#39;s not new to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.930" end="00:19:58.310" style="s2">um and I&#39;d be happy to like participate</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:19:59.930" style="s2">in an unpacking of that like I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.310" end="00:20:02.690" style="s2">trying to steal an his position and say</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.930" end="00:20:04.100" style="s2">like like yeah I I agree with some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:06.550" style="s2">what this guy is saying like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.100" end="00:20:09.850" style="s2">new but the whole assumption of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.550" end="00:20:11.290" style="s2">host was that you know he was assuming</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.850" end="00:20:17.890" style="s2">we&#39;re just diehard</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.290" end="00:20:19.570" style="s2">I heard communists and sorry okay I got</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.890" end="00:20:22.330" style="s2">thrown here when my video cuts cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.570" end="00:20:26.530" style="s2">have to click a few things to get it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:29.800" style="s2">back yeah so I would have engaged</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.530" end="00:20:31.930" style="s2">further on that particular point but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.800" end="00:20:33.550" style="s2">was just silly and and then I got booted</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.930" end="00:20:35.320" style="s2">but yeah it answer your question you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.550" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">know I do i do censor and limit myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.320" end="00:20:41.410" style="s2">but sometimes if people say things and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:45.460" style="s2">it&#39;s public that need to be responded to</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.410" end="00:20:48.130" style="s2">or called out you know I responded to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.460" end="00:20:50.500" style="s2">him I responded to him and it wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.130" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">that frame it wasn&#39;t calling him names</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.500" end="00:20:57.790" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t it was like yeah I am</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:59.350" style="s2">anti-capitalist you got me yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.790" end="00:21:01.240" style="s2">in this case though it comes from having</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.350" end="00:21:02.920" style="s2">experience with particular people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.240" end="00:21:05.680" style="s2">different contexts right and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.920" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">always kind of a rais&#39;d mm-hmm so in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.680" end="00:21:08.980" style="s2">this case you know we already had</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:11.170" style="s2">context with him from the other threads</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.980" end="00:21:13.090" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same thing for for other</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.170" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">people like like Jordan Hall or David</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.090" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">fuller like they want to completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:19.150" style="s2">erase the context they want to be dicks</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:20.800" style="s2">themselves in the moment and then do</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.150" end="00:21:23.920" style="s2">this gotcha saying if I say something</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.800" end="00:21:26.800" style="s2">stupid or if I swear and it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.920" end="00:21:28.440" style="s2">trivial and so prissy what I&#39;m coming to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.800" end="00:21:31.180" style="s2">this space as a serious person</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.440" end="00:21:33.180" style="s2">volunteering my time you know to help</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.180" end="00:21:35.820" style="s2">people sense make and there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.180" end="00:21:38.230" style="s2">reactionary bullshit going around and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.820" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">and the people that get lynched in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.230" end="00:21:44.410" style="s2">end are people like Vinay Gupta or</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:47.890" style="s2">myself who are ready to put our cards on</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.410" end="00:21:48.340" style="s2">the table and I think the stakes are</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.890" end="00:21:50.350" style="s2">very high</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.340" end="00:21:51.970" style="s2">right so in matters that we push through</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.350" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">instead of just retreating and sweeping</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.970" end="00:21:57.130" style="s2">things under the rug and I cannot just</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.180" end="00:22:02.260" style="s2">interject one one thing at this point</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.130" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">Brent and and it&#39;s hard because and so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.260" end="00:22:07.060" style="s2">just want to preempt it by saying this</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:08.560" style="s2">comes from someone who knows you a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.060" end="00:22:11.560" style="s2">little bit you know what I mean enjoys</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.560" end="00:22:14.380" style="s2">talking to you I have absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.560" end="00:22:16.570" style="s2">problem with you whatsoever however I do</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.380" end="00:22:18.760" style="s2">find when you write stuff even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.570" end="00:22:20.230" style="s2">not actually swearing at someone or</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.760" end="00:22:27.040" style="s2">calling them something or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.230" end="00:22:31.000" style="s2">there is often a tone which I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.040" end="00:22:34.600" style="s2">it has a somewhat dismissive kind of air</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.000" end="00:22:36.070" style="s2">to it to me I mean this is how I intend</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.600" end="00:22:37.720" style="s2">and so if I&#39;m taking it like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.070" end="00:22:44.049" style="s2">reasonable to think that others might</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.720" end="00:22:46.419" style="s2">take it the same way and so I I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.049" end="00:22:52.299" style="s2">that in text you could do a better job</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.419" end="00:22:53.860" style="s2">of cultivating language which is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.299" end="00:22:56.260" style="s2">going to get people&#39;s backs up when they</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.860" end="00:22:59.290" style="s2">read it you know what I mean absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.260" end="00:23:01.570" style="s2">I agree you know this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.290" end="00:23:03.880" style="s2">work on and it&#39;s something that I&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.570" end="00:23:05.380" style="s2">bit of a disadvantage with compared to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.880" end="00:23:07.450" style="s2">other people because you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.380" end="00:23:10.120" style="s2">have full employment I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.450" end="00:23:10.690" style="s2">support network around me in things like</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.120" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.690" end="00:23:15.580" style="s2">so I completely agree but like this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:17.860" style="s2">the hypocrisy of the group these people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.580" end="00:23:19.929" style="s2">have to create the conditions right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.860" end="00:23:22.780" style="s2">you mentioned Bonita Roy leaving I</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.929" end="00:23:24.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t see that but she&#39;s also somebody</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.780" end="00:23:27.429" style="s2">who&#39;s been like this to me right and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.910" end="00:23:28.390" style="s2">i you know i&#39;m showing my cards now i</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.429" end="00:23:31.540" style="s2">don&#39;t care anymore</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.390" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">right she has a problem with me but she</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.540" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the guts to tell me herself</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:36.250" style="s2">and to talk to me so these people talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">to each other behind other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.250" end="00:23:43.540" style="s2">backs and scheme and plan to to boot you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">but at the end of the day it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.540" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">know there&#39;s other places for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s your loss you know so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">gonna keep trying to participate however</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.040" end="00:23:54.970" style="s2">I can you know there&#39;s other game be</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">forums and there&#39;s other things going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.970" end="00:24:02.710" style="s2">like meta modernism and you know coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:04.600" style="s2">from that background uh you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.710" end="00:24:07.809" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna pretend like game B has</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.600" end="00:24:09.429" style="s2">been hospitable to that it&#39;s taken a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.809" end="00:24:11.770" style="s2">long time for things to come together</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.429" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">like for Hansie to go on Jim ruts show</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.770" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">etc right so these things are very slow</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:20.440" style="s2">to unravel and I don&#39;t care about my</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:22.059" style="s2">band right now like I I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.440" end="00:24:25.390" style="s2">bullshit when I was blocked</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.059" end="00:24:29.020" style="s2">I was I was muted for three days with no</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.390" end="00:24:32.860" style="s2">warning and no engagement from the hosts</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.020" end="00:24:34.059" style="s2">I was muted because on my black metal</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.860" end="00:24:35.979" style="s2">modernism thread</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.059" end="00:24:38.649" style="s2">some of these same reaction areas were</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.979" end="00:24:41.080" style="s2">dogpiling on me and saying stupid racist</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.649" end="00:24:42.639" style="s2">shit and I was standing up against it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.080" end="00:24:44.499" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I was muted with you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.639" end="00:24:47.289" style="s2">with no with no warning and no context</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.499" end="00:24:49.989" style="s2">so at this point like there&#39;s conflict</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.289" end="00:24:56.440" style="s2">and you know if they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.989" end="00:24:59.409" style="s2">resolve it I will Brett it similar to</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.440" end="00:25:00.749" style="s2">Eric you know I&#39;ve I&#39;ve enjoyed need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.409" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">know you and having these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.749" end="00:25:08.739" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple of things that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:13.210" style="s2">observe in the conversation that I hear</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.739" end="00:25:16.259" style="s2">you saying that I hear a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.210" end="00:25:19.479" style="s2">name-calling calling people dicks</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.259" end="00:25:22.599" style="s2">putting people in boxes and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.479" end="00:25:25.029" style="s2">hear some mind-reading that they are</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.210" end="00:26:03.309" style="s2">it took us a long time to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.149" end="00:26:05.979" style="s2">to have those and I watched my head you</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.679" end="00:26:32.409" style="s2">people&#39;s intentions were and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.619" end="00:26:34.450" style="s2">hear some assumptions about what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.409" end="00:26:37.509" style="s2">intentions are Jubilee talked was able</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.450" end="00:26:39.669" style="s2">to talk about the the you know this</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.509" end="00:26:42.309" style="s2">other thread and I haven&#39;t ready either</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.669" end="00:26:43.989" style="s2">one but coming into it without making</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.309" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">assumptions about what other people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:53.720" style="s2">and so just again and I&#39;m not someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.299" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">who who is comfortable saying like</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.720" end="00:26:59.510" style="s2">giving people feedback and so this is I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:04.990" style="s2">this is pushing my edge to say that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.510" end="00:27:08.120" style="s2">it&#39;s you know what I hear is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.990" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">yeah especially mind-reading is the is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.120" end="00:27:14.870" style="s2">the part that I hear that I think gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">in the way of being able to have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.870" end="00:27:23.809" style="s2">type of conversations that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:27.710" style="s2">want to have yeah that&#39;s all fine</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.809" end="00:27:31.070" style="s2">you know I welcome criticism and and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.710" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">don&#39;t deny it if it&#39;s true um but but</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.070" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">also like my my central point with with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:37.610" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying and and this this</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.299" style="s2">comes first right the other people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.610" end="00:27:40.400" style="s2">mind-reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.299" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">me right so the people I&#39;ve listed who</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.400" end="00:27:45.530" style="s2">have never engaged me respectfully</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.100" end="00:27:47.750" style="s2">they&#39;ve never reached out they and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.530" end="00:27:50.210" style="s2">are dicks I&#39;m not gonna be passive or</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.750" end="00:27:54.020" style="s2">you know concerned about my use of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.210" end="00:27:57.530" style="s2">term they show up as being a jerk but</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.020" end="00:28:01.309" style="s2">pretending to be a you know diplomat or</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.530" end="00:28:03.289" style="s2">whatever and and we&#39;ve seen groups fall</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.309" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">apart and be torn apart by reactionaries</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.289" end="00:28:07.400" style="s2">before I&#39;ve written about this I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.970" end="00:28:09.559" style="s2">warned about it and in the past month</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.400" end="00:28:11.260" style="s2">the herpes saloon which isn&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.559" end="00:28:14.179" style="s2">which was an integral Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.260" end="00:28:16.340" style="s2">collapsed because of this and I could</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.179" end="00:28:17.750" style="s2">have predicted this a year ago cuz</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.340" end="00:28:19.100" style="s2">because I knew what was going on in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.750" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">group and they wouldn&#39;t even let me in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.100" end="00:28:24.650" style="s2">so you know to go back to your point</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:27.320" style="s2">about mind-reading there is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.650" end="00:28:29.450" style="s2">that depending on the context on my part</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.320" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">meaning that I have to watch out for but</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.450" end="00:28:37.309" style="s2">I&#39;m usually you know I&#39;m not assuming</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:39.470" style="s2">I&#39;m going off of what I know about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.309" end="00:28:41.659" style="s2">person and what they were out right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.470" end="00:28:43.970" style="s2">if people look at the full context and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.659" end="00:28:46.970" style="s2">not just the full context because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.970" end="00:28:48.770" style="s2">not enough they need to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.970" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">was being said what the other person</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.770" end="00:28:53.270" style="s2">actually meant and what I meant right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:56.419" style="s2">that needs to be unpacked you&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.270" end="00:28:59.270" style="s2">lot of that mind-reading all over the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.419" end="00:29:01.880" style="s2">place and my my my central point is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.270" end="00:29:03.710" style="s2">you know it like obviously I have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.880" end="00:29:07.100" style="s2">work on it but the mods have to work on</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.710" end="00:29:09.920" style="s2">it too you know if if they&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.100" end="00:29:12.890" style="s2">top-down thing it&#39;s gonna collapse if</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.920" end="00:29:16.180" style="s2">they are following their own rules it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.890" end="00:29:21.350" style="s2">that simple I guess that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.180" end="00:29:23.720" style="s2">question and the more abstract is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.350" end="00:29:26.510" style="s2">could they have done what would the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.720" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">thing have been because there is a proce</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.510" end="00:29:29.630" style="s2">if there&#39;s a process of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:31.310" style="s2">resolution where okay take it out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.630" end="00:29:33.800" style="s2">here I totally understand the take it</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.310" end="00:29:35.300" style="s2">outside because we all don&#39;t want to see</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.800" end="00:29:37.550" style="s2">it we don&#39;t want to see the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.300" end="00:29:39.290" style="s2">like screaming back and forth at each</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.550" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">other every other Facebook page is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.290" end="00:29:45.140" style="s2">this is supposed to be a place for rule</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.670" style="s2">Omega and so I think that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.140" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">first step to just be like this is out</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.670" end="00:29:51.580" style="s2">of hand stop this right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:53.960" style="s2">and when that doesn&#39;t happen like what</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.580" end="00:29:55.250" style="s2">should there be a way in place to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.960" end="00:29:58.370" style="s2">like okay we&#39;re gonna have a video</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.250" end="00:30:00.500" style="s2">conversation with a you know with</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.370" end="00:30:02.810" style="s2">somebody who can do conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.500" end="00:30:06.530" style="s2">and to parties but then what if one</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.810" end="00:30:09.410" style="s2">party doesn&#39;t want to what if do you do</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.530" end="00:30:11.030" style="s2">that and it&#39;s catastrophic I mean it can</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.410" end="00:30:16.370" style="s2">be that&#39;s kind of what happened with my</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.030" end="00:30:18.230" style="s2">neighbor but very muted if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.370" end="00:30:19.400" style="s2">talking yeah yeah yeah no just saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.230" end="00:30:21.230" style="s2">from what Jubilee was saying there that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.400" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">that feels to me to be a much better</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.230" end="00:30:24.950" style="s2">reason to ban someone from the group</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:26.930" style="s2">they were unwilling to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.950" end="00:30:29.690" style="s2">the conflict resolution process right</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.930" end="00:30:31.400" style="s2">you know there is a process there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.690" end="00:30:32.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a goodwill good-faith process and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.400" end="00:30:36.470" style="s2">if you&#39;re not prepared to engage in it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.840" end="00:30:38.090" style="s2">and you are you know saying horrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.470" end="00:30:40.610" style="s2">things and being disruptive and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.090" end="00:30:43.460" style="s2">and you&#39;re unwilling to even have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.610" end="00:30:45.170" style="s2">conversation about it I would be much</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.460" end="00:30:47.180" style="s2">happier banning people in those</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.170" end="00:30:48.440" style="s2">circumstances than just because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.180" end="00:30:51.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t like what they said or how they</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.440" end="00:30:53.510" style="s2">said it because that becomes someone has</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.050" end="00:30:55.220" style="s2">then has to be arbiter of what we like</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.510" end="00:30:57.170" style="s2">and what we don&#39;t like right and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.220" end="00:30:59.570" style="s2">that always troubles me who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.170" end="00:31:03.830" style="s2">decide is a question that always always</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.570" end="00:31:07.850" style="s2">troubles me so yeah I like that I like</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.830" end="00:31:11.990" style="s2">that there is some kind of when I go</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.850" end="00:31:12.840" style="s2">back to the you know what I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.990" end="00:31:15.419" style="s2">going to see</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.840" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">is that the groups that emerge and are</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.419" end="00:31:21.900" style="s2">able to find stability have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:28.529" style="s2">ratio of friction to conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.900" end="00:31:31.490" style="s2">and this group not necessarily you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.529" end="00:31:34.529" style="s2">there&#39;s practicing rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.490" end="00:31:38.600" style="s2">there&#39;s conflict resolution and and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.529" end="00:31:41.190" style="s2">think there&#39;s maybe in my mind an</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.600" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">assumption that practicing room</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.190" end="00:31:47.159" style="s2">just practicing rule Omega will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">conflict resolution and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.159" end="00:31:53.370" style="s2">necessarily think that that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:56.010" style="s2">case and we don&#39;t necessarily and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.370" end="00:32:06.360" style="s2">seems that in this particular Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.010" end="00:32:10.260" style="s2">group there is a necessarily a people</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.360" end="00:32:12.390" style="s2">who are the equipped to do the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.260" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">resolution that I think people that were</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.390" end="00:32:19.770" style="s2">that that is probably needed in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:23.399" style="s2">have to move through some of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.770" end="00:32:27.299" style="s2">and I think you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.399" end="00:32:29.159" style="s2">amount of like you got a there is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.299" end="00:32:31.649" style="s2">certain amount of you got to fight it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.159" end="00:32:35.789" style="s2">out you know you have to like bring this</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.649" end="00:32:37.230" style="s2">stuff out on the table and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.789" end="00:32:39.149" style="s2">of us there&#39;s a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.230" end="00:32:41.159" style="s2">not comfortable with doing that I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.149" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">one of them at times depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.159" end="00:32:52.370" style="s2">situation and yeah it&#39;s just in its and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:56.789" style="s2">so you know how how would we encourage</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.370" end="00:32:57.929" style="s2">conflict resolution that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.789" end="00:33:01.669" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.929" end="00:33:05.220" style="s2">morning is like how do i how could I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.669" end="00:33:08.210" style="s2">encourage that you know to come forth</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.220" end="00:33:08.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m not entirely sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.379" end="00:33:14.299" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna jump in um just to what Eric</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.919" end="00:33:16.100" style="s2">was saying like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.299" end="00:33:17.720" style="s2">necessarily that other people need to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.100" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">banned either like there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.720" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">definitely reasons to do so but like in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:23.450" style="s2">this case I was encouraging those people</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:27.049" style="s2">to leave the group you know cuz on my</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.450" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">terms I don&#39;t think the anti social</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.049" end="00:33:32.749" style="s2">justice anti sociology attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:35.720" style="s2">healthy or really appropriate right so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.749" end="00:33:38.690" style="s2">so I try to kind of argue for my own</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.720" end="00:33:41.210" style="s2">legitimacy in the group on those terms I</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.690" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">don&#39;t think they should be banned just</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.210" end="00:33:44.119" style="s2">because they&#39;re also saying stupid</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:46.639" style="s2">things mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.119" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">but uh but to go to what Kyra was saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.639" end="00:33:52.519" style="s2">- um you know I think a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:54.440" style="s2">needs to be resolved at a more abstract</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.519" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">level meaning you know going back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.440" end="00:33:57.980" style="s2">something we talked about in the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.019" style="s2">couple weeks on one of these calls is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.980" end="00:34:02.450" style="s2">think we need better briefing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.019" end="00:34:04.429" style="s2">priming on subjects so when the subject</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.450" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">comes up people have some sort of common</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.429" end="00:34:07.669" style="s2">ground and they know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:10.629" style="s2">talking about they&#39;re not to sharing</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.669" end="00:34:13.609" style="s2">random links that are that are easily</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.629" end="00:34:15.799" style="s2">falsifiable or debunk a ball and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.609" end="00:34:17.869" style="s2">that person isn&#39;t willing to engage you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.799" end="00:34:18.889" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s way too much of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.869" end="00:34:22.549" style="s2">that where somebody shares something</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.889" end="00:34:24.970" style="s2">like as if it&#39;s proof and it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.549" end="00:34:27.319" style="s2">creates a deeper argument you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.970" end="00:34:30.919" style="s2">related to this race point like people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.319" end="00:34:34.220" style="s2">are you know sharing articles from quill</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.919" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">at an area and this is just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.220" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">stalk anti social justice position like</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">it&#39;s very well refined but at the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:47.149" style="s2">level its incoherent because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">like they&#39;re correspond to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.149" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">research to your research corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:58.099" style="s2">their come on I&#39;m talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:35:00.140" style="s2">real these aren&#39;t things they&#39;re black</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.099" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">and white they&#39;re not gravity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.140" end="00:35:05.240" style="s2">people&#39;s perceptions and so just I am I</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.760" end="00:35:14.210" style="s2">and have an actual conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.589" end="00:35:17.030" style="s2">care if there&#39;s Trump supporters in game</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.830" end="00:35:27.090" style="s2">step into their shoes and see it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.630" end="00:35:29.100" style="s2">like their perspective and it helps me</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.090" end="00:35:31.620" style="s2">have more compassion for them like there</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.100" end="00:35:35.730" style="s2">isn&#39;t I mean I get annoyed in the games</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.620" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">v-space in more so when people</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.210" end="00:35:50.220" style="s2">and then I can better like I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.890" end="00:35:52.140" style="s2">do your book report and you&#39;re and yet I</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.140" end="00:35:57.480" style="s2">think it was your post Kyra where you</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.480" end="00:36:00.950" style="s2">and I was like yeah I also have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.430" end="00:36:04.650" style="s2">problem with that and someone responded</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.950" end="00:36:07.530" style="s2">with oh you can try these technique I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.650" end="00:36:08.970" style="s2">like I have I&#39;m I know how to remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.530" end="00:36:10.620" style="s2">things I used to know how to remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.970" end="00:36:12.060" style="s2">things it doesn&#39;t work for my brain I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.620" end="00:36:14.610" style="s2">good something stick some things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.060" end="00:36:16.440" style="s2">it was like try it no I don&#39;t need to in</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.610" end="00:36:19.500" style="s2">any way I&#39;m good with my brain the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.440" end="00:36:21.180" style="s2">it is I don&#39;t need to like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.500" end="00:36:22.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s good enough because like</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.180" end="00:36:25.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not ok if you&#39;re if your language</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.710" end="00:36:27.240" style="s2">is I&#39;m good I&#39;m really ok that my brain</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.500" end="00:36:28.440" style="s2">is exactly how it is it took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.240" end="00:36:32.100" style="s2">work to be ok with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.440" end="00:36:34.020" style="s2">but on gold and so like the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.100" end="00:36:35.730" style="s2">all have to know the same things and we</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.020" end="00:36:38.310" style="s2">all have to agree we have to be primed</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.730" end="00:36:41.430" style="s2">so we can agree first that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.310" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">impossible like we can&#39;t is there then</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.430" end="00:36:45.450" style="s2">we have to decide on what that priming</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">is right like what is that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.450" end="00:36:49.470" style="s2">have to like we need the tool then to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.270" style="s2">that to the nth degree we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.470" end="00:36:53.370" style="s2">able to say ok if we&#39;re gonna do sides</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.270" end="00:36:54.990" style="s2">each side puts forth their stuff and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.370" end="00:36:57.120" style="s2">other side looks at it and critiques it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.990" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">and goes through that&#39;s a debate and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.120" end="00:37:01.170" style="s2">like not at game be for debate I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:04.200" style="s2">game be for conversation including</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.170" end="00:37:09.240" style="s2">anyone that feels differently on any or</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.200" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">all topics than I do and so I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.240" end="00:37:13.650" style="s2">able to do that within conflict like</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:15.960" style="s2">without conflict when I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.650" end="00:37:18.810" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s in my body and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.960" end="00:37:21.210" style="s2">deal with it and so I can only control</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.810" end="00:37:23.550" style="s2">myself I can&#39;t control if they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.210" end="00:37:26.550" style="s2">stories up about me I can&#39;t control if</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.550" end="00:37:28.470" style="s2">they&#39;re false on some information I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.550" end="00:37:29.370" style="s2">point them towards it but just like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.470" end="00:37:30.810" style="s2">not going to read what they tell me</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.370" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">they&#39;re probably not going to read it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.810" end="00:37:35.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;ll just read the Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:38.370" style="s2">article no like if you can&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.190" end="00:37:40.890" style="s2">have like tell me why it&#39;s true then I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.370" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">don&#39;t see like have a conversation and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.890" end="00:37:44.940" style="s2">also am more into a video conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.290" end="00:37:48.300" style="s2">because there&#39;s more new lots and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.940" end="00:37:49.470" style="s2">like it&#39;s easier to give people the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.300" end="00:37:50.970" style="s2">benefit of the doubt that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.470" end="00:37:55.350" style="s2">showing up the best way they can on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.970" end="00:38:03.870" style="s2">video then in text and I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.750" end="00:39:34.100" style="s2">and so when I hear you say that what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">the mind-reading that I have of that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.100" end="00:39:38.430" style="s2">you know the right answer and you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">you&#39;re just here to teach everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.430" end="00:39:41.540" style="s2">what that is and again that&#39;s my mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:43.820" style="s2">reading and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.540" end="00:39:47.600" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what come so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.820" end="00:39:50.560" style="s2">this hesitation in me of and and going</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.600" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">back to Jubilees point of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.560" end="00:39:56.230" style="s2">sit and talk with somebody who has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:39:59.180" style="s2">completely different worldview than I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.230" end="00:40:01.880" style="s2">in you you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.180" end="00:40:07.430" style="s2">I oppose you accept me which makes me</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.880" end="00:40:10.820" style="s2">think it&#39;s me I&#39;m really okay I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.430" end="00:40:13.250" style="s2">know I would not say that I am</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.820" end="00:40:16.430" style="s2">anti-capitalist I would say I&#39;m somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.250" end="00:40:19.010" style="s2">who&#39;s definitely has concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.430" end="00:40:21.800" style="s2">capitalism and what cap you know it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.010" end="00:40:23.570" style="s2">about the limitations of what capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.800" end="00:40:26.330" style="s2">is capable of I would definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.570" end="00:40:29.090" style="s2">call myself a socialist I you know I but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.330" end="00:40:32.420" style="s2">I would say that there are aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.090" end="00:40:35.990" style="s2">that that of socialism that I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.420" end="00:40:38.060" style="s2">could be valuable and so it&#39;s this so</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.990" end="00:40:41.240" style="s2">I&#39;m able to be in these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.060" end="00:40:45.110" style="s2">with you guys because I&#39;m not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.240" end="00:40:50.690" style="s2">think my way is right and so like how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.110" end="00:40:52.820" style="s2">we go into these conversations and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.690" end="00:40:55.070" style="s2">and I have to mute myself for just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.820" end="00:41:01.130" style="s2">second because my dog needing some</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.070" end="00:41:04.070" style="s2">attention hold on everyone else is muted</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.130" end="00:41:05.450" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s actually I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.070" end="00:41:07.340" style="s2">Kira was just saying I mean that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.450" end="00:41:09.410" style="s2">right at the very heart of romaker isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.340" end="00:41:11.780" style="s2">it you know what my perspective while it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.410" end="00:41:14.210" style="s2">may be right is never ever ever complete</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.780" end="00:41:17.030" style="s2">right there is always more I can there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.210" end="00:41:19.790" style="s2">and so that sense of I know the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.030" end="00:41:22.010" style="s2">answer and I&#39;m just here to show it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.790" end="00:41:25.060" style="s2">someone else means that there&#39;s no room</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.010" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">for any new learning to take place right</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.060" end="00:41:29.450" style="s2">yeah I mean I I sort of get that sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">sometimes in your in your writing not</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.450" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">not when I&#39;m talking to you Brett but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:35.090" style="s2">your writing I sometimes get that sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:37.130" style="s2">as well that actually your interest is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.090" end="00:41:39.710" style="s2">to win the argument in order me not to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.130" end="00:41:42.050" style="s2">explore not too deep an understanding on</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.710" end="00:41:44.300" style="s2">both sides but to show them that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.050" end="00:41:47.330" style="s2">are wrong and that this is a better way</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.300" end="00:41:49.070" style="s2">to look at it is it is is kind of how it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.330" end="00:41:51.500" style="s2">feels sometimes again to me I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.070" end="00:41:54.590" style="s2">can&#39;t speak beyond me but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.500" end="00:41:55.829" style="s2">that&#39;s Kira also so yeah maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.590" end="00:41:58.680" style="s2">something there</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.829" end="00:42:00.329" style="s2">I mean you did actually verbalize it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.680" end="00:42:02.189" style="s2">this conversation and go back and watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.329" end="00:42:04.109" style="s2">it but you&#39;re like I&#39;m it I&#39;m giving of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.189" end="00:42:06.239" style="s2">my time to help other people make no</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.109" end="00:42:08.549" style="s2">which is very different than like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.239" end="00:42:10.469" style="s2">here to make sense of it yeah I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.549" end="00:42:12.569" style="s2">here to learn right don&#39;t don&#39;t get me</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.469" end="00:42:14.069" style="s2">wrong like like I stand by I stand by</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.569" end="00:42:15.869" style="s2">what I said but that&#39;s only half of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.069" end="00:42:18.829" style="s2">equation like I&#39;m here to learn too and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.869" end="00:42:24.930" style="s2">I learn Lots from different people but</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.829" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">in my in the way I argue with people or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.930" end="00:42:30.329" style="s2">show up here or show open my articles</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:31.439" style="s2">especially the articles especially I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.329" end="00:42:33.449" style="s2">not necessarily trying to win an</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.439" end="00:42:35.699" style="s2">argument a lot of issues I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.449" end="00:42:37.289" style="s2">show like I&#39;m trying to transcend the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.699" end="00:42:39.390" style="s2">argument kind of transcend the debate</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.289" end="00:42:41.699" style="s2">right because a lot of conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.390" end="00:42:44.969" style="s2">debates are kind of contrived right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.699" end="00:42:47.699" style="s2">they&#39;re politicized right so they they</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.969" end="00:42:50.309" style="s2">mobilize a lot of people towards you</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.699" end="00:42:52.289" style="s2">know polarizing on that issue right</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.309" end="00:42:54.599" style="s2">whether it&#39;s immigration or abortion or</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.289" end="00:42:56.849" style="s2">gun rights or whatever the political</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.599" end="00:42:58.859" style="s2">discourse is all messed up right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.849" end="00:43:01.619" style="s2">not coming and saying like look these</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.859" end="00:43:03.929" style="s2">are all the right answers X Y Z it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.619" end="00:43:06.349" style="s2">more like look let&#39;s disentangle and D</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.929" end="00:43:08.819" style="s2">politicize this let&#39;s look at some</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.349" end="00:43:11.400" style="s2">answers we&#39;ve known her true for a long</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.819" end="00:43:13.969" style="s2">time you know like like gun control</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.400" end="00:43:16.380" style="s2">works like it worked in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.969" end="00:43:19.140" style="s2">legalizing drugs works like it worked in</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.380" end="00:43:21.660" style="s2">Portugal like let&#39;s D politicize and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.140" end="00:43:24.059" style="s2">depolarize these issues because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.660" end="00:43:27.079" style="s2">them are already solved right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.059" end="00:43:29.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of contentious issues that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.079" end="00:43:32.249" style="s2">sociologists have been a political</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.339" end="00:43:34.170" style="s2">scientists or historians social</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.249" end="00:43:35.640" style="s2">scientists in general of unique</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.170" end="00:43:38.069" style="s2">perspective and ability to cut through</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.640" end="00:43:42.329" style="s2">if people are interested in learning</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.069" end="00:43:45.209" style="s2">right mm-hmm but what happens in these</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.329" end="00:43:47.609" style="s2">spaces I think is you have a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.209" end="00:43:49.859" style="s2">lot of thought leaders and a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.609" end="00:43:51.029" style="s2">the degradation of the signal even</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.859" end="00:43:55.140" style="s2">though that&#39;s the very thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.029" end="00:43:56.759" style="s2">trying to preserve and so he you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.140" end="00:43:59.789" style="s2">just to come back to what I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.759" end="00:44:03.299" style="s2">I&#39;m here to learn for sure and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.789" end="00:44:05.130" style="s2">here to you know to tell people if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.299" end="00:44:06.900" style="s2">spent 10 years studying something and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.130" end="00:44:09.420" style="s2">they&#39;ve never even taken a class on</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.900" end="00:44:11.190" style="s2">social justice maybe there is a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.420" end="00:44:13.710" style="s2">you know differential that we should</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.190" end="00:44:15.569" style="s2">respect there and you know tamaak tum&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.710" end="00:44:17.549" style="s2">berger calls this dynamic subordination</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.569" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">like we&#39;re supposed to do that when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.549" end="00:44:21.260" style="s2">recognize the authority and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:25.349" style="s2">else if that person&#39;s Authority is is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.260" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">somewhat fraudulent you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.349" end="00:44:30.630" style="s2">like Trump like then we can then we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.380" end="00:44:32.940" style="s2">discredit or ignore what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.630" end="00:44:35.010" style="s2">because we have grounds to do so but</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.940" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">there&#39;s this you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.010" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">everybody understands on some level</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:41.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this erosion of trust in society</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:45.089" style="s2">so we don&#39;t know what experts to trust</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.880" end="00:44:48.660" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of people out there on</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.089" end="00:44:52.109" style="s2">the kind of the front of the wave so to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.660" end="00:44:53.880" style="s2">speak that that are still just moderates</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.109" end="00:44:56.130" style="s2">and centrists and collecting huge</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.880" end="00:44:57.690" style="s2">paychecks to just sort of like keep the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.130" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">status quo going you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.690" end="00:45:05.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of equivocation and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:07.589" style="s2">of just avoiding the issues and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.970" end="00:45:11.069" style="s2">people talking outside of their</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.589" end="00:45:14.750" style="s2">expertise this is like avoiding the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.069" end="00:45:17.910" style="s2">issue is often is avoiding conflict like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.750" end="00:45:19.589" style="s2">to be in every space all the time being</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.910" end="00:45:21.299" style="s2">like we inch our racism and sexism and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.589" end="00:45:23.099" style="s2">homophobia on this and it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.299" end="00:45:23.790" style="s2">not necessarily what this moments for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.099" end="00:45:26.309" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the some of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.790" end="00:45:29.190" style="s2">discussion is for as much as those are</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.309" end="00:45:31.730" style="s2">great ideals to live towards we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.190" end="00:45:34.349" style="s2">get to Gainey without dealing with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.730" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">we also can&#39;t deal with them constantly</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.349" end="00:45:39.660" style="s2">like if every conversation can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">about that every like we only have so</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.660" end="00:45:43.740" style="s2">much time and so much energy to devote</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">to conversations and some people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.740" end="00:45:48.420" style="s2">comfortable having those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.740" style="s2">and so I mean I have this question that</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.420" end="00:45:53.460" style="s2">it kind of comes up in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.740" end="00:45:55.349" style="s2">resolution which is like if you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.460" end="00:45:57.390" style="s2">something you hold strongly to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.349" end="00:46:00.270" style="s2">vegan your Christian your whatever that</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.270" end="00:46:05.369" style="s2">that people do the opposite right like</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:14.970" style="s2">you just turn somebody off of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.990" end="00:46:17.910" style="s2">mission because you were so forceful</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.970" end="00:46:19.530" style="s2">with it is that on the person or is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.910" end="00:46:21.059" style="s2">on you and so because it&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.530" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">people who are like no I but I just need</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.280" end="00:46:34.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like reverse televangelism or</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:36.829" style="s2">something like it&#39;s how and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.730" end="00:46:38.270" style="s2">happens a lot in like it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.829" end="00:46:40.750" style="s2">associated conflict resolution but it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.270" end="00:46:43.849" style="s2">also is it&#39;s like deal with my issue</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:45.800" style="s2">right now it&#39;s like and not everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.849" end="00:46:48.460" style="s2">is about your issue all the time so how</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.800" end="00:46:52.940" style="s2">do we find how do we show up as we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.460" end="00:46:55.700" style="s2">not necessarily infiltrate the space</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.940" end="00:46:58.220" style="s2">with our energy you don&#39;t like put our</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.700" end="00:47:00.829" style="s2">conflict on everyone else and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.220" end="00:47:02.810" style="s2">like take it outside effectively so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.829" end="00:47:05.300" style="s2">you can actually resolve conflict</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.810" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">because if we can&#39;t do within game B or</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.300" end="00:47:09.859" style="s2">really not be able to create game B</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:13.069" style="s2">mm-hmm just go back to what Brent was</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.859" end="00:47:14.540" style="s2">saying about expertise because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.069" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">valid point you&#39;re making right if</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.540" end="00:47:17.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve spent 10 years studying something</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:19.609" style="s2">and someone else has you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.960" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">read one article whatever in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.609" end="00:47:24.109" style="s2">Economist or something then you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">undoubtedly your expertise exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.109" end="00:47:28.099" style="s2">theirs and in a sense they should listen</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">to you I get what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.099" end="00:47:32.480" style="s2">but in order to establish that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:33.950" style="s2">credibility in the minds of other people</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.480" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.950" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">they don&#39;t know you anyone can say</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:39.560" style="s2">they&#39;ve studied this for 10 years right</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">I mean yeah they don&#39;t actually know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.560" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">know they&#39;ve not seen the work you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.460" end="00:47:47.000" style="s2">you know what I mean and so they just</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.319" end="00:47:48.680" style="s2">just you saying I&#39;ve studied this for 10</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.000" end="00:47:49.910" style="s2">years and you haven&#39;t does not make them</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.680" end="00:47:52.300" style="s2">want to listen to you right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.910" end="00:47:54.280" style="s2">establish that credibility through</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.819" end="00:48:04.819" style="s2">you&#39;ve said there is not quite right</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.260" end="00:48:06.740" style="s2">it&#39;s better framed in this language</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.819" end="00:48:08.210" style="s2">something like that that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.740" end="00:48:11.510" style="s2">you know little guiding things rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.210" end="00:48:13.880" style="s2">than based on my 10 years of study this</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.510" end="00:48:14.960" style="s2">is what I&#39;ve learned and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.880" end="00:48:16.430" style="s2">difference between these two things</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.960" end="00:48:18.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to establish that credibility</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.500" end="00:48:22.490" style="s2">of your audience and and that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.869" end="00:48:24.740" style="s2">trust issue and Trust is built</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.490" end="00:48:26.930" style="s2">bit by bit layer by layer like a brick</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.740" end="00:48:29.140" style="s2">wall over time right</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.930" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">I was thinking along those same lines</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.140" end="00:48:36.440" style="s2">you know I I have a a fairly deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:39.170" style="s2">distrust of Western medicine at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.440" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">point it&#39;s just it&#39;s not serve me well</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.170" end="00:48:53.630" style="s2">in my life and so my trust of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:55.309" style="s2">is not like I I&#39;m it&#39;s I&#39;m I&#39;m deeply</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.309" end="00:49:00.289" style="s2">tells me that they&#39;re an expert if on</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.950" end="00:49:02.839" style="s2">the other hand they take the time to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.289" end="00:49:07.250" style="s2">build the trust with me and want to meet</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.839" end="00:49:09.470" style="s2">me where I am and understand what my</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.890" end="00:49:25.490" style="s2">back to the you know there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.010" end="00:49:28.369" style="s2">more neuroscience that is that says</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.490" end="00:49:32.990" style="s2">humans make decisions based on emotions</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.369" end="00:49:36.529" style="s2">and justify them with logic and so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.990" end="00:49:40.099" style="s2">know when people are having that strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.529" end="00:49:43.069" style="s2">response even to a even it to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.099" end="00:49:48.470" style="s2">who you know on paper is an expert there</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.069" end="00:49:51.680" style="s2">if I don&#39;t trust somebody I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.470" end="00:49:55.640" style="s2">listen you know I I think that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.680" end="00:49:57.349" style="s2">is there to and and I will even if</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.640" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">somebody is even if I think someone&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.349" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">expert if I think they&#39;re there to prove</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:07.069" style="s2">me wrong there I hate I hate this aspect</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">of myself but there&#39;s almost the part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.069" end="00:50:10.339" style="s2">me that&#39;s like fine if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:13.880" style="s2">gonna prove me wrong I&#39;m gonna fight</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.339" end="00:50:16.010" style="s2">with you just because you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.880" end="00:50:19.460" style="s2">that resistance and so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.010" end="00:50:23.329" style="s2">element of working with human nature I</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.460" end="00:50:26.329" style="s2">guess as it is of like humans are highly</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.329" end="00:50:30.049" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not particularly rational</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.329" end="00:50:33.170" style="s2">creatures make decisions you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.049" end="00:50:36.589" style="s2">impulsively and based on emotion and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.170" end="00:50:38.200" style="s2">know and it doesn&#39;t matter you know I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.589" end="00:50:40.950" style="s2">mean I think our political discourse</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.200" end="00:50:43.790" style="s2">proves that it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.950" end="00:50:48.420" style="s2">how many facts you present somebody with</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.790" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">if it if it it if even if those if those</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.420" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">facts feel unsafe people were rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">them and so how do we you know so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:58.050" style="s2">conflict this is all very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.150" style="s2">for cup for the conversation of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.050" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">resolution because it is you know being</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.150" end="00:51:07.170" style="s2">able to resolve conflict involves how</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:11.630" style="s2">much you trust someone else how much you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.170" end="00:51:15.960" style="s2">are and there&#39;s you know and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.630" end="00:51:19.829" style="s2">level you know it&#39;s like I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.960" end="00:51:22.050" style="s2">right had I had had a had this thing</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.640" end="00:51:26.760" style="s2">interact out have been like yep I</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.760" end="00:51:31.349" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that but now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.309" end="00:51:34.109" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of me that says you know</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.490" end="00:51:49.170" style="s2">me that you&#39;re willing to listen but if</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.160" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting you know yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.369" end="00:52:15.180" style="s2">and given the breakdown in cultural</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.180" end="00:52:24.359" style="s2">how do we rebuild that trust it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.500" end="00:52:26.099" style="s2">it went before a cure talk about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.359" end="00:52:28.859" style="s2">what I was gonna say like doctors are</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.099" end="00:52:31.619" style="s2">the experts in our society everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.859" end="00:52:32.970" style="s2">like like even if I know but go talk to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.619" end="00:52:35.460" style="s2">a doctor first regs I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.970" end="00:52:38.700" style="s2">legally responsible and anyone who&#39;s had</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.700" end="00:52:41.520" style="s2">something for my doctorate interaction</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.260" end="00:52:43.049" style="s2">with doctors gets to the point where</p>

<p begin="00:53:22.020" end="00:53:27.090" style="s2">part of the conflict is society trusts</p>

<p begin="00:53:48.480" end="00:53:51.870" style="s2">curve of like you figure out everything</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.890" end="00:53:53.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t know and so if you think you</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.130" end="00:53:57.780" style="s2">the topic you&#39;re probably not like every</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.970" end="00:54:12.780" style="s2">researching like I&#39;ve spent hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.620" end="00:54:16.320" style="s2">hours researching you&#39;re not gonna do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.780" end="00:54:17.940" style="s2">so yes how do we put and I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.560" end="00:54:23.490" style="s2">in the higher institutions that we used</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.060" end="00:54:25.650" style="s2">to and so I need access to medical</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.700" end="00:54:39.060" style="s2">could be like yes but my neurologist</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.810" end="00:54:41.220" style="s2">said this and my neurosurgeon said this</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.060" end="00:54:43.830" style="s2">and my oncologist said this and you guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.220" end="00:54:45.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t agreed this is really annoying</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.830" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">and this person diagnosed me and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.360" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">undiagnosed me and it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:52.440" style="s2">together and decide and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">people who have the same condition can</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.440" end="00:54:57.390" style="s2">be like well no exercise is poison stop</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.730" style="s2">trying to kill us like we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.390" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">the experts on this listen to us and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.730" end="00:55:03.600" style="s2">every time there&#39;s like that power</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">dynamic in the room of like patient</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.600" end="00:55:07.720" style="s2">doctor it&#39;s like yes and I&#39;m bringing</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.720" end="00:55:11.860" style="s2">like there are ways to create the tools</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.310" end="00:55:13.720" style="s2">that we actually can see more of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.860" end="00:55:17.620" style="s2">gray area that nothing&#39;s black-and-white</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.720" end="00:55:19.330" style="s2">like okay I guess I all of my doctors</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.620" end="00:55:20.860" style="s2">have done what they&#39;ve done does it make</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.330" end="00:55:25.840" style="s2">me trust the next one anymore in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.860" end="00:55:27.250" style="s2">makes me trust the glass very quick</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.840" end="00:55:30.430" style="s2">thought brain I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.250" end="00:55:32.170" style="s2">up for doing this but in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.430" end="00:55:35.410" style="s2">conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.170" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">I wonder if an approach to the admins</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.410" end="00:55:41.290" style="s2">along the lines of I recognize that at</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:44.110" style="s2">times the language I use is you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.290" end="00:55:46.270" style="s2">sometimes whatever configurational you</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.110" end="00:55:50.020" style="s2">know sorry confrontational and and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.270" end="00:55:51.730" style="s2">and less than helpful however you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.020" end="00:55:52.810" style="s2">think there is some merit to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.730" end="00:55:54.340" style="s2">that you know I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.810" end="00:55:56.620" style="s2">somewhat ganged up on at times in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.340" end="00:56:00.400" style="s2">group as well can we have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.620" end="00:56:03.640" style="s2">you know out in the open on video as you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.400" end="00:56:05.350" style="s2">know as perhaps the the modeling of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.640" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">beginning of a conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.350" end="00:56:08.320" style="s2">process within game B would you be</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:10.240" style="s2">willing to make such an approach you</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.320" end="00:56:12.910" style="s2">know humble yourself with knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.240" end="00:56:16.990" style="s2">where you&#39;ve been in the wrong and seek</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.910" end="00:56:19.120" style="s2">to see towbar process absolutely because</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.990" end="00:56:20.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s not something like that is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.120" end="00:56:22.660" style="s2">comfortable for me right there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.800" end="00:56:24.580" style="s2">huge incentive but this is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.660" end="00:56:27.550" style="s2">been advocating for for three years</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.580" end="00:56:30.010" style="s2">right instead of mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.550" end="00:56:32.260" style="s2">egotistical people you know pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.010" end="00:56:34.450" style="s2">their own agenda like let&#39;s have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.260" end="00:56:36.910" style="s2">inclusive out their conversations like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.450" end="00:56:39.540" style="s2">nothing bothers me more in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.910" end="00:56:43.840" style="s2">sense making space and political moment</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.540" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">then you know the intellectual darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.840" end="00:56:49.990" style="s2">pretending that they&#39;re the vanguard and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:52.000" style="s2">they&#39;re having like dangerous honest</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.990" end="00:56:54.370" style="s2">conversations when they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.000" end="00:56:57.370" style="s2">avoiding their their leftist critics and</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.370" end="00:57:00.340" style="s2">and so on so like I totally submit to</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.370" end="00:57:02.410" style="s2">those processes and I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.340" end="00:57:05.830" style="s2">good for everyone everything you guys</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.410" end="00:57:09.160" style="s2">were saying he was true and useful in an</p>

<p begin="00:57:09.160" end="00:57:16.470" style="s2">helps us help salute all of us forward I</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.180" end="00:57:16.470" style="s2">think what was the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.260" end="00:57:23.880" style="s2">I forget what I was gonna mmm</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:36.920" style="s2">fair enough we usually do this after we</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.720" end="00:57:38.630" style="s2">stop recording and actually we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.920" end="00:57:40.730" style="s2">stopped doing it because every we just</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.630" end="00:57:42.230" style="s2">post all of them they&#39;re all public but</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.730" end="00:57:45.370" style="s2">I think for this one in particular it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.230" end="00:57:47.630" style="s2">good to have this conversation on camera</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.370" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">are we okay with posting the ck-mb</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.630" end="00:57:51.380" style="s2">because I think that it could actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:53.150" style="s2">be a helpful conversation but if</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.380" end="00:57:54.950" style="s2">anyone&#39;s not okay with it then you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.150" end="00:57:58.430" style="s2">either not post it there and just leave</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.950" end="00:58:00.680" style="s2">it unlisted or private or no absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.430" end="00:58:02.140" style="s2">okay with that I agree with it I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.680" end="00:58:05.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.140" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">all right instead anyone have any we</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.450" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">have like two more minutes left</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.820" end="00:58:46.070" style="s2">beyond the voting thing was I do think</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.360" end="00:58:48.380" style="s2">although conflict resolution is really</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.070" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">important and that that conflict to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.380" end="00:58:52.490" style="s2">coccyx resolution ratio is also</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:54.470" style="s2">important I think one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.490" end="00:58:56.510" style="s2">important things to get to game B is how</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.470" end="00:58:59.510" style="s2">to figure out how to be in conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.510" end="00:59:01.850" style="s2">each other without resolution and get</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.510" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">there like if we need everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.850" end="00:59:05.720" style="s2">kumbaya get along it&#39;s never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:07.220" style="s2">happen whereas if we can figure out okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.720" end="00:59:09.110" style="s2">these two people don&#39;t get along the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.220" end="00:59:10.940" style="s2">conflict resolution is great let&#39;s see</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.940" end="00:59:14.000" style="s2">they never get along and we keep them at</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.290" end="00:59:16.430" style="s2">separate tables maybe they can both be</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.000" end="00:59:17.780" style="s2">part of it and be and the existing</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.430" end="00:59:19.850" style="s2">social media isn&#39;t designed for that</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.780" end="00:59:21.770" style="s2">it&#39;s just blocking and it&#39;s not designed</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.850" end="00:59:24.470" style="s2">to have video chats and see people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.140" end="00:59:30.560" style="s2">of requests where people can post just a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.210" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">five-minute video so they could kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.560" end="00:59:33.650" style="s2">participate in this without having to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:35.330" style="s2">participate at this exact time so we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.650" end="00:59:37.610" style="s2">see each other and connect to each</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.330" end="00:59:38.380" style="s2">other&#39;s humanity of like here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.610" end="00:59:39.700" style="s2">game B means to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.380" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re all gonna answer the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.700" end="00:59:42.460" style="s2">question every week so go and check that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">out at the eye</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.460" end="00:59:47.410" style="s2">I remember what I was gonna say and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:49.360" style="s2">just wouldn&#39;t know how quickly because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.410" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">think it&#39;s important um what I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.360" end="00:59:53.830" style="s2">saying earlier about expertise</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:55.780" style="s2">I didn&#39;t mean to kind of fetishize the</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.830" end="01:00:01.630" style="s2">concept because everything you guys said</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.780" end="01:00:03.910" style="s2">was proper critique and so like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.630" end="01:00:05.590" style="s2">getting at is there&#39;s a lot of experts</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.910" end="01:00:07.360" style="s2">out there that we have to debunk too and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.590" end="01:00:08.560" style="s2">and I can relate to the doctor thing -</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.360" end="01:00:11.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to deal with lots of doctors</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.560" end="01:00:13.060" style="s2">that I think we&#39;re negligent you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.530" end="01:00:18.100" style="s2">given given their position and their</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.060" end="01:00:19.690" style="s2">income in society but like the way in</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.100" end="01:00:23.410" style="s2">which I&#39;m an expert is also as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.690" end="01:00:25.360" style="s2">generalist not necessarily as choosing a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.410" end="01:00:27.610" style="s2">particular expertise on one topic right</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.360" end="01:00:31.060" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s relevant here because</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.610" end="01:00:32.320" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of my own limits as an expert</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.060" end="01:00:35.410" style="s2">on certain topics and will be quick to</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.320" end="01:00:38.430" style="s2">defer to other experts if I can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.410" end="01:00:42.100" style="s2">vet them and say and you know use my</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.430" end="01:00:44.020" style="s2">epistemology - to use a word that Kira</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.100" end="01:00:46.990" style="s2">is interested in now</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.020" end="01:00:48.610" style="s2">to understand that that scholar and why</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.990" end="01:00:50.410" style="s2">they come up with their position right</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.610" end="01:00:52.150" style="s2">so so I can take a sort of meta</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.410" end="01:00:55.210" style="s2">perspective even if I&#39;m not as much of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.150" end="01:00:56.680" style="s2">an expert on the topic as them right so</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.210" end="01:00:59.470" style="s2">I just want to make that clear like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.680" end="01:01:01.600" style="s2">not fetishizing expertise here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.470" end="01:01:05.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more nuanced argument</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.600" end="01:01:10.090" style="s2">behind that but but it&#39;s I think you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.110" end="01:01:11.590" style="s2">had good critiques yeah I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.090" end="01:01:13.240" style="s2">mistake to think that conflict</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.590" end="01:01:14.800" style="s2">resolution necessarily results in</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.240" end="01:01:16.690" style="s2">agreement I agree with orgy but he was</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.800" end="01:01:18.340" style="s2">saying though I mean resolution if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.690" end="01:01:19.960" style="s2">use the word in terms of zooming in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.340" end="01:01:22.450" style="s2">zooming out right then conflict</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.960" end="01:01:25.360" style="s2">resolution is drilling down until you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.450" end="01:01:27.940" style="s2">get to the true nature of what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.360" end="01:01:30.610" style="s2">conflict is right everybody understands</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.940" end="01:01:32.110" style="s2">you know why the other ones pissed off</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.610" end="01:01:33.820" style="s2">whatever right but everyone actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.110" end="01:01:36.970" style="s2">understands what it is actually all</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.820" end="01:01:38.320" style="s2">about and if the result of that is all</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.970" end="01:01:39.550" style="s2">right we just can&#39;t play with each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.320" end="01:01:41.380" style="s2">then fair enough you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.550" end="01:01:43.090" style="s2">but but it&#39;s but it&#39;s done and we know</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.380" end="01:01:44.380" style="s2">that now right and you just don&#39;t play</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.090" end="01:01:46.870" style="s2">with each other anymore if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.380" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">resolution to the conflict then so be it</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.870" end="01:01:49.630" style="s2">but so I absolutely agree it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:51.660" style="s2">need necessarily result in agreement</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.630" end="01:01:55.140" style="s2">that that is that is a bit whew</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.660" end="01:01:58.890" style="s2">the other thing I wanted to say was that</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.140" end="01:02:02.039" style="s2">do you hit it anyway Jubilee was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.890" end="01:02:03.269" style="s2">ratio of friction to conflict resolution</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.039" end="01:02:05.489" style="s2">that the groups that survive are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.269" end="01:02:07.259" style="s2">ones that find their the proper balance</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.489" end="01:02:10.199" style="s2">between these two things right and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.259" end="01:02:11.969" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s absolutely right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.199" end="01:02:18.449" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s all I have to say in</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.969" end="01:02:22.519" style="s2">conclusion you know I echo what everyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.449" end="01:02:26.789" style="s2">else has said and I think the you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.519" end="01:02:29.699" style="s2">specifically being able to can I be in</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.789" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">relationship with someone who has a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.699" end="01:02:35.519" style="s2">different worldview than I do and can I</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:36.900" style="s2">be okay can I be comfortable you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.519" end="01:02:39.930" style="s2">it&#39;s can I be comfortable with being</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.900" end="01:02:42.749" style="s2">uncomfortable because then I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.930" end="01:02:46.229" style="s2">change your I can&#39;t change your mind and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.749" end="01:02:50.279" style="s2">you can&#39;t change my mind and can we</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.229" end="01:02:53.609" style="s2">still be in relationship and I think at</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.279" end="01:02:56.579" style="s2">the heart of how we manage conflict and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.609" end="01:02:59.069" style="s2">game B is how do we manage relationships</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.579" end="01:03:02.359" style="s2">and how do we be in relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.069" end="01:03:05.219" style="s2">each other even when we don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.359" end="01:03:06.719" style="s2">absolutely all right and I just will</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.219" end="01:03:08.819" style="s2">Eric this talking about this vision of</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.719" end="01:03:10.529" style="s2">like compare it be like we can&#39;t play</p>
