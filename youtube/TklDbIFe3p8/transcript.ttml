<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">I was gonna start with my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.250" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">because that seemed like the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">logical place to start but it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">Mother&#39;s Day on the weekend so instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:31.890" style="s2">I&#39;m going to read this thing I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">about being a mom yesterday it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.890" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">notes I&#39;m growing up I thought I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">get married and have four kids two of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">each of the binary genders then they</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">would grow up and repeat that process so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:45.270" style="s2">I would have grandbabies</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">spoiler alert that&#39;s not it&#39;s not what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.270" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">happening motherhood was my first</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">intentional step off the prescribed path</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">and now I&#39;m lost in the woods it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">very feminine or girly girl I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">been a nurturer I played with dolls even</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:02.370" style="s2">when there were no dolls around to play</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">with like treating cars as dolls I also</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">treated my animals like babies I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">always wanted to be a mom I was in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">two-and-a-half year relationship with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">man who was on the fence about ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">having babies I felt a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">depression and once I knew it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">related did not mean a mother I had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">take action I told him I was having a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">baby and he needed to decide if it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:24.619" style="s2">gonna be with him or not</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">he chose not looking back I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.619" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">finding a man for which to have babies</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">with was my only incentive to date I did</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:33.750" style="s2">not want to start that process over</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">again and so I found a donor and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.750" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">baby on my own and that&#39;s a whole saga</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">of itself but we&#39;re not really gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">into today her birth a cesarean in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">end was my first experience showing me</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">that motherhood is never gonna go as</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">planned but it will be both hard and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">beautiful in its own process she has</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">taught me what love is this sweet</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">ever-present ache in my chest not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">angel singing from on high like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">thought it was gonna be it&#39;s more subtle</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">and more profound falling in love with</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">her I could not help but also fall in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">love with myself since she has so much</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.880" end="00:02:34.780" style="s2">blessed to get a glimpse into the real</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:36.610" style="s2">and chaotic messy lives of other parents</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.780" end="00:02:39.520" style="s2">not just the perfectly presented lives</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.730" style="s2">or that my child was being a nuisance I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:11.260" style="s2">had to get over that the other person</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.730" end="00:04:12.609" style="s2">can stop the interaction if they want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.260" end="00:04:14.530" style="s2">just like if they were talking to an</p>
