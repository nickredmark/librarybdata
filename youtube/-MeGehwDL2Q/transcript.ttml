<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">so my</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:10.559" style="s2">wife has been visiting her sister in l.a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:21.920" style="s2">for a couple weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.880" end="00:00:21.920" style="s2">and uh i miss her so much</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.680" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been finding myself feeling so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">deeply appreciative of her</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">i&#39;m normally really appreciative of her</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">but there&#39;s a way where she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:47.840" style="s2">been so present in my aloneness</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">to tell you man there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:53.199" style="s2">different kinds of alone</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:55.360" style="s2">and not all of them are pleasant for</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.199" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">in fact i would say there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">which being alone</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">one can really something about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">spaciousness</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">of being alone</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">that somehow probably makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">room for the character</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:18.400" style="s2">i would say probably of all experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.400" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">you have these</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">multiple horizons</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.320" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">these multiple apprehensions</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">and i think one of the things i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">so appreciative with</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">my wife</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">is that part of what&#39;s made this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">two weeks for me so awesome</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">is the way in which she&#39;s been here</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">by that there&#39;s i guess in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:12.160" style="s2">i guess in some way i know musicians</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">talk about this that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.160" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">music is all about conditioning the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">silence</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">that the music is actually shaping</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">the silent note</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">and i think i&#39;m appreciating the music</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">of her end of our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">and who she is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">to me and who she is for us</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">and in some way in a very primary way</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">i can feel it as animating</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">the way the solitude is present for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">for example you know if say</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">we were in a fight or the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">was not working</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">like she went away and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">we were mad at each other or something</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">i imagine it&#39;d be a very different alone</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">so i think in a lot of ways i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">present through her absence of how</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">grateful i am</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">to be able to be someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">and which i so thoroughly enjoy spending</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">time with on myself is as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">a function of her as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">is of anything about me</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">so i guess in some way</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">like every moment is filled with these</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">horizons of anticipation of all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">things that the sense of what could</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">the talos of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">what&#39;s likely to happen all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">things that i probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">actually need to even represent in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">mind but live</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">horizon</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">that reveals itself as the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">as the mood that attunes</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">the very being of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">is</p>
