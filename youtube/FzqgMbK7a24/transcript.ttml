<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">zero and I had this sort of jujitsu it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">all into something productive and and I</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">people who are gonna be best at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">game aren&#39;t gonna aren&#39;t gonna sell out</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">so I wonder to what extent if you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">or the independent sort of pirate outlaw</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">in the Bronze Age pervert lingo</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">continues to gather strength you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:51.509" style="s2">power plays that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">history is all about right the big big</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.509" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">power plays and struggle for power I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">wonder how it plays out five to ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">years the interesting same well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">like I said there&#39;s a new player in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:05.509" style="s2">past you could be a really influential</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">person but if you didn&#39;t have a platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.509" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">nobody cared because you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">your message him or in the past you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:12.850" style="s2">might have a big platform but you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:15.070" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.850" end="00:02:15.910" style="s2">the skill of persuasion you didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.070" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">it was something you could actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.910" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">learn and get better at but now you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">both so so it&#39;s almost like a warlord</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:26.980" style="s2">situation where people are bringing you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.150" end="00:02:29.470" style="s2">know a million people with them on</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.980" end="00:02:32.200" style="s2">whatever ride they want to take them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.470" end="00:02:33.550" style="s2">if they&#39;re good at giving rides that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.200" end="00:02:37.240" style="s2">numbers gonna grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.550" end="00:02:39.670" style="s2">yeah fascinating yeah a warlord is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.240" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">very interesting language to use Bronze</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.670" end="00:02:44.320" style="s2">Age pervert uses like outlaws and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:46.630" style="s2">pirates and he uses imagery of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.320" end="00:02:49.030" style="s2">like marauding pirates you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.630" end="00:02:51.520" style="s2">traveling the globe taking over things</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.030" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s all image or it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.520" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">that literal right yeah I like mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:57.820" style="s2">better because the warlord assumes that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:02:59.770" style="s2">it&#39;s one person who&#39;s collected an army</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.820" end="00:03:01.690" style="s2">yeah that and that&#39;s what social media</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.130" end="00:03:19.930" style="s2">the rounds and and it basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.210" end="00:03:21.910" style="s2">described that we there&#39;s like sort of</p>

<p begin="00:03:21.910" end="00:03:28.120" style="s2">the knight and and that it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.190" end="00:03:30.670" style="s2">the Internet is a just a an arena for</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.120" end="00:03:32.800" style="s2">conflict and then the people who follow</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.670" end="00:03:34.420" style="s2">in the audience&#39;s you know they pick up</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.800" end="00:03:36.550" style="s2">the banner of the the person that they</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">around the internet supporting them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.260" end="00:03:41.800" style="s2">going on the ride as as you described it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:43.870" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting to me is you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.800" end="00:03:45.970" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have a million people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.870" end="00:03:48.340" style="s2">following you in order to have actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.970" end="00:03:50.440" style="s2">real world influence you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.340" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2">30,000 people which is nothing but more</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.440" end="00:03:53.530" style="s2">importantly we have a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.910" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">guys in the liminal order which is our</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.530" end="00:03:57.910" style="s2">sort of private community and it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:03:59.320" style="s2">where the real influence is happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.910" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">the real impacts happen because those</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.320" end="00:04:02.170" style="s2">guys are actually changing their lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:03.730" style="s2">and taking steps and measures that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.170" end="00:04:05.860" style="s2">impact themselves and their families and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.730" end="00:04:08.020" style="s2">their communities and that to me is sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.860" end="00:04:10.000" style="s2">of boom the way that you build sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.020" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">long-term response to whatever cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.000" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2">problems you may see out there but it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.910" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">going to be interesting to see what</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.970" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">happens you know an environment full of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.790" end="00:04:23.020" style="s2">warlords</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">is in a steady state right like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.020" end="00:04:27.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last forever or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.220" end="00:04:29.990" style="s2">or is it because like I said in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:32.210" style="s2">earlier examples you know capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.990" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">a bunch of robber barons and selfish</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.210" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">people they need jerks and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:39.170" style="s2">Crooks and Liars and yeah just the worst</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">people in the world but if your system</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.170" end="00:04:45.710" style="s2">is built right it produces gold so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know they&#39;re having all these</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.710" end="00:04:50.210" style="s2">these warlords with different you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:54.110" style="s2">idea sets I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.210" end="00:04:57.320" style="s2">because good ideas tend to win now if</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.110" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">I&#39;m calling myself a warlord in this in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.320" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">this context I don&#39;t mean it the bad way</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:05.180" style="s2">because you know I wake up every day I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:08.390" style="s2">already made my money and tried to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.180" end="00:05:10.550" style="s2">contribute something to to society and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.390" end="00:05:13.250" style="s2">work very hard and making sure that what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.550" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">I do has a you know a real world you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.250" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">know individual and collective benefit</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:22.340" style="s2">and as we talked earlier a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">ideas have bubbled up and become part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.340" end="00:05:27.860" style="s2">society you know the the idea of talent</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">stacks the idea of systems being better</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.860" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">than goals those have always existed in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:37.419" style="s2">some form but by by capturing them in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">really digestible approachable</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.419" end="00:05:42.680" style="s2">accessible form I was able to popularize</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:44.690" style="s2">them in a way that maybe somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.680" end="00:05:47.479" style="s2">didn&#39;t have persuasion and writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.690" end="00:05:49.970" style="s2">skills could not have so that those are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.479" end="00:05:51.710" style="s2">two examples of ideas that go you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.970" end="00:05:54.919" style="s2">they leave me and then they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.710" end="00:05:56.570" style="s2">fighting in the world of ideas and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.919" end="00:05:59.660" style="s2">they win it&#39;s because they deserved it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.570" end="00:06:02.780" style="s2">yeah well those two ideas in particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.660" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">really had an influence on me and it</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:10.340" style="s2">makes a the sort of innate desire i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.270" end="00:06:12.290" style="s2">to keep learning things seem more</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.340" end="00:06:15.169" style="s2">productive than it may have been before</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.290" end="00:06:18.710" style="s2">and it also makes learning things which</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.169" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">seem to be inconsequential or manual or</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.710" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">slightly technical or detail makes them</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">all seem much more important too because</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2">to the stack the more opportunities you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.390" end="00:06:31.729" style="s2">have like for example for me I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.700" end="00:06:33.560" style="s2">I&#39;m rising out of the din of people on</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.729" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">social media because I actually have a</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:39.629" style="s2">finance and public policy and I&#39;ve run</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.800" end="00:06:41.610" style="s2">companies and I&#39;ve developed real estate</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.629" end="00:06:42.659" style="s2">and I&#39;ve written books I&#39;ve done podcast</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.610" end="00:06:45.150" style="s2">you just start to add them all up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.659" end="00:06:47.069" style="s2">together and then you have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.150" end="00:06:48.509" style="s2">perspective that other people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.069" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2">like I can&#39;t tell you the number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.509" end="00:06:53.069" style="s2">times I&#39;ve had to engage when I worked</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:55.289" style="s2">in public policy I ran charter schools</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.069" end="00:06:57.539" style="s2">so I ran charter schools for 10 years as</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.289" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">executive director but I came to it from</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">entrepreneurial background I just cannot</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.719" end="00:07:04.409" style="s2">tell you the number of times that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:06.120" style="s2">would be sitting there talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.409" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">who are running multi-million dollar</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.120" end="00:07:10.979" style="s2">organizations that have absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.830" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">idea how to run multiple organizations</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.979" end="00:07:13.830" style="s2">because all they ever did was work in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">education all they ever did was work in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.830" end="00:07:16.500" style="s2">education they just moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">education and all of a sudden they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.500" end="00:07:20.939" style="s2">trying to run these businesses and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:22.169" style="s2">really can&#39;t but the talent stacks made</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.939" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">it something a little bit more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.169" end="00:07:25.710" style="s2">for me and it&#39;s also something that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:28.110" style="s2">know a lot of guys are really grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.710" end="00:07:29.969" style="s2">on to and just continuing to enhance and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.110" end="00:07:31.830" style="s2">and further its sort of the being an</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.969" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">autodidact and teaching yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.830" end="00:07:35.310" style="s2">expanding your capabilities and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.500" style="s2">eventually they all just line up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.310" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">cross up into something that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.500" end="00:07:42.539" style="s2">unique and and in this world and in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">information environment being unique is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.539" end="00:07:47.580" style="s2">is key and also key is getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:50.669" style="s2">discovered I was having this</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.580" end="00:07:53.639" style="s2">conversation the other day and people</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.669" end="00:07:55.409" style="s2">ask me all the time how can I get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.639" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">where you are or how can I write or how</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.409" end="00:08:01.099" style="s2">can I do this and and I tell them like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:05.460" style="s2">being discovered is the hardest part</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.099" end="00:08:06.750" style="s2">everybody has a platform now but you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.460" end="00:08:08.909" style="s2">even have great content but getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.750" end="00:08:11.099" style="s2">discovered is very difficult and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.909" end="00:08:13.650" style="s2">explained my idea was you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.099" end="00:08:15.479" style="s2">sort of high variance in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.650" end="00:08:16.889" style="s2">discovered what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.479" end="00:08:19.710" style="s2">what advice would you give to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.889" end="00:08:23.129" style="s2">who&#39;s got talent and a platform but</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.710" end="00:08:26.839" style="s2">nobody&#39;s listening well I&#39;m gonna gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.129" end="00:08:32.010" style="s2">give you an opposing viewpoint here yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.839" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">I once asked a table full of high-end</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.010" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">publishers and editors so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:38.010" style="s2">best in New York City the the high-end</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">publishing company and I asked this</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.010" end="00:08:42.659" style="s2">question of all the people there</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:44.370" style="s2">collectively they probably had several</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.659" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">hundreds of years of experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.370" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">publishing and I said do there exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:52.860" style="s2">great writers</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">who can&#39;t get published and every one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.860" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2">them said at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">no doesn&#39;t exist because and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">something that that I&#39;ve discovered you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:06.150" style="s2">know anecdotally through my own life</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.000" end="00:09:09.570" style="s2">that there is so much hunger for a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.150" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">content that if you produce it your odds</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.570" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">of finding a place for or you closer to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">100% than zero and I have an implication</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:22.140" style="s2">of your statement as pretty much well</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:23.820" style="s2">hold on yeah hold on now it doesn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.140" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it happens right away</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.820" end="00:09:28.440" style="s2">all right so certainly it takes a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">bit of luck just like everything else</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.440" end="00:09:33.900" style="s2">but I&#39;ll give you some concrete examples</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:37.290" style="s2">it was at a co-worker back when I worked</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.900" end="00:09:39.240" style="s2">in my cubicle forum at Pacific Valley we</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.290" end="00:09:40.860" style="s2">decided to write a book had never</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.240" end="00:09:43.110" style="s2">written the book you know didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.860" end="00:09:46.140" style="s2">any background that was suggests he</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.110" end="00:09:47.670" style="s2">could but he saw me write a book and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.140" end="00:09:50.610" style="s2">thought well if this guy could write a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.670" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">book how hard is it to write a book so</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.610" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">he just he sets the site on writing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:58.200" style="s2">book comes up with this great story you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:10:00.300" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t matter what it is gets</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.200" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">published and they asked him to write</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.300" end="00:10:05.100" style="s2">another book now of course they edited</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.180" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">all of his writing to you know fix it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.100" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">and everything but they they liked his</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:12.840" style="s2">idea and Stephen King has a book called</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:14.430" style="s2">on writing the Nao&#39;s recommend and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.840" end="00:10:16.560" style="s2">he recommends is that you start writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.430" end="00:10:18.510" style="s2">for anybody who will you know take it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:20.550" style="s2">and that gives you a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.510" end="00:10:22.620" style="s2">resume for the you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.550" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">person it doesn&#39;t pay much but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.620" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">hungry for content and then that gives</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:30.180" style="s2">you another resume to ratchet up very</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:34.260" style="s2">good advice but it but basically if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.180" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">can create content that people want the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.260" end="00:10:40.860" style="s2">the market is actually surprisingly easy</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">to get published at least now to your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.860" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">example is here but you&#39;re biting your</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.280" style="s2">tongue here because it would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">that you know you&#39;re thinking well why</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.280" end="00:10:51.150" style="s2">don&#39;t I have a million followers already</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:52.950" style="s2">because like I content is great people</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.150" end="00:10:57.690" style="s2">tell me or I wasn&#39;t thinking about me</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.950" end="00:11:00.780" style="s2">I&#39;m fine but but but you in fact are</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.690" end="00:11:02.780" style="s2">succeeding so you&#39;re so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.780" end="00:11:05.690" style="s2">the evidence suggests that your content</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.780" end="00:11:07.460" style="s2">is excellent because the evidence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.690" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">you got me on your show</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.460" end="00:11:12.050" style="s2">you got you got 30,000 people following</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:16.820" style="s2">you on Twitter and these things were</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.050" end="00:11:19.460" style="s2">likely to increase so I feel that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.820" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">and by the way cartooning let me tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.460" end="00:11:23.890" style="s2">you how hard it was to become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:26.900" style="s2">cartoonist I think at least at the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.890" end="00:11:29.630" style="s2">2,000 people or so would try to submit</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.900" end="00:11:32.900" style="s2">comics to become syndicated cartoonist</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:36.020" style="s2">meaning being in newspapers and Ana</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.900" end="00:11:38.420" style="s2">there was 2000 they might pick five and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.020" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">they would work with them for a year and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.420" end="00:11:43.010" style="s2">maybe only one or two of them they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:44.540" style="s2">decide to go go ahead with so you&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.010" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">to yourself well the odds of becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.540" end="00:11:49.940" style="s2">cartoonist they&#39;re just so bad it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:52.280" style="s2">you know one in 500 one in a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.940" end="00:11:54.440" style="s2">but then you talk to the editor who</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.280" end="00:11:56.930" style="s2">asked to pick cartoonists and you say</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.440" end="00:12:00.380" style="s2">how many of those two thousand are</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.930" end="00:12:02.660" style="s2">actually good and you find out well a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.380" end="00:12:06.290" style="s2">thousand of them come from the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.660" end="00:12:09.560" style="s2">and people in prison I&#39;m not even making</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.290" end="00:12:11.210" style="s2">that up maybe even right and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.560" end="00:12:12.980" style="s2">know there&#39;s another several hundred of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.210" end="00:12:16.790" style="s2">them that don&#39;t have any talent at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.980" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">and those can be rejected in moments so</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.790" end="00:12:21.530" style="s2">finding anybody who could actually do</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:25.250" style="s2">the work of being a cartoonist is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.530" end="00:12:26.900" style="s2">unusual that if you can do it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.250" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">probably going to be a cartoonist and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.900" end="00:12:32.180" style="s2">you&#39;re probably going to get paid for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:35.750" style="s2">so if you have talent people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.180" end="00:12:39.589" style="s2">find you if you don&#39;t have talent that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.470" style="s2">discoverability notion is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.670" end="00:12:54.200" style="s2">still in play but you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.470" end="00:12:56.030" style="s2">that talent will rise and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.200" end="00:12:57.940" style="s2">consistent and you take what I think you</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.000" end="00:13:59.200" style="s2">the the biggest difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.280" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">professional writer who&#39;s getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.200" end="00:14:04.300" style="s2">for their work and someone who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.890" style="s2">be a professional writer is that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.300" end="00:14:08.380" style="s2">professional writer who does get paid</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.890" end="00:14:10.300" style="s2">wrote stuff that&#39;s the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.380" end="00:14:11.920" style="s2">difference yeah I can&#39;t tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.300" end="00:14:13.660" style="s2">many people want to be an author but</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.920" end="00:14:15.670" style="s2">they don&#39;t write anything if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.660" end="00:14:17.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re not writing anything you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.670" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">not really moving in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.200" end="00:14:21.940" style="s2">right right yeah and so in a realistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:23.290" style="s2">world today I mean if you want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.940" end="00:14:25.030" style="s2">writer you could start you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.290" end="00:14:26.440" style="s2">obviously you start your own blog you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.030" end="00:14:28.270" style="s2">could then submit there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.440" end="00:14:29.950" style="s2">websites that are looking for content</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.270" end="00:14:31.690" style="s2">probably free at that point at that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.950" end="00:14:33.790" style="s2">point and you&#39;re right you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.690" end="00:14:35.860" style="s2">building it over time so but there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.790" end="00:14:38.260" style="s2">other element that&#39;s right time time is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.860" end="00:14:41.260" style="s2">that other element there how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.260" end="00:14:44.440" style="s2">would you suggest people you know find</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.260" end="00:14:46.660" style="s2">the strength or the the stamina to keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.440" end="00:14:48.220" style="s2">going until that moment that to turn</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.660" end="00:14:51.010" style="s2">that was those ten years into an</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.220" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">overnight success as it were well a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.010" end="00:14:55.570" style="s2">couple of things and I would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:57.310" style="s2">Stephen King here I think he recommends</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.570" end="00:14:59.290" style="s2">that you keep your day job while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.310" end="00:15:01.270" style="s2">while you&#39;re doing this other thing so</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.290" end="00:15:03.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be starving while</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:05.320" style="s2">you&#39;re getting your other thing off the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.310" end="00:15:08.020" style="s2">ground but one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.320" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">discovered that seems to be just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.020" end="00:15:13.390" style="s2">universal truth is they&#39;re things which</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:15.430" style="s2">will eventually work whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.390" end="00:15:18.130" style="s2">product or your writing or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.430" end="00:15:20.680" style="s2">things that will eventually work work</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.130" end="00:15:22.310" style="s2">right away and they work in a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.680" end="00:15:24.050" style="s2">form and I&#39;ll give you some example</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.310" end="00:15:26.630" style="s2">do you remember the first cellphones</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.050" end="00:15:28.840" style="s2">they&#39;re like this big brick and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.630" end="00:15:31.160" style="s2">dropped your calls and it was expensive</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.840" end="00:15:33.200" style="s2">basically everything that could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.160" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">with the product was wrong with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.200" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">first cell phones but people wanted them</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:41.060" style="s2">faster than they could be built so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:43.520" style="s2">told you that that was going to be huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.060" end="00:15:45.470" style="s2">the first computers were just a mess</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.520" end="00:15:47.870" style="s2">they were crashing they were slow they</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.470" end="00:15:49.640" style="s2">needed floppy disks but everybody wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.870" end="00:15:52.910" style="s2">them and you could tell that that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.640" end="00:15:55.490" style="s2">gonna stop so and in Dilbert - when</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.910" end="00:15:57.830" style="s2">Dilbert was first published even though</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.490" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">it was a failure for the first several</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.830" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">years because didn&#39;t grow an audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:05.510" style="s2">the audience that it did get were just</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:09.230" style="s2">over the over the moon so it had a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.510" end="00:16:11.690" style="s2">intense cult following which I said AHA</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.230" end="00:16:12.590" style="s2">you don&#39;t get that unless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.690" end="00:16:16.550" style="s2">something there</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.590" end="00:16:18.440" style="s2">so I still had to improve my talent to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.550" end="00:16:20.840" style="s2">take it to the next level I was very bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.440" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">when I first started because didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.840" end="00:16:24.440" style="s2">practice being a cartoonist but once I</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:27.220" style="s2">had done it for a while</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.440" end="00:16:29.420" style="s2">I just ratcheted up the quality and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.220" end="00:16:30.860" style="s2">eventually it caught on I mean it takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.420" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">a little luck and you have to hang</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.860" end="00:16:37.220" style="s2">around a while but people found me</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:39.380" style="s2">yeah I guess if the moment for me where</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.220" end="00:16:41.660" style="s2">I realized that I could actually do make</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.380" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">something of the writing is when people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.660" end="00:16:46.190" style="s2">that didn&#39;t know me who weren&#39;t my mom</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.760" end="00:16:48.080" style="s2">and weren&#39;t my girlfriend and weren&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.190" end="00:16:50.750" style="s2">friends were like oh I read this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.080" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">really good oh man somebody who had no</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.750" end="00:16:55.310" style="s2">invested interest in their opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t gonna impact me in any way or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.310" end="00:16:58.520" style="s2">at least that their opinion was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:00.170" style="s2">impact them came out with something</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.520" end="00:17:02.780" style="s2">positive and that you know for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.170" end="00:17:05.300" style="s2">that&#39;s in a wanting to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.780" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">creative career and to move forward that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.300" end="00:17:10.520" style="s2">those little pieces little pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">gold you really got to hang on to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.520" end="00:17:13.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like a little Fleck and they just</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:15.770" style="s2">hang on to it in your palm of your hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.610" end="00:17:18.050" style="s2">and you get one more like yeah one more</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.770" end="00:17:19.880" style="s2">Fleck and you add it up and before you</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.050" end="00:17:21.949" style="s2">know it things start taking off and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.880" end="00:17:23.870" style="s2">think that that&#39;s best sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.949" end="00:17:28.040" style="s2">where I am right now I&#39;ve finally</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.870" end="00:17:30.380" style="s2">accepted finally because you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.040" end="00:17:32.180" style="s2">issues like a lot of people where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.380" end="00:17:33.380" style="s2">just can&#39;t even believe good things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.180" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">are happening like it&#39;s so much easier</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.380" end="00:17:37.500" style="s2">to believe the bad things that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:38.910" style="s2">to you then the good things but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.500" end="00:17:40.350" style="s2">finally come to the point I think now</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.910" end="00:17:41.990" style="s2">where I feel confident that I can put</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.350" end="00:17:46.429" style="s2">out good content and people are into it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.990" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">but in your case you said that it you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.429" end="00:17:50.460" style="s2">Dilbert was a failure for the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:52.679" style="s2">couple of years now that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.460" end="00:17:55.230" style="s2">interesting statement because I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.679" end="00:17:57.390" style="s2">lot of people would say oh it was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.230" end="00:17:59.370" style="s2">syndicated cartoon that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.390" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">success you&#39;re getting paid right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.370" end="00:18:03.690" style="s2">getting paid probably every time it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:05.789" style="s2">published and so a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.690" end="00:18:10.230" style="s2">scream success but to you that said</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.789" end="00:18:12.390" style="s2">failure how was that failure so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.230" end="00:18:16.530" style="s2">know the exact number but something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.390" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">405 comics they get launched don&#39;t ever</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.600" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">slowly go away and get cancelled so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:25.409" style="s2">was in fewer than a hundred newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">and they weren&#39;t the big ones the big</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">a hit because it&#39;s sort of sort of about</p>
