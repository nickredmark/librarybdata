<p begin="00:00:03.419" end="00:00:07.290" style="s2">minutes where we were saying incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.490" end="00:00:09.540" style="s2">important things to you but you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">hearing them because of technical</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.540" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">difficulties so let&#39;s first say welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">to this first livestream of the Dark</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:23.160" style="s2">Horse podcast i&#39;m here with dr. heather</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">huiying i am brett weinstein let me do</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.160" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">what I did last time and say we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:29.369" style="s2">we&#39;re both PhDs in biology but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:30.510" style="s2">medical doctors so we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.369" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">talking about the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.510" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">implications of what we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">both biological and social but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">providing medical advice okay we I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">say there might be some medically</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">relevant things but if we offer to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">surgery on you you should politely</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">decline definitely not surgeons despite</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">having some life skills right oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">considerable knife skills all right so</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:01:09.659" style="s2">here we obviously collectively are</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">facing some sort of crisis there&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.659" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">somebody you know can you reload the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:21.560" style="s2">page and see whether or not it fixes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:21.560" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.170" end="00:01:39.020" style="s2">apologies folks this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.460" end="00:01:40.940" style="s2">first time from the studio we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.020" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">recently moved the studio to our house</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.940" end="00:01:45.440" style="s2">expecting for a number of reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:47.510" style="s2">expecting to be stuck in place</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.440" end="00:01:50.620" style="s2">sheltering in place for a while here in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.510" end="00:01:52.730" style="s2">Portland Oregon so this Brett just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.620" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">finished putting up the cedar that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.730" end="00:01:57.140" style="s2">see in the background last night around</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:59.660" style="s2">midnight I think installed the cabinets</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.140" end="00:02:04.940" style="s2">and the butcher block behind us sometime</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.660" end="00:02:06.710" style="s2">yesterday the day before that&#39;s going so</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.940" end="00:02:08.600" style="s2">fast I can&#39;t really read it some people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.710" end="00:02:12.410" style="s2">seem to think it&#39;s working fine now this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.600" end="00:02:14.600" style="s2">is fine let&#39;s try yes no looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.410" end="00:02:20.240" style="s2">an awful lot of people if you are having</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.600" end="00:02:21.950" style="s2">trouble with the lag so we will this</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.240" end="00:02:23.750" style="s2">will be up this will be up be on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.950" end="00:02:27.170" style="s2">live stream and we&#39;ll be out as a Dark</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.750" end="00:02:29.600" style="s2">Horse podcast as well okay let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.170" end="00:02:32.989" style="s2">hope that this is working and I need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.600" end="00:02:36.350" style="s2">project as always apparently and get</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.989" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">down to some content okay so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.350" end="00:02:41.050" style="s2">try to ignore all the comments about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:45.910" style="s2">lag hopefully you can ignore the lag</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.050" end="00:02:48.860" style="s2">what our plan to do here is to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.910" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">elements of this crisis and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.860" end="00:02:54.110" style="s2">that there are two crises unfolding and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">an interesting interaction between them</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.110" end="00:03:00.519" style="s2">we have obviously a crisis related to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:03.730" style="s2">kovat 19 and its spread and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.519" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">measures designed to flatten the curve</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.730" end="00:03:10.250" style="s2">then we also have a crisis unfolding as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:13.100" style="s2">people are recognizing that the society</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.250" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">that we live in is structured in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.100" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">potentially fragile way and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:21.980" style="s2">is that these two crises interact rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">directly not only is the virus causing</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.980" end="00:03:26.870" style="s2">the fragility to show in the system but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:30.230" style="s2">it robs us of many of the measures that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.870" end="00:03:32.120" style="s2">we would ordinarily potentially use to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.230" end="00:03:33.590" style="s2">let&#39;s say rescue ourselves from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.120" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">depression there are many kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.590" end="00:03:39.709" style="s2">stimulus it just simply won&#39;t work if</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:40.840" style="s2">you have people being told to stay away</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.709" end="00:03:44.050" style="s2">from each other mister lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.840" end="00:03:46.090" style="s2">things just simply can&#39;t do that I saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.050" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">some of you were asking in the responses</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.090" end="00:03:50.140" style="s2">to our tweets about this for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">discussion of game B in light of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.140" end="00:03:54.910" style="s2">going on which Bret has talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:57.849" style="s2">other context and to the fourth frontier</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.910" end="00:03:59.769" style="s2">which is a concept that Brett innovated</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.849" end="00:04:03.489" style="s2">and we&#39;ve both been writing about in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.769" end="00:04:05.769" style="s2">book that we are writing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.489" end="00:04:07.660" style="s2">this is probably not the hour or so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.769" end="00:04:10.390" style="s2">we&#39;ll be talking about that but we hope</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.660" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">to be back every every few days and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.390" end="00:04:14.170" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to talking about that at some</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:19.479" style="s2">point soon just just to clarify fourth</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.170" end="00:04:22.090" style="s2">frontier is my attempt to bootstrap a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.479" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">kind of game B project game B was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.090" end="00:04:26.110" style="s2">collaborative effort amongst a number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">people including Jordan Green Hall and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:31.930" style="s2">Jim rut so anyway we can we can return</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:34.539" style="s2">to that topic later at the moment what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.930" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">this crisis is doing is it is revealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.539" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">some of the things that those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:41.169" style="s2">gathered for game B were concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">the things that brought us together was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.169" end="00:04:47.470" style="s2">a recognition that our system simply was</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">both inviting crises and unable to deal</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.470" end="00:04:51.850" style="s2">with them which we are now seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:53.650" style="s2">living color and you know the problem at</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.850" end="00:04:57.099" style="s2">the moment that this particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.650" end="00:05:00.190" style="s2">March 24th is that increasing in urgency</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.099" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">and volume is the idea that you can save</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.190" end="00:05:06.550" style="s2">grandma or you can save the Dow and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">is a really an abhorrent way of framing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:14.050" style="s2">the issue and we somehow have to both</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">combat the virus and not tank worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.050" end="00:05:19.450" style="s2">economy on the way but but preserving</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:22.810" style="s2">the fragile systems that have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.450" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">created in explicitly anti fragile ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.810" end="00:05:29.380" style="s2">is not necessarily the route to do and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:35.560" style="s2">so the other thing to realize is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.380" end="00:05:39.460" style="s2">this crisis or this pair of crises is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.560" end="00:05:41.050" style="s2">is revealing a core element that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.460" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">been missing from our political dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.050" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">which is effectively that our system</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:50.890" style="s2">cannot help but optimize for economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:53.069" style="s2">efficiency on short timescales it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.890" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">simply what it is built to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.069" end="00:05:59.129" style="s2">and essentially you&#39;ve got a two-sided</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:01.469" style="s2">coin economic efficiency on short tides</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.129" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">timescales is on one side of that coin</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.469" end="00:06:05.729" style="s2">and fragility is the other side you will</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:08.550" style="s2">produce fragility to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.729" end="00:06:09.869" style="s2">optimize economic efficiency on short</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:13.349" style="s2">timescales and so that&#39;s where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.869" end="00:06:16.529" style="s2">landed and if there is a silver lining</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.349" end="00:06:19.770" style="s2">here it is that if we come through this</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.529" end="00:06:21.899" style="s2">crisis okay maybe we can learn the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.770" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">lesson that it has to teach us about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.899" end="00:06:25.770" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been doing wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:29.399" style="s2">restructure so this can&#39;t happen again</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.770" end="00:06:30.599" style="s2">it actually reminds me of something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.399" end="00:06:34.830" style="s2">one of our graduate school professors</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.599" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">once said to us he was he was watching</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.830" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">squirrels berry nuts and sort of laughed</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:43.860" style="s2">at them and suggested that squirrels are</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:46.020" style="s2">dumb they&#39;re stupid because they berry</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.860" end="00:06:48.419" style="s2">so many more nuts than they ever dig up</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.020" end="00:06:54.599" style="s2">in a normal year it was the acorns</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.419" end="00:06:57.259" style="s2">actually and of course this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.599" end="00:07:00.089" style="s2">wrong and it is exactly the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.259" end="00:07:04.159" style="s2">short-sighted thinking that is causing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.089" end="00:07:07.319" style="s2">us to panic right now that squirrels</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.159" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">berry acorns for the worst year that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.319" end="00:07:12.509" style="s2">they might encounter and those that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:14.370" style="s2">don&#39;t will benefit short-term and will</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.509" end="00:07:18.269" style="s2">then probably parasitize those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.370" end="00:07:20.519" style="s2">berry enough for the ten year winter the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.269" end="00:07:21.959" style="s2">hundred year winter the thousand year</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.519" end="00:07:25.219" style="s2">pandemic whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.959" end="00:07:29.209" style="s2">so did we in fact either individually or</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.219" end="00:07:32.399" style="s2">by city or by nation state or globally</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.399" end="00:07:36.089" style="s2">certainly hope so and maybe we can learn</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.409" end="00:07:38.399" style="s2">enough from what&#39;s going on right now to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.089" end="00:07:42.990" style="s2">both survive the pandemic and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.399" end="00:07:45.990" style="s2">economic fallout all right so we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.990" end="00:07:47.639" style="s2">well so we were I apologize I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.990" end="00:07:49.289" style="s2">remember what we said before when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.639" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">thought we were streaming and and since</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.289" end="00:07:53.189" style="s2">we&#39;ve been streaming we had wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:56.099" style="s2">talk about some of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.189" end="00:07:57.569" style="s2">biology and how to interpret some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.099" end="00:07:59.729" style="s2">advice that&#39;s coming out in real time</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.569" end="00:08:00.990" style="s2">from the media and the government with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.729" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">an evolutionary lens so you can make</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.990" end="00:08:05.940" style="s2">decisions for yourself and also some of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:08.280" style="s2">the societal impacts both of which are</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.940" end="00:08:11.220" style="s2">evolutionary so maybe we want to start</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.280" end="00:08:13.410" style="s2">with some of the biology let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.220" end="00:08:15.870" style="s2">with some of the biology let me just</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.410" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">pause here hey Zach if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.870" end="00:08:28.140" style="s2">switch to the other audio source on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:31.110" style="s2">camera would they sync okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.140" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">so zach is our 15 year old son who was</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.110" end="00:08:37.260" style="s2">also our tech support okay so we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">going to talk about the biology and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.260" end="00:08:42.120" style="s2">have a number of things that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:44.690" style="s2">on the list of biological factors maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.120" end="00:08:48.060" style="s2">I would say something overarching first</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.690" end="00:08:51.300" style="s2">the virus is not trying to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.060" end="00:08:55.980" style="s2">that&#39;s going to sound odd it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.300" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">seems like viruses are built to do such</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.980" end="00:09:01.170" style="s2">things and that that that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:02.610" style="s2">such a big problem but it is important</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:05.190" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to think about things</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.610" end="00:09:08.070" style="s2">like viruses to realize that they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.190" end="00:09:09.900" style="s2">optimized to do exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.070" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">that the rest of us are evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.900" end="00:09:15.450" style="s2">speaking and while in school you may</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">have learned that Fitness is the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.450" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">thing as reproduction this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:21.540" style="s2">correct way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:23.520" style="s2">creatures all of them are trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.540" end="00:09:25.710" style="s2">into the future and they are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.520" end="00:09:27.780" style="s2">get as deeply into the future as they</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.710" end="00:09:30.090" style="s2">can this is true even though a virus</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.780" end="00:09:34.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t technically a creature I actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.090" end="00:09:36.840" style="s2">would differ a little bit on this point</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.530" end="00:09:41.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get stuck here but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.840" end="00:09:45.450" style="s2">think when somebody says you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.540" end="00:09:48.990" style="s2">drove to the market the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.450" end="00:09:50.430" style="s2">had to use a car to do it does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:54.089" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t actually drive to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.430" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">market and so anyway viruses are a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.089" end="00:09:58.530" style="s2">interesting evolutionary phenomenon they</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:10:01.190" style="s2">may indeed be genes that have escaped</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.530" end="00:10:04.380" style="s2">from the kinds of creatures that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.190" end="00:10:07.350" style="s2">parasitize and then they periodically I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:10.290" style="s2">mean a virus is just a an informational</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.350" end="00:10:12.630" style="s2">molecule either DNA or RNA wrapped in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.290" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">coat that does some work to get it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.630" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">into a cell but basically that code</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:20.860" style="s2">either integrates into the genome or</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">reverse transcribes and then integrates</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.860" end="00:10:24.430" style="s2">into the genome and it instructs the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:25.750" style="s2">genome the distinction being if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.430" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">reversed transcribes it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.750" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">retrovirus and if it and if it codes</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:31.899" style="s2">under the genome directly I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.790" style="s2">I&#39;m using the right language it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">called a virus among which there are</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.790" end="00:10:39.329" style="s2">many kinds of viruses including for</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">instance corona viruses so these codes</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.329" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">find their way into the genome and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:46.180" style="s2">they hijack the cell for their own</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:49.959" style="s2">purposes and their own purposes are they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.180" end="00:10:54.430" style="s2">create more virus in a form that it can</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.959" end="00:10:56.920" style="s2">infect more creatures and this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.430" end="00:10:58.089" style="s2">process frees them from a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.920" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">constraints of something like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.089" end="00:11:02.589" style="s2">bacterium would have if it was on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.899" style="s2">mission because basically they&#39;ve shed</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.589" end="00:11:07.319" style="s2">all of the machinery necessary for life</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.899" end="00:11:09.990" style="s2">and then they borrow it wherever they go</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.319" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">but if I can return to this point about</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.990" end="00:11:14.829" style="s2">the virus is not trying to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:16.779" style="s2">viruses like other creatures or parts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.829" end="00:11:19.870" style="s2">creatures are trying to get as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.779" end="00:11:21.699" style="s2">into the future as they can get what</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.870" end="00:11:23.230" style="s2">what creatures do we see we see the ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.699" end="00:11:26.649" style="s2">that have gotten this far into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.230" end="00:11:29.620" style="s2">future so getting into the future is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.649" end="00:11:31.389" style="s2">complex puzzle reproduction is one part</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.620" end="00:11:33.339" style="s2">of that puzzle but it is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.389" end="00:11:36.009" style="s2">part you can reproduce a lot and fail to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.339" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">get into the future so we we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.009" end="00:11:40.930" style="s2">understand that best by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:43.029" style="s2">global collapse such that even though an</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.930" end="00:11:44.620" style="s2">individual&#39;s still survived there was no</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.029" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">chance of them persisting into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.620" end="00:11:48.339" style="s2">future beyond 20 years or so with all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:49.629" style="s2">the supply chains and systems that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.339" end="00:11:52.120" style="s2">dependent upon gone</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.629" end="00:11:53.829" style="s2">we are not parasites by the usual</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.120" end="00:11:58.629" style="s2">definition of the word but viruses</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.829" end="00:12:00.339" style="s2">require a host I think I it must be that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.629" end="00:12:04.089" style="s2">all known viruses although neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.339" end="00:12:06.939" style="s2">are biologists require a host to to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.089" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">active and so a virus that kills its</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.939" end="00:12:11.800" style="s2">host and has no way of transmitting to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.720" style="s2">new host is a failure as a virus and no</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.800" end="00:12:15.339" style="s2">virus just like know anything wants to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.720" end="00:12:17.470" style="s2">be a failure in this regard and you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.339" end="00:12:19.029" style="s2">we&#39;re using watts and such in this sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.470" end="00:12:20.470" style="s2">of evolutionary shorthand there&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.029" end="00:12:22.809" style="s2">course no consciousness ascribed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.470" end="00:12:25.149" style="s2">viruses but a virus that kills its host</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.809" end="00:12:28.360" style="s2">and is then stuck in that host to die as</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.149" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">well has has not succeeded in its viral</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.360" end="00:12:32.140" style="s2">mission it behaves as if it wants is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:33.670" style="s2">basically when we say</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.140" end="00:12:37.510" style="s2">that a creature wants that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.670" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">mean it behaves as if it wants so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.510" end="00:12:42.450" style="s2">other thing to say though is the virus</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even want to make you sick</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.450" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">ideally a virus would make you minimally</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:51.130" style="s2">sick so that you did an effective job of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">spreading it to the extent that you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.130" end="00:12:56.890" style="s2">you know comatose somewhere you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:58.690" style="s2">interacting with other people so there</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.890" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">are parasites that actually do want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.690" end="00:13:03.850" style="s2">knock you flat so malaria for example or</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:05.890" style="s2">yellow fever are transmitted by a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.850" end="00:13:07.990" style="s2">mosquito that has much more access to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.890" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">you if you&#39;re unable to swat them away</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.990" end="00:13:12.700" style="s2">but a virus I would say that even with</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.950" style="s2">the malaria and you know no one came</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.700" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">here to hear about malaria I&#39;m sure but</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.950" end="00:13:17.290" style="s2">there are four different species of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:21.670" style="s2">malaria right there&#39;s four different</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.290" end="00:13:22.570" style="s2">Plasmodium species more than that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.670" end="00:13:24.459" style="s2">there are four different malarial</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.570" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">Plasmodium species two of which are very</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.459" end="00:13:28.360" style="s2">common one of which tends to leave you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.560" style="s2">walking around and hides in your liver</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.360" end="00:13:32.260" style="s2">and comes back out and then your</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.560" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">infectious again it&#39;s vivax and then one</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.260" end="00:13:36.010" style="s2">felt suprem tends to go to your brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:39.130" style="s2">and kill you and that&#39;s called cerebral</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.010" end="00:13:41.529" style="s2">malaria so even within you know a genus</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.130" end="00:13:44.410" style="s2">of a totally different parasite of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.529" end="00:13:46.360" style="s2">Plasmodium that is that cause of malaria</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.410" end="00:13:49.720" style="s2">there are wildly different strategies</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.360" end="00:13:51.399" style="s2">but even even the the vivax the one that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.720" end="00:13:53.079" style="s2">leaves you walking around at the point</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.399" end="00:13:55.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s most transmissible you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.079" end="00:13:58.600" style="s2">walking around so it it comes in waves</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.480" end="00:14:00.279" style="s2">so it recurs and it&#39;ll knock you flat</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.600" end="00:14:02.649" style="s2">leaves you vulnerable to mosquitos and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.279" end="00:14:06.279" style="s2">be transmitted but something like corona</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.649" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">virus or the flu have an interest in you</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">them around now this is why I raise this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.829" end="00:14:19.060" style="s2">point not only is this virus not</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.060" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">interested in making you sick it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.060" end="00:14:24.100" style="s2">help but make you sick but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:27.300" style="s2">tendency over time for viruses to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.100" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">in the direction of being less</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.300" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">troublesome as indeed we&#39;ve seen with</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">many of the other known corona viruses</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">which cause the common cold</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:38.649" style="s2">they tend to be irritations in daily</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:42.550" style="s2">life rather than causing what</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.649" end="00:14:45.300" style="s2">Sarris co2 is causing now in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.550" end="00:14:48.930" style="s2">this virus it has just met</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.300" end="00:14:50.460" style="s2">humans presumably for the first time now</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.930" end="00:14:52.910" style="s2">I believe that there is still debate</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.460" end="00:14:56.370" style="s2">about what creature this emerged from</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.910" end="00:15:00.030" style="s2">Pangolin is a possibility baddest funny</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.370" end="00:15:01.770" style="s2">is a stronger possibility and really by</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.030" end="00:15:04.170" style="s2">whatever mechanism even if somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.770" end="00:15:05.910" style="s2">playing with this virus in a lab and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.170" end="00:15:08.670" style="s2">escaped but they had ultimately gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.910" end="00:15:11.940" style="s2">it from bats this has implications and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.670" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know so by this again by this has</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.940" end="00:15:17.160" style="s2">implications what you mean is there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:19.260" style="s2">no history shared between humans and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.160" end="00:15:20.790" style="s2">this virus that is that is that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.260" end="00:15:21.690" style="s2">this you&#39;re talking well I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.790" end="00:15:24.990" style="s2">something more than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.690" end="00:15:27.870" style="s2">I very much want to know what creature</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.990" end="00:15:30.030" style="s2">this came from even bat isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.870" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">enough bats are not interchangeable now</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.030" end="00:15:35.610" style="s2">probably if this came from a bat it came</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:38.400" style="s2">from a rhino low fat bat which would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.610" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">a gleaming insectivore an old-world</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.400" end="00:15:44.700" style="s2">gleaning insectivore and probably cave</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:47.580" style="s2">roosting now the reason that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.700" end="00:15:51.480" style="s2">matters is if you think about it the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.580" end="00:15:55.110" style="s2">virus has to get spread in the creature</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.480" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">that it is native to now if you&#39;re a bat</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.110" end="00:15:59.610" style="s2">and you&#39;re a gleaning insectivore you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:01.110" style="s2">not encountering a lot of other gleaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.610" end="00:16:03.870" style="s2">insectivores cleaning means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.110" end="00:16:05.340" style="s2">picking large insects off of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.870" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">things as opposed to hulking where</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.340" end="00:16:11.070" style="s2">you&#39;re catching stuff in midair if</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:13.530" style="s2">you&#39;re a gleaning insectivore then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.070" end="00:16:15.540" style="s2">are not running into other bats you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.530" end="00:16:17.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have close contact with them while</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.540" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">you&#39;re out for it they don&#39;t call any</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.130" end="00:16:22.410" style="s2">wrist no you do have close contact with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:26.340" style="s2">them when you&#39;re asleep during the day</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.410" end="00:16:29.880" style="s2">and so the question is if this virus</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.340" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">came from a bat and was transported into</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:35.400" style="s2">humans by some mechanism either a wet</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:38.250" style="s2">market or a laboratory then does that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.400" end="00:16:40.590" style="s2">predict anything about the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.250" end="00:16:43.950" style="s2">it is transmitted between humans in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.590" end="00:16:47.070" style="s2">other words does it regard night as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.950" end="00:16:49.800" style="s2">time to be transmitted because bats are</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.070" end="00:16:51.210" style="s2">active during the night and we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.800" end="00:16:54.360" style="s2">active during the day and it registers</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.210" end="00:16:55.780" style="s2">activity does it have some other well it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">would be the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.780" end="00:17:01.150" style="s2">if your story about the bats is true if</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:03.370" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s simply based on photo</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.150" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">period no no this is my point it could</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.370" end="00:17:07.300" style="s2">be that it&#39;s registering information</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:09.819" style="s2">about what time of day it is it could</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.300" end="00:17:11.680" style="s2">also be the bats have a signal this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.819" end="00:17:13.540" style="s2">the active nozzle because we have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.680" end="00:17:16.990" style="s2">opposite circadian rhythm is that right</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.540" end="00:17:19.810" style="s2">exactly and so we know that this virus</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.990" end="00:17:22.209" style="s2">is highly transmissible inside the home</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.810" end="00:17:24.490" style="s2">part of the reason may be that our</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.209" end="00:17:27.850" style="s2">dormancy takes place inside the home and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.490" end="00:17:30.460" style="s2">that the signal is causing it to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.850" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">at those periods of time it may also be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.460" end="00:17:36.250" style="s2">transmissible by for example you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:37.690" style="s2">wonder about waterborne transmission I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.250" end="00:17:40.090" style="s2">know it&#39;s possible for it to live in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.690" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">water but the caves in which these bats</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.090" end="00:17:43.420" style="s2">would be likely to roost often have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.850" style="s2">water flowing through them that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.420" end="00:17:47.290" style="s2">tends to form these caves and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.850" end="00:17:49.060" style="s2">just as long as there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.290" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">good segues there but let&#39;s at least go</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.060" end="00:17:53.050" style="s2">to how do how do we currently understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:54.580" style="s2">this particular virus to be transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.050" end="00:17:57.310" style="s2">with the understanding that everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.580" end="00:17:59.290" style="s2">that we know about this virus is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.310" end="00:18:01.300" style="s2">new and some of it is likely to end up</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.290" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">being wrong but what we think we know</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.300" end="00:18:08.290" style="s2">now is yes as we all know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:10.540" style="s2">aerosolized coughs I can hang in the air</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.290" end="00:18:13.720" style="s2">for a couple of hours which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.540" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">alarming clearly it goes through fecal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.720" end="00:18:19.720" style="s2">contact so wash your hands and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:21.730" style="s2">lick buts basically oh and perhaps blood</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.720" end="00:18:23.290" style="s2">too okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s a possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.730" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">amount of transmission as well and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.290" end="00:18:28.390" style="s2">side of this there&#39;s so many new</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:30.310" style="s2">articles here we can maybe post it in</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.390" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">the notes afterwards or if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.310" end="00:18:34.840" style="s2">put it up Zak you can but it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:37.000" style="s2">at all 20/20 but we don&#39;t need it it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.840" end="00:18:39.850" style="s2">remain on surfaces for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.000" end="00:18:42.550" style="s2">copper is historically understood to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.850" end="00:18:44.500" style="s2">this remarkable antimicrobial so it only</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.550" end="00:18:47.290" style="s2">sticks around on copper for four hours</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.500" end="00:18:49.930" style="s2">of up to 24 hours on cardboard up to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.290" end="00:18:52.750" style="s2">nine days maybe on hard surfaces like</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.930" end="00:18:55.630" style="s2">stainless steel and plastic so what does</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.750" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">that mean if we know those things about</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.630" end="00:19:00.340" style="s2">transmission you know how should you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:04.750" style="s2">behave when you get a package at your</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.340" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">door or or you know what would you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.750" end="00:19:10.250" style="s2">with your doorknob and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:13.310" style="s2">such well one thing that&#39;s true is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.250" end="00:19:16.190" style="s2">saying that a virus could remain active</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.310" end="00:19:18.650" style="s2">and therefore transmittable on stainless</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.190" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">door knob for nine days does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.650" end="00:19:22.760" style="s2">that if there was virus on that doorknob</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">at the point that someone coughed on it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.760" end="00:19:26.060" style="s2">or touched it with active viral load on</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.380" end="00:19:27.830" style="s2">their hands that there is just as much</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.060" end="00:19:29.510" style="s2">risk at that moment as there is nine</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.830" end="00:19:31.880" style="s2">days out there&#39;s going to be a decay</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.510" end="00:19:37.160" style="s2">function associated with it and so yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.880" end="00:19:40.130" style="s2">you could you could possibly get this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.160" end="00:19:42.490" style="s2">virus from touching some kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.130" end="00:19:45.410" style="s2">surfaces over a week after they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.490" end="00:19:48.460" style="s2">contaminated but it&#39;s still less likely</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.410" end="00:19:52.010" style="s2">the farther out it is yes at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.460" end="00:19:55.580" style="s2">so again I want to focus in on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.010" end="00:19:59.680" style="s2">point this virus just met us it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.580" end="00:20:03.110" style="s2">a bang-up job of spreading we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.680" end="00:20:05.780" style="s2">deploying countermeasures the job of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.110" end="00:20:07.550" style="s2">virus from its perspective is to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.780" end="00:20:09.830" style="s2">into the future to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.550" end="00:20:11.900" style="s2">deploy a countermeasure that frustrates</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.830" end="00:20:15.290" style="s2">it in its quest to get into the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.900" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">it is in search of some alternate</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.290" end="00:20:23.510" style="s2">modality and so almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:26.270" style="s2">variation in these this particular virus</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.510" end="00:20:28.510" style="s2">will be lost almost all of it is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.270" end="00:20:31.250" style="s2">to be in strains that are dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.510" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">occasionally one will discover something</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.250" end="00:20:40.340" style="s2">and at the moment I think it is fair to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:43.310" style="s2">say that kovat 19 uses airplanes the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.340" end="00:20:45.050" style="s2">malaria music uses mosquitoes right two</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.310" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">airplanes are transmitting the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.050" end="00:20:48.830" style="s2">between populations and we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:52.700" style="s2">be highly effective and now we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.830" end="00:20:56.840" style="s2">travel has been shut down a very wise</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.700" end="00:20:59.750" style="s2">move but what will it do next and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.840" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">importantly is there something about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.750" end="00:21:03.890" style="s2">way we deploy countermeasures that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.140" style="s2">successfully Corral the virus</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.140" end="00:21:09.470" style="s2">thinking about this class so the we here</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.910" end="00:21:11.390" style="s2">means both at the individual level at</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.390" end="00:21:15.929" style="s2">and correct I misspoke earlier I said</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.009" end="00:21:17.309" style="s2">that it can be aerosolized and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.929" end="00:21:19.649" style="s2">actually no evidence that it aerosol</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.309" end="00:21:22.679" style="s2">eise&#39;s but it is air in airborne</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.649" end="00:21:25.230" style="s2">droplets that can apparently hang in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.679" end="00:21:27.029" style="s2">air before up to a few hours so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.230" end="00:21:29.249" style="s2">distinction being it will not blow off a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.029" end="00:21:30.929" style="s2">dry surface into the air but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.249" end="00:21:33.450" style="s2">certainly in the air right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.929" end="00:21:36.450" style="s2">certainly in the air and actually highly</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.450" end="00:21:40.409" style="s2">likely mode of transmission are droplets</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.450" end="00:21:42.029" style="s2">yeah so point isn&#39;t I mean there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.409" end="00:21:43.769" style="s2">many things to get to but maybe some you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.029" end="00:21:46.409" style="s2">know this this gets one place this gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.769" end="00:21:50.190" style="s2">us to is some of the rumors and innuendo</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.409" end="00:21:52.559" style="s2">that have spread one of which is since</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.190" end="00:21:54.629" style="s2">let&#39;s see in February 5th the New York</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.559" end="00:21:55.080" style="s2">Times said don&#39;t wear masks it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.629" end="00:21:57.649" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.080" end="00:22:01.409" style="s2">On February 29th the US Surgeon General</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.649" end="00:22:05.639" style="s2">said don&#39;t wear masks and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.409" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">patently insane right now so this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.639" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">Thank You Zack this is the New York</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:13.109" style="s2">Times for Bri v and then the you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.220" end="00:22:17.210" style="s2">three weeks later and of course time</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.109" end="00:22:19.529" style="s2">means everything in this in this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.210" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">the Surgeon General the US Surgeon</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.529" end="00:22:26.580" style="s2">General says don&#39;t wear masks clearly in</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:28.049" style="s2">part what they were doing if if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.580" end="00:22:29.700" style="s2">knew what they were doing at all was</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.049" end="00:22:32.970" style="s2">prioritizing Public Health over</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.700" end="00:22:35.940" style="s2">individuals and thus understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.970" end="00:22:38.460" style="s2">we had a perhaps global but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.940" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">national lack of supply of personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.460" end="00:22:45.739" style="s2">protective gear they were trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:48.570" style="s2">people from stockpiling masks but it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.739" end="00:22:50.429" style="s2">it&#39;s gross negligence frankly to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.570" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">advised people for this long that masks</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.429" end="00:22:54.330" style="s2">would do no good so you know Bret</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">tweeted out a couple days ago and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.330" end="00:22:59.159" style="s2">no now wearing and is tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:23:01.799" style="s2">wearing a bandanna you know can is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.159" end="00:23:05.129" style="s2">possible that&#39;s actually not effective</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.799" end="00:23:08.509" style="s2">in any way from blocking the inhalation</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.129" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">of droplets into the nose or mouth of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.509" end="00:23:13.859" style="s2">course it&#39;s going to be effective will</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:17.340" style="s2">it be as effective as an n95 or an 99 or</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.859" end="00:23:19.169" style="s2">a 99 mask probably not well it depends</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.340" end="00:23:21.450" style="s2">it could be more effective for you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.169" end="00:23:23.249" style="s2">taken a couple census because so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.450" end="00:23:26.870" style="s2">actually I&#39;d like to go through this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.249" end="00:23:31.340" style="s2">detail but the band</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.870" end="00:23:33.140" style="s2">Anna functions right I&#39;ll tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.340" end="00:23:35.630" style="s2">little bit about my sort of method of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.140" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">using it but the fact is I actually do</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.630" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">wear it and I wear it when I go out and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:45.890" style="s2">a medical mask I might considered</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:47.420" style="s2">wearing that too if I even had them but</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.890" end="00:23:51.559" style="s2">the fact is this is just something that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.420" end="00:23:53.240" style="s2">I can deploy and I know I know how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.559" end="00:23:55.280" style="s2">wear it you know in a way that it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.240" end="00:23:56.900" style="s2">of course catch droplets I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.280" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve compared them head to head in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.900" end="00:24:00.500" style="s2">controlled test whether it would be as</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:03.050" style="s2">effective as a mask maybe not but my</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.500" end="00:24:04.700" style="s2">guess would be as in all complex</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.050" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">phenomena there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.700" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">diminishing returns here and this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:09.920" style="s2">going to be highly effective even if not</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">quite as effective and certainly if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.920" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have masks as most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:17.450" style="s2">its countermeasure worth deploying</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:20.840" style="s2">absolutely anything else to say about</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.450" end="00:24:24.350" style="s2">masks well let me let me give a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.840" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">how I&#39;ve been managing this I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.350" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">doing a lot of stuff out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:31.429" style="s2">Heather and I moved to Portland recently</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">we were pretty well prepared when we</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.429" end="00:24:37.100" style="s2">lived in Olympia for you know some</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:38.840" style="s2">systems the breakdown of systems but</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.100" end="00:24:41.990" style="s2">when we moved we lost a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.840" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">that we had been accumulating and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.990" end="00:24:48.380" style="s2">anyway as this crisis has unfolded it</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:51.140" style="s2">has been necessary for us to bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.380" end="00:24:53.870" style="s2">some sort of mechanism for continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.140" end="00:24:56.840" style="s2">to be here you know in light of various</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.870" end="00:24:58.670" style="s2">different crises if the light stays on</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.840" end="00:25:00.410" style="s2">and the water stays on the gas stays on</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.670" end="00:25:02.630" style="s2">it&#39;s one level of crisis if those things</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.410" end="00:25:04.040" style="s2">were to fail it&#39;s very different but in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.630" end="00:25:08.500" style="s2">any case I&#39;ve had a lot of reason that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.040" end="00:25:13.130" style="s2">felt I had to go out into the world also</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.500" end="00:25:15.260" style="s2">Zac our son and I had to rescue all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.130" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">materials for the Dark Horse podcast to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.260" end="00:25:22.100" style="s2">bring them back here so we spent four</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:24.110" style="s2">late nights dismantling the studio and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.100" end="00:25:26.120" style="s2">bringing all the the elements here and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.110" end="00:25:29.179" style="s2">that required going into a space where</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.120" end="00:25:30.530" style="s2">people were working and so well but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.179" end="00:25:32.270" style="s2">mean you to be fair you were there</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.530" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">between about 10:00 and 2:00 in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.270" end="00:25:34.280" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:35.870" style="s2">each of four consecutive nights do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.280" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">specifically chose a moment when it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.870" end="00:25:40.090" style="s2">would maybe easier to to break down the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:42.370" style="s2">studio and to move it into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.090" end="00:25:44.500" style="s2">truck and also when there would be very</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.370" end="00:25:47.049" style="s2">likely no people around right but my</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.500" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">assumption is that the the space might</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.049" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">well be compromised absolutely so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:59.830" style="s2">what I want to get to when we&#39;re home</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">our assumption is that it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.830" end="00:26:04.510" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to be zero viral</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">particles here there are places we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.510" end="00:26:08.289" style="s2">talk about where viral particles might</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:12.130" style="s2">get through the door they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.289" end="00:26:14.169" style="s2">unlikely to infect us I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:16.090" style="s2">our house and I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.169" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">actually something that everybody needs</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.090" end="00:26:24.789" style="s2">to seek to do that if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:26.169" style="s2">the the cognitive load of some noise in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.789" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">the background if there&#39;s a air</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.169" end="00:26:29.860" style="s2">conditioner running you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:31.870" style="s2">that you&#39;re hearing it but as soon as it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.860" end="00:26:33.820" style="s2">goes off you feel the sense of relief</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.870" end="00:26:35.590" style="s2">like oh my goodness because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.820" end="00:26:37.570" style="s2">spending all of this processing power</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.590" end="00:26:40.510" style="s2">just getting rid of the noise of the air</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.570" end="00:26:42.610" style="s2">conditioner the viruses like that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.510" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">just feel jeopardy all the time to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:46.149" style="s2">extent that you can&#39;t sit down anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:48.279" style="s2">and be sure that the surface is clean</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.149" end="00:26:50.169" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly on alert and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.279" end="00:26:52.169" style="s2">really stressful which actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.169" end="00:26:54.669" style="s2">ironically makes you more vulnerable so</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.169" end="00:26:56.770" style="s2">figuring out how to get your house or</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.669" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">your apartment or wherever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.770" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">you&#39;re staying safe enough that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.070" style="s2">actually relax there is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.270" end="00:27:06.820" style="s2">health issue and an important one so</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.070" end="00:27:10.659" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been doing is when I get up</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.820" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">in the morning I take a bandana and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.659" end="00:27:19.000" style="s2">ordered 25 of them from Amazon weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.409" style="s2">knowing where we were and where we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.000" end="00:27:23.470" style="s2">headed</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.409" end="00:27:25.270" style="s2">and and weeks ago many many weeks ago it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.470" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">was already impossible to buy masks of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.270" end="00:27:30.940" style="s2">any sort locally even just a handful so</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:33.370" style="s2">when I get up I take a bandana and I put</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.940" end="00:27:35.049" style="s2">it on even though I&#39;m in the house and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.370" end="00:27:36.789" style="s2">know it&#39;s safe here but I just want it</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.049" end="00:27:38.500" style="s2">on so I don&#39;t have to go looking for it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.789" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">you don&#39;t you don&#39;t walk around that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.500" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">don&#39;t walk around the house I just put</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:44.860" style="s2">up to fit it I tie it on like this so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.860" end="00:27:46.570" style="s2">I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve got the right fit and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.860" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">I just pull it down around my neck if</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.570" end="00:27:51.010" style="s2">somebody comes to the door now</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">admittedly even UPS doesn&#39;t stick around</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.010" end="00:27:54.890" style="s2">the door any longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.370" end="00:27:57.289" style="s2">so I haven&#39;t in practice had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.890" end="00:27:59.150" style="s2">encounters with people but even if</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.289" end="00:28:00.289" style="s2">somebody were to come to the door it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.150" end="00:28:02.809" style="s2">right there and I don&#39;t have to think</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.289" end="00:28:04.250" style="s2">about you know going to get it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.809" end="00:28:05.750" style="s2">actually with there were some workmen</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.250" end="00:28:08.390" style="s2">here and I did use it with them</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.750" end="00:28:12.230" style="s2">but if I go to get some supplies or</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.390" end="00:28:14.419" style="s2">something I&#39;ll Drive with it down then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.230" end="00:28:17.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll pull it up before I go into some</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.419" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">place and I&#39;ll put on these safety</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.720" end="00:28:21.049" style="s2">glasses that have my reading</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.940" style="s2">prescription underneath now these also</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.049" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.940" end="00:28:27.320" style="s2">effective but they do have some coverage</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:29.299" style="s2">from the sides and the idea here is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.320" end="00:28:31.159" style="s2">any droplet I encounter if I walk</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.299" end="00:28:33.770" style="s2">through something a cloud that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.159" end="00:28:36.440" style="s2">has coughed out could it get in my eye</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.770" end="00:28:38.659" style="s2">sure is it likely - no because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.440" end="00:28:40.789" style="s2">very complex path to get past my glasses</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.659" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">so I&#39;ll walk around like this I actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.789" end="00:28:46.370" style="s2">have some cloth gloves I forgot to bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:48.860" style="s2">them here but I have some cloth gloves</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.370" end="00:28:50.299" style="s2">that I have multiple sets of I got them</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.860" end="00:28:52.010" style="s2">very cheap at a hardware store now</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.299" end="00:28:53.750" style="s2">they&#39;re not protective it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:56.510" style="s2">nitrile glove but it does mean if I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.750" end="00:28:59.899" style="s2">touch things that whatever gets on them</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.510" end="00:29:02.149" style="s2">gets on them and then I can take them</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.899" end="00:29:04.429" style="s2">off and as soon as I get back to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.149" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">vehicle I sanitize my hands before I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.429" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">start touching the steering wheel and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:10.970" style="s2">all that and then I you know pull this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">down and anyways you&#39;re done being out</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.970" end="00:29:14.659" style="s2">for the day as soon as you&#39;re done being</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.340" end="00:29:17.779" style="s2">out for the day you launder everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.659" end="00:29:21.770" style="s2">yeah as I walk through the door I drop</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.779" end="00:29:24.500" style="s2">my clothes in the laundry room and I go</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.770" end="00:29:26.059" style="s2">take a shower and this serves two</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.500" end="00:29:27.980" style="s2">important functions one if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.059" end="00:29:30.409" style="s2">encountered virus if it&#39;s in my hair</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.980" end="00:29:33.230" style="s2">because I walked through a cloud of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.409" end="00:29:36.740" style="s2">and didn&#39;t know this gets me back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.230" end="00:29:40.309" style="s2">baseline where I can again not infect me</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.740" end="00:29:43.970" style="s2">or my family and it means that I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.309" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">again feel that here I&#39;m safe right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.970" end="00:29:49.700" style="s2">that&#39;s an it&#39;s just an important factor</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:51.950" style="s2">and you know if I&#39;ve only been briefly</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.700" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">out and I don&#39;t feel like my clothes are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.950" end="00:29:55.370" style="s2">compromised and I&#39;m working I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:57.980" style="s2">touching things other people are going</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.370" end="00:29:59.990" style="s2">to touch if I left my clothes on I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.980" end="00:30:02.390" style="s2">still shower before I went to bed all</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.990" end="00:30:03.390" style="s2">right so bed is a place I&#39;m absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.390" end="00:30:05.010" style="s2">not going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.390" end="00:30:07.020" style="s2">you know drop some virus under the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.010" end="00:30:10.740" style="s2">pillow and get it into my eye or into</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.020" end="00:30:14.370" style="s2">heather&#39;s I so anyway it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.740" end="00:30:15.990" style="s2">method for both preventing infection and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.370" end="00:30:19.049" style="s2">it won&#39;t be a hundred percent effective</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.990" end="00:30:21.530" style="s2">but I bet it&#39;s highly effective and also</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.049" end="00:30:26.160" style="s2">for just creating a zone of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.530" end="00:30:31.049" style="s2">psychological safety where we spend most</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.160" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">of our time yeah good more to saying on</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.049" end="00:30:34.500" style="s2">masks no I think we&#39;re good I think you</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.179" end="00:30:37.799" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot else a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.500" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">too so you know on the on the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.799" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">rumors in a new window recently this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:46.380" style="s2">you know putting a hair dryer up your</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.950" end="00:30:48.630" style="s2">nose is not gonna cure coronavirus I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.380" end="00:30:50.669" style="s2">think the Florida Health official who</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.630" end="00:30:52.710" style="s2">advised that has apologized since but</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.669" end="00:30:54.500" style="s2">just in case you were wondering no</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.710" end="00:30:59.100" style="s2">that&#39;s more likely to kill you probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.500" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">and all chloroquine is not the same so</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.100" end="00:31:04.620" style="s2">do not do not imagine that if you hear a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:06.990" style="s2">report that suggests that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.620" end="00:31:10.410" style="s2">chloroquine which is and I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.990" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">hydrochloric one as well which is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:13.320" style="s2">anti malarial prophylaxis it works</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">against five acts but feltzer prime to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.320" end="00:31:17.850" style="s2">go back to that and I guess it&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">for lupus rheumatoid arthritis as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.850" end="00:31:27.419" style="s2">that drug which is already used in</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">humans is not it may be useful against</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.419" end="00:31:33.240" style="s2">kovat 19 maybe in combination with</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.350" style="s2">zithromax Arthur Ison as it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.240" end="00:31:36.690" style="s2">called maybe in combination with</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.350" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">something else but just because you find</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.690" end="00:31:39.990" style="s2">what does it clerk and phosphate on your</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:41.790" style="s2">aquarium cleaner does not mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.990" end="00:31:43.250" style="s2">should take that a couple of people one</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.790" end="00:31:47.790" style="s2">person died one person is in critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.250" end="00:31:51.510" style="s2">care from that so yeah am i right</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.790" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">zipper max does not have any activity</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.510" end="00:31:55.890" style="s2">against the virus as far as we know but</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:59.400" style="s2">the pneumonias that often travel with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.890" end="00:32:01.350" style="s2">are liable to be actually I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.400" end="00:32:03.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the cocktail of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.350" end="00:32:06.090" style="s2">Zithromax and some form of chloroquine</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.900" end="00:32:08.549" style="s2">that is thought to be effective or not</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.090" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure about that I think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.549" end="00:32:13.010" style="s2">think the the that their axes is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:15.740" style="s2">strictly about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.010" end="00:32:17.419" style="s2">than you yeah well so it&#39;s a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.740" end="00:32:19.190" style="s2">antibiotic that is used specifically for</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.419" end="00:32:23.750" style="s2">respiratory infections so it could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.190" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">yeah maybe we should talk about tests</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.750" end="00:32:29.150" style="s2">yeah and and and people being</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:31.610" style="s2">symptomatic and not symptomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.150" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">maybe go into before we go a society go</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.610" end="00:32:35.179" style="s2">into the personal story sure I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:37.640" style="s2">think that may be the right the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.179" end="00:32:40.610" style="s2">segue okay so an article in The</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.640" end="00:32:43.700" style="s2">Financial Times which is now pay wold</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.610" end="00:32:46.280" style="s2">so we can&#39;t show it to you suggested I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.700" end="00:32:49.010" style="s2">think it&#39;s today that half of Brits may</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.280" end="00:32:50.750" style="s2">already be infected if true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.010" end="00:32:52.760" style="s2">actually really good news right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.750" end="00:32:55.490" style="s2">means that the case fatality rate is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.760" end="00:32:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s still being reported is way higher</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.490" end="00:33:00.620" style="s2">than it actually is it does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.160" end="00:33:04.400" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t that we that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.620" end="00:33:06.610" style="s2">need to be in quarantine until we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.400" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">widespread testing so that we can know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.610" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">but that if true it&#39;s great but how do</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.610" style="s2">we know if it&#39;s true and I&#39;m so glad</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.690" end="00:33:18.140" style="s2">that the explanation is what you said</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.610" end="00:33:19.880" style="s2">because I thought when you said it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.140" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">really good news that you meant finally</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.880" end="00:33:23.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the Brits right where we want</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:27.049" style="s2">yes I&#39;m still holding a grudge all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.660" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">hundreds of years later I hope that my</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.049" end="00:33:34.010" style="s2">people were here then but right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:35.750" style="s2">once infected even if you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.010" end="00:33:38.390" style="s2">asymptomatic when you were infected and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.750" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that one of this viruses</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.390" end="00:33:43.640" style="s2">strategies and again we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:45.980" style="s2">strategy as this is this known term that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.640" end="00:33:48.620" style="s2">does not imply any consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.980" end="00:33:50.630" style="s2">it&#39;s simply effective evolutionarily one</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.620" end="00:33:53.630" style="s2">of the viruses strategies is to spread</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.630" end="00:33:56.150" style="s2">through asymptomatic carriers so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.630" end="00:33:57.980" style="s2">seems that likely everyone whether or</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.150" end="00:34:00.620" style="s2">not you become symptomatic or not who</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.980" end="00:34:02.030" style="s2">ends up infected with us has some period</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.620" end="00:34:04.280" style="s2">of time before they are symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.030" end="00:34:06.230" style="s2">during which they can transmit it so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.280" end="00:34:08.300" style="s2">everyone who ends up with this thing</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.060" end="00:34:16.220" style="s2">can then and can then think about where</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.330" end="00:34:17.840" style="s2">they where they were and perhaps contact</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.220" end="00:34:19.790" style="s2">those people but those people who never</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.310" end="00:34:31.590" style="s2">half of Great Britain is already</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.290" end="00:34:34.890" style="s2">infected this is probably right that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.590" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just been spreading far well we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.890" end="00:34:38.310" style="s2">know it&#39;s spreading fast but it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">spreading far earlier and more easily</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.310" end="00:34:45.510" style="s2">than we had any idea of so once infected</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:47.370" style="s2">if if you recover as the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.510" end="00:34:49.560" style="s2">of people do although some percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.370" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2">people who recover have will almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.560" end="00:34:54.330" style="s2">certainly have long-term lung and</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.330" end="00:34:57.330" style="s2">certainly immune</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.170" end="00:34:59.460" style="s2">now there&#39;s one report coming out of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.460" end="00:35:05.090" style="s2">that was tweeted at me yesterday and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:07.710" style="s2">can&#39;t find any other evidence of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.090" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">there&#39;s one report coming out the Taiwan</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.710" end="00:35:12.210" style="s2">Times sometime in February I think or</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.810" end="00:35:14.490" style="s2">maybe it was January suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.210" end="00:35:18.330" style="s2">repeated infections actually looked to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.490" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">be more at more risk of being fatal but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.330" end="00:35:23.610" style="s2">these were initial infections that were</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.040" end="00:35:25.020" style="s2">very bad and something it&#39;s unclear from</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.610" end="00:35:26.520" style="s2">the report if it&#39;s the drugs that those</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.020" end="00:35:27.750" style="s2">people were already on or the drugs that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.520" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">they were being given to treat the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.750" end="00:35:32.670" style="s2">infection caused heart damage which then</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:34.710" style="s2">meant that a second infection caused an</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.670" end="00:35:36.180" style="s2">immune response basically the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.710" end="00:35:39.270" style="s2">themselves were working against the body</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.180" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">now this would be alarming and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.270" end="00:35:43.020" style="s2">horrifying if true for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:44.610" style="s2">reasons and it would be a match for what</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.020" end="00:35:47.850" style="s2">we think is going on with dengue which</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.610" end="00:35:51.300" style="s2">is a like malaria another trop mostly</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.850" end="00:35:55.410" style="s2">tropical always malaria always mosquito</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.300" end="00:36:03.000" style="s2">vector disease so you can I think you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.410" end="00:36:04.350" style="s2">can take that town Zack sorry I got</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.000" end="00:36:09.570" style="s2">distracted by the picture of the corona</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.350" end="00:36:11.670" style="s2">virus so it Denton dengue it has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.570" end="00:36:13.710" style="s2">known for some time that if you get</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.670" end="00:36:15.300" style="s2">infected once you tend to be okay and if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.710" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">you get it a second time it can it can</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.300" end="00:36:21.210" style="s2">be fatal</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:23.820" style="s2">and it seems that at low and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.210" end="00:36:25.970" style="s2">intermediate antibody loads antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.820" end="00:36:28.290" style="s2">being the thing that your body produces</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.970" end="00:36:30.930" style="s2">they can then recognize future</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.290" end="00:36:32.610" style="s2">incidences of running into the pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.930" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2">in this case of virus not in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.610" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">dengue it&#39;s not a virus but in in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">future at low and intermediate antibody</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:44.940" style="s2">the inflammation that the antibody</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.270" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">response can actually cause can cause</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.940" end="00:36:47.790" style="s2">something like respiratory distress that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.700" style="s2">can kill you</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.790" end="00:36:52.650" style="s2">so if this is true it&#39;s super alarming</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.700" end="00:36:54.569" style="s2">we don&#39;t see a lot of evidence that this</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.650" end="00:36:57.000" style="s2">is true but that&#39;s something to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.569" end="00:36:58.559" style="s2">consider that said all the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.000" end="00:36:59.220" style="s2">evidence that I&#39;ve seen suggests that if</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.559" end="00:37:01.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve had it</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.220" end="00:37:03.720" style="s2">asymptomatic or not you now have</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.410" end="00:37:06.420" style="s2">immunity at least for a spell so for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.720" end="00:37:09.150" style="s2">spell as likely to mean immune to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">version of the virus that you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.150" end="00:37:14.430" style="s2">encountered because your immune system</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">recognizes it so quickly that you you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.430" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t get sick a second time one</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:22.940" style="s2">correction there are two things that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">body produces that will recognize a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.940" end="00:37:27.829" style="s2">pathogen on reinfection one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:32.369" style="s2">antibodies the other one is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.829" end="00:37:37.559" style="s2">receptors on the t-cells but neither</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.369" end="00:37:39.690" style="s2">here nor there really okay so oh so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.559" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">guess there are there are two types of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.690" end="00:37:46.970" style="s2">tests that we need to be widespread</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:50.970" style="s2">widespread easily available cheap and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.970" end="00:37:53.160" style="s2">and quick turnaround so what we know in</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.970" end="00:37:54.450" style="s2">the US and it seems like almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.160" end="00:37:56.369" style="s2">everywhere in the world with some</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.450" end="00:37:59.700" style="s2">important exceptions like tiny countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.369" end="00:38:01.380" style="s2">like Iceland there are not enough tests</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.700" end="00:38:02.970" style="s2">where the CDC is calling molecular</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.380" end="00:38:04.440" style="s2">verses serology tests I find this</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.970" end="00:38:06.359" style="s2">language confusing because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.440" end="00:38:08.849" style="s2">molecular tests but the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.359" end="00:38:14.040" style="s2">molecular tests are testing for active</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.849" end="00:38:16.559" style="s2">infection so we need a lot more testing</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.040" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">for anyone presenting with symptoms or</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.559" end="00:38:21.480" style="s2">for instance we just ran into yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">that apparently in nas mia loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.480" end="00:38:25.380" style="s2">sense of smell in the absence of other</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.510" style="s2">symptoms seems to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:29.460" style="s2">being a so-called asymptomatic carrier</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.510" end="00:38:32.579" style="s2">of this thing so if you&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.460" end="00:38:33.750" style="s2">the loss of smell or a partial loss of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.579" end="00:38:37.260" style="s2">the sense of taste which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.750" end="00:38:40.049" style="s2">largely smell it could be that you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.260" end="00:38:43.020" style="s2">carrying this thing we need tests to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.049" end="00:38:45.960" style="s2">test for active infection to allow those</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.020" end="00:38:48.359" style="s2">people who have it to be treated I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.960" end="00:38:51.329" style="s2">you should say that more strongly if in</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.359" end="00:38:52.770" style="s2">this context you had a son sudden</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.329" end="00:38:55.320" style="s2">unexplained loss</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.770" end="00:38:57.420" style="s2">of the sense of smell it is highly</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.320" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">likely that you are infected and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.420" end="00:39:02.490" style="s2">therefore you should take extreme</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:05.570" style="s2">measures not to pass it on and to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.490" end="00:39:08.310" style="s2">that you do what&#39;s necessary to recover</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.570" end="00:39:09.960" style="s2">so anyway you should behave accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.310" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got some other reason to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.960" end="00:39:14.070" style="s2">lost your sense of smell different and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:16.770" style="s2">different analysis but were you to lose</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.070" end="00:39:19.020" style="s2">it it would be a very strong indication</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.770" end="00:39:20.610" style="s2">absolutely so those are the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.020" end="00:39:22.470" style="s2">molecular tests and they&#39;re the tests</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.610" end="00:39:24.690" style="s2">that we&#39;re hearing almost exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.470" end="00:39:28.700" style="s2">about but what we also need is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.690" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">widespread abundant easy cheap or free</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.700" end="00:39:33.030" style="s2">serology testing which I prefer to call</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.290" style="s2">antibody testing because antibody is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.030" end="00:39:37.740" style="s2">word that most people have heard of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.290" end="00:39:39.600" style="s2">serology isn&#39;t so an antibody tests test</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.740" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">for whether or not your body has already</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.600" end="00:39:43.590" style="s2">created an immune response to the virus</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:45.150" style="s2">which would indicate that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.590" end="00:39:47.310" style="s2">exposed that you have had it whether or</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.150" end="00:39:49.140" style="s2">not you had symptoms and that if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.310" end="00:39:51.090" style="s2">right about those who have had it aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.140" end="00:39:54.180" style="s2">now immune for a spell you are now</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.090" end="00:39:56.040" style="s2">immune now imagine if if this</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.180" end="00:39:59.010" style="s2">epidemiological report reported in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.040" end="00:40:02.490" style="s2">financial times is right and and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.010" end="00:40:05.340" style="s2">was it 50 percent of yeah 50 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.490" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">people in Great Britain have already had</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.340" end="00:40:11.400" style="s2">it how useful would it be to know if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:13.050" style="s2">are in that 50 percent or not and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.400" end="00:40:15.590" style="s2">you can be put back to work right away</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.050" end="00:40:17.970" style="s2">we can get we can get economies running</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.590" end="00:40:20.280" style="s2">by knowing whether or not people have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.970" end="00:40:22.080" style="s2">had it or not so that actually means</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.280" end="00:40:24.870" style="s2">that Brits have us right where they want</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.080" end="00:40:28.050" style="s2">us yeah that&#39;s right this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.870" end="00:40:35.820" style="s2">probably this is the Brits you heard it</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.050" end="00:40:38.490" style="s2">here first and last okay so the serology</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.820" end="00:40:40.140" style="s2">testing antibody testing is also</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.490" end="00:40:42.210" style="s2">potentially quite useful there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.140" end="00:40:44.670" style="s2">technique being pushed through and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.210" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">Johns Hopkins now being pushed through</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.670" end="00:40:49.740" style="s2">regulations to pull plasma from people</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2">who test positive for the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.740" end="00:40:53.850" style="s2">which can then be used in only a couple</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:57.060" style="s2">of patients so it wouldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.850" end="00:40:59.880" style="s2">use the plasma of one person who has had</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.060" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">and recovered from Kovan 19 and used it</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.880" end="00:41:03.840" style="s2">to treat hundreds of patients but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">know about 1 to 2 ratio you could use it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.840" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">to at least potentially confer</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:10.470" style="s2">partial or temporary immunity to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">healthcare workers or potentially to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.470" end="00:41:15.030" style="s2">boost response in the very sick so this</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:19.140" style="s2">would be akin to the use of gamma</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.030" end="00:41:21.090" style="s2">globulin in malarial context yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.140" end="00:41:24.570" style="s2">these are antibodies to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.090" end="00:41:28.440" style="s2">antigen yeah so did you say the serology</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.570" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">test has the advantage of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.440" end="00:41:32.820" style="s2">tell you that you were exposed even if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.980" style="s2">you&#39;re no longer sick if you&#39;ve defeated</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.820" end="00:41:36.660" style="s2">the virus internally it will still</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.980" end="00:41:39.300" style="s2">register a positive which is both good</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.660" end="00:41:41.220" style="s2">and bad because and in fact it will not</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.300" end="00:41:43.980" style="s2">register a positive for some number of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.220" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">days after you&#39;ve been infected so your</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.980" end="00:41:49.740" style="s2">antibody load climbs I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">something like 14 days after you were at</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.740" end="00:41:53.790" style="s2">your sickest if you were symptomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:41:56.910" style="s2">so the serology tests are actually more</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.790" end="00:41:58.410" style="s2">accurate a week or two out which makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.910" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">perfect sense because the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.410" end="00:42:02.280" style="s2">you get sick in the first place is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:04.140" style="s2">your immune system doesn&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.280" end="00:42:06.030" style="s2">formulas and Counting and encountering a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.140" end="00:42:08.250" style="s2">novel phenomenon and it takes time for</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.030" end="00:42:10.950" style="s2">it to figure out molecular ly what that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.250" end="00:42:13.020" style="s2">phenomenon looks like and so if you test</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.950" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">for the antibodies to the virus and your</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.020" end="00:42:16.860" style="s2">system has never seen that virus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:19.470" style="s2">going to take you know days to a week</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.860" end="00:42:21.240" style="s2">for for the the test to register or</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.470" end="00:42:23.040" style="s2">positive because you just simply don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.240" end="00:42:25.260" style="s2">have any buddies yet that are specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:26.460" style="s2">enough exactly let me just be clear also</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.260" end="00:42:28.230" style="s2">that these Mallick the so called</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.460" end="00:42:30.840" style="s2">molecular tests which test for active</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.230" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">infection and the antibody tests also</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.840" end="00:42:36.120" style="s2">known as the serology test which tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:37.620" style="s2">for prior exposure and yourself having</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.120" end="00:42:40.650" style="s2">created an immune response within your</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.620" end="00:42:42.990" style="s2">body molecular tests antibody tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.650" end="00:42:45.030" style="s2">actually will not work at the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.990" end="00:42:46.440" style="s2">moment in infection so there are some</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.030" end="00:42:48.450" style="s2">number of people on the planet right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.440" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">who have not been exposed who will who</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.450" end="00:42:51.720" style="s2">would test negative for either of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:53.370" style="s2">things there&#39;s some number people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.720" end="00:42:55.230" style="s2">have active infection right now and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.370" end="00:42:57.330" style="s2">would test positive for molecular tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.230" end="00:42:59.730" style="s2">but not yet positive for serology tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.330" end="00:43:02.130" style="s2">and then there are probably far more</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.730" end="00:43:04.320" style="s2">people actually who have been exposed</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.130" end="00:43:05.790" style="s2">who have recovered many of whom may not</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.320" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">even have known they were sick</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.790" end="00:43:11.850" style="s2">who would test positive for an antibody</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:16.140" style="s2">test a serology tests but serology tests</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.850" end="00:43:17.940" style="s2">are not being done yet we don&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:19.820" style="s2">number I saw suggested five or six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.940" end="00:43:22.250" style="s2">yet before their widespread</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.820" end="00:43:25.670" style="s2">they they are likely the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.250" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">both the economic and the health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.670" end="00:43:28.490" style="s2">and they&#39;re not the complete solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:31.160" style="s2">but they are a big part of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.490" end="00:43:33.350" style="s2">so they&#39;re a key piece so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.160" end="00:43:34.730" style="s2">say that I you know I&#39;m not able to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.350" end="00:43:38.390" style="s2">the whole stream as it&#39;s going by of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.730" end="00:43:40.430" style="s2">course but when you hear numbers like</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:43.010" style="s2">well you know Seattle tested or New York</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.430" end="00:43:45.380" style="s2">tested and ninety percent of the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.010" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2">they tested came back negative that does</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.380" end="00:43:48.950" style="s2">not mean that those ninety percent of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.240" end="00:43:51.260" style="s2">people that they tested have not been</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.950" end="00:43:52.930" style="s2">exposed and have never had it that what</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.260" end="00:43:56.540" style="s2">that means is that they aren&#39;t currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.930" end="00:43:58.940" style="s2">infected with with this coronavirus so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.540" end="00:44:01.190" style="s2">saw somebody made the right distinction</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.940" end="00:44:02.810" style="s2">in the chat the way to refer to it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.190" end="00:44:05.090" style="s2">probably how we should refer to it with</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.810" end="00:44:07.250" style="s2">each other is antigen versus antibody</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.090" end="00:44:10.070" style="s2">right let&#39;s go you&#39;re testing for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.250" end="00:44:11.930" style="s2">antibody you&#39;re testing your the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.070" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">your immune system having understood</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.930" end="00:44:17.290" style="s2">wedeck&#39;s up against the antigen being</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:20.390" style="s2">pathogen antibody being our response to</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.290" end="00:44:22.280" style="s2">pathogen our molecular signatures that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.390" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">are particular to the path again so your</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:27.290" style="s2">own cells will have these viral markers</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">on them as a result of being infected</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.290" end="00:44:33.350" style="s2">yeah all right so we talked about our</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:35.360" style="s2">yeah I guess so we definitely want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.350" end="00:44:37.780" style="s2">get to talking about society what how</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.360" end="00:44:41.810" style="s2">much time are we in at this point Zack</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.780" end="00:44:44.030" style="s2">yeah okay well well we will we will be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.810" end="00:44:45.940" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna continue a bit here but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.030" end="00:44:49.340" style="s2">will be back again in a few days as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.940" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">so boy I haven&#39;t practiced how I tell</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.340" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">this story I&#39;m gonna be as brief as</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:57.770" style="s2">possible and if people want more details</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">maybe actually if can I introduce her</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.770" end="00:45:02.360" style="s2">okay so a few days ago no maybe a week</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:04.520" style="s2">ago that&#39;s a week ago at this point um</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.360" end="00:45:09.470" style="s2">Heather came to me and said I have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.520" end="00:45:15.140" style="s2">hypothesis for you um is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.470" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">that I already had kovat 19 she had been</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.140" end="00:45:21.770" style="s2">quite sick with something we took to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:24.050" style="s2">flu and at the time I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.770" end="00:45:26.780" style="s2">almost no chance that you had it because</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.050" end="00:45:29.870" style="s2">it was so rare in the u.s. at the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.780" end="00:45:33.140" style="s2">that the chances of having encountered</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.870" end="00:45:35.300" style="s2">somebody with it virtually ruled it out</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.140" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">that said there were other things about</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.300" end="00:45:43.580" style="s2">what Heather had which then Zach our son</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:48.500" style="s2">picked up that matched so well the set</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.580" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">of symptoms and the let&#39;s say the level</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.500" end="00:45:56.120" style="s2">of sickness that both Heather and Zach</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">had was quite alarming in fact I thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.120" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">about taking Zach to the hospital at one</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:02.390" style="s2">point he just sort of seemed to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:03.860" style="s2">lost it was a joke at the time because</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.390" end="00:46:05.870" style="s2">we thought he had the flu and would</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.860" end="00:46:07.550" style="s2">certainly recover but he seemed to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.870" end="00:46:13.730" style="s2">lost his will to live he was just</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.550" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">completely flattened so anyway yeah let</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.730" end="00:46:17.960" style="s2">me let me walk through a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.260" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">why I&#39;m I&#39;ve also checked my logic</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.960" end="00:46:22.670" style="s2">against a couple of public health</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:24.890" style="s2">friends and they agree that this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.670" end="00:46:26.510" style="s2">almost certainly and I we can&#39;t know we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.890" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know because there is no antibody</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.510" end="00:46:33.050" style="s2">testing available to us yet but I was in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.140" end="00:46:36.740" style="s2">LA where it seems that it probably was</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.050" end="00:46:40.580" style="s2">present earlier than anyone is saying is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:42.830" style="s2">clear that we have been data has been</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.580" end="00:46:45.080" style="s2">kept from us and we&#39;ve probably actively</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.830" end="00:46:47.930" style="s2">been lied to by many sources from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.080" end="00:46:51.740" style="s2">beginning of this thing so I was in LA</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.930" end="00:46:54.620" style="s2">between February 6th and 11th came back</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.740" end="00:46:56.030" style="s2">that night started coughing I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.620" end="00:46:58.310" style="s2">sitting on the couch with Breton or two</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.030" end="00:47:02.540" style="s2">boys and commented that&#39;s a weird cough</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.310" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">why am i coughing so suddenly middle of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.540" end="00:47:06.920" style="s2">the night I&#39;m coughing more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.900" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling wretched we are lucky enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.920" end="00:47:12.170" style="s2">to be in a situation in our house where</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.900" end="00:47:14.810" style="s2">we have a spare bed with a guest bed but</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.170" end="00:47:16.010" style="s2">I just gotten home and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.810" end="00:47:17.720" style="s2">wake but Brett up in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.010" end="00:47:18.500" style="s2">night and say you need to you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.720" end="00:47:22.040" style="s2">switch bedrooms</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.500" end="00:47:23.960" style="s2">so Brett spent a night sleeping next to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.040" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">me when I was coughing by the time I got</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.960" end="00:47:33.290" style="s2">up I said well I&#39;m I&#39;m really really</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:35.720" style="s2">sick and and I cancelled a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.290" end="00:47:38.030" style="s2">plans that I had for the day and I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.720" end="00:47:39.940" style="s2">just flattened totally flattened for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.030" end="00:47:43.550" style="s2">day coughing the only thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.940" end="00:47:45.410" style="s2">that seemed likely to do any good for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.550" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">was to sit in a hot bath which I did for</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.410" end="00:47:47.890" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.619" style="s2">and and otherwise I was just lying in</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.890" end="00:47:53.080" style="s2">bed Brett went to dinner with the people</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.619" end="00:47:54.730" style="s2">we&#39;d had plans with that evening having</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.080" end="00:47:57.099" style="s2">since you moved out of the bedroom and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.730" end="00:47:59.050" style="s2">effectively we&#39;re lucky to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.099" end="00:48:00.550" style="s2">quarantine each of us if we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.050" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">within the house so actually I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.550" end="00:48:05.380" style="s2">return to this maybe yeah next time but</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:07.030" style="s2">this has been policy in our house where</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.380" end="00:48:10.390" style="s2">we treat infectious disease very</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.030" end="00:48:12.490" style="s2">seriously because just the for a number</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.390" end="00:48:16.930" style="s2">of reasons but anyway when somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.490" end="00:48:19.210" style="s2">sick one of us is sick we separate so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.930" end="00:48:20.560" style="s2">don&#39;t sleep next to each other and but</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.210" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">you spend a night sleeping next to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.560" end="00:48:26.140" style="s2">and because Brett was out that night i</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:28.750" style="s2">roused myself that are barely and sat</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.140" end="00:48:30.760" style="s2">with our two boys as they ate dinner and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.750" end="00:48:33.369" style="s2">I took my temperature at that point and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.760" end="00:48:36.460" style="s2">it was 102 I don&#39;t know okay yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.369" end="00:48:38.320" style="s2">really I really am sick I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.460" end="00:48:40.450" style="s2">broke the fever that night it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.320" end="00:48:41.770" style="s2">felt like it but when I took my</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.450" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">temperature again 24 hours later it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.770" end="00:48:44.470" style="s2">still 102</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">I mean while the coughing can go on for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.470" end="00:48:48.040" style="s2">half an hour at a time</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:51.339" style="s2">the only thing that seems to relieve the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.040" end="00:48:54.190" style="s2">pain and the pressure at all is is hot</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.339" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">steamed lemon honey tea which you made</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.190" end="00:48:59.980" style="s2">for me and baths and showers</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:02.560" style="s2">no no throat involvement which is rare</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.980" end="00:49:06.970" style="s2">for me when I get sick no just um ik no</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.560" end="00:49:10.770" style="s2">sneezing coughing fever and I&#39;m you know</p>

<p begin="00:49:10.770" end="00:49:18.580" style="s2">50 year old woman and female is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.880" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">protective against this and also being</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.580" end="00:49:21.880" style="s2">in good health with no underlying</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:23.410" style="s2">conditions my age being really the only</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.880" end="00:49:26.349" style="s2">thing that I know of that puts me at</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.410" end="00:49:28.030" style="s2">some higher risk there&#39;s there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.349" end="00:49:31.780" style="s2">that story and I&#39;ll say one more one</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.030" end="00:49:34.450" style="s2">more detail here about my experience but</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.780" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">I also want to say that two days into me</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.450" end="00:49:40.510" style="s2">being sick Zach gets sick he&#39;s 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:42.099" style="s2">old he is an extraordinary health he has</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.510" end="00:49:44.920" style="s2">no underlying conditions none of us are</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.099" end="00:49:48.490" style="s2">on any pharmaceuticals and he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.920" end="00:49:50.140" style="s2">get sick and this boy was flattened and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.490" end="00:49:53.530" style="s2">he had a hundred four degree fever he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:55.869" style="s2">coughing and Brett almost took him to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.530" end="00:49:57.310" style="s2">the hospital this is before we had any</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.869" end="00:49:58.540" style="s2">thought of it being cope at night yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.310" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.540" end="00:50:03.070" style="s2">any reports of hospitalizations for</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">people under 20 I think and here is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.070" end="00:50:07.720" style="s2">incredibly healthy 15 year old who was</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:10.869" style="s2">totally flattened by this thing for four</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.720" end="00:50:12.910" style="s2">days so here&#39;s one other thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.869" end="00:50:14.350" style="s2">think is relevant for people if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.910" end="00:50:17.020" style="s2">think they might have this because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.350" end="00:50:18.790" style="s2">seen glimmerings anecdotal stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.020" end="00:50:21.130" style="s2">otherwise to this effect</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.790" end="00:50:25.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve still got with this file this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.130" end="00:50:27.460" style="s2">like five weeks later that 96 hours</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.690" end="00:50:30.310" style="s2">almost to the hour like four days</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.460" end="00:50:33.970" style="s2">exactly after beginning to get sick on</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.310" end="00:50:35.859" style="s2">the 15th I was in the shower and I had</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.970" end="00:50:38.350" style="s2">the sort of step function improvement in</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.859" end="00:50:40.510" style="s2">health like and I am not all the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.350" end="00:50:42.369" style="s2">better but I feel like I&#39;m gonna live</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.510" end="00:50:44.500" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t ever think I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.369" end="00:50:46.150" style="s2">die but I Wow</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.500" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">do I feel like okay I&#39;ve just rounded</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.150" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">the corner and in a way that usually you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:51.310" style="s2">don&#39;t with sickness you feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:52.359" style="s2">little better when you wake up maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.310" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2">this really felt like a step function</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.359" end="00:50:58.119" style="s2">and so that was the evening of Friday</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:51:01.150" style="s2">the 15th no Saturday the 15th we had</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.980" end="00:51:21.609" style="s2">days before Brecon come back in but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.420" end="00:51:24.670" style="s2">feeling much better let&#39;s get these news</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.609" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">what are you sheets off here Zack was by</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.670" end="00:51:28.990" style="s2">now doing a little bit better he was</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:32.200" style="s2">still sick but we felt okay to leave him</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.990" end="00:51:34.450" style="s2">home alone while Brett and I and our</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.200" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">younger son went to have dinner with our</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.450" end="00:51:40.600" style="s2">friend at dinner I started coughing so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:42.160" style="s2">furiously that I had to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.600" end="00:51:44.320" style="s2">restaurant I stood outside coughing for</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.160" end="00:51:47.950" style="s2">ten minutes and this happened twice more</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.320" end="00:51:49.300" style="s2">and I thought I what what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.950" end="00:51:52.330" style="s2">this this is unlike anything else I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.300" end="00:51:54.940" style="s2">ever experienced and it was hard to walk</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.330" end="00:51:56.980" style="s2">back to the car and by the time we got</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.940" end="00:51:58.540" style="s2">home I had stripped the bed but the</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.980" end="00:52:00.430" style="s2">laundry hadn&#39;t been ready so I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.540" end="00:52:02.650" style="s2">made the bed Brett and I were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.430" end="00:52:04.930" style="s2">make the bed and I I couldn&#39;t I actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.650" end="00:52:06.190" style="s2">could not stand up I I fell to my knees</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.930" end="00:52:09.819" style="s2">and then I had to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.190" end="00:52:11.230" style="s2">and I could not do it and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.819" end="00:52:12.940" style="s2">if it was that night or the next night</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.230" end="00:52:14.530" style="s2">so Brett did not sleep nice to me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.940" end="00:52:16.359" style="s2">night of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.530" end="00:52:17.500" style="s2">so Brett finished making the bed and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.359" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">was either in the middle of that night</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.500" end="00:52:22.660" style="s2">or the next night that I woke up</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:24.039" style="s2">asphyxiating like for the only time</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.660" end="00:52:27.039" style="s2">during this really actually feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.039" end="00:52:30.520" style="s2">I was going to die and like I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.039" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">unable to get breath the alarming thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.520" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">about this and it only happened once and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:37.750" style="s2">I obviously did not die but the alarming</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:40.420" style="s2">thing to me about this is the having</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.750" end="00:52:42.549" style="s2">felt so much better that I went out into</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.420" end="00:52:43.630" style="s2">the world that I thought I was over it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.549" end="00:52:45.400" style="s2">that I went out into the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.630" end="00:52:47.260" style="s2">potentially exposed not just our friend</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.400" end="00:52:49.539" style="s2">but a whole restaurant full of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.260" end="00:52:51.720" style="s2">because I thought I was better and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.539" end="00:52:54.309" style="s2">know as soon as I was coughing I</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.720" end="00:52:56.140" style="s2">extricated myself again there was no</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.309" end="00:52:59.410" style="s2">thought that this was Co vat19 we had</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.140" end="00:53:03.069" style="s2">heard of Kovac 19 at this point when we</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.410" end="00:53:05.799" style="s2">emerged from the Amazon there was</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.069" end="00:53:08.230" style="s2">thought to be one case in Ecuador and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.799" end="00:53:09.819" style="s2">it made the the news in Ecuador and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.230" end="00:53:11.710" style="s2">was our first encounter with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.819" end="00:53:13.690" style="s2">concept yeah this is late January we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.710" end="00:53:16.170" style="s2">been in the Amazon and Internet free</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.690" end="00:53:18.700" style="s2">field station for a couple of weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.170" end="00:53:21.130" style="s2">we came out we heard about it and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.700" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve been tracking it since then and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.130" end="00:53:25.450" style="s2">really was a week ago</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:27.250" style="s2">that I put together you know what at</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.450" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">some level given how much misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.250" end="00:53:32.410" style="s2">disinformation there is out there about</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:36.309" style="s2">what this is where it&#39;s been when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.410" end="00:53:38.829" style="s2">been and how bad it&#39;s been why do why is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.309" end="00:53:42.460" style="s2">the only thing that isn&#39;t a match for</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.829" end="00:53:45.640" style="s2">what I&#39;ve experienced and what this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.460" end="00:53:48.549" style="s2">is the timing but la in early</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.640" end="00:53:51.490" style="s2">mid-february could could well have been</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.549" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">a source well and you know within two</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.490" end="00:53:55.779" style="s2">days of you&#39;re having floated this idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:58.059" style="s2">that maybe it was Cove in 19 and my</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.779" end="00:54:00.099" style="s2">having dismissed it evidence emerged</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.059" end="00:54:02.260" style="s2">though you didn&#39;t dismiss it well no I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.099" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">dismissed it on the basis that it was so</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.260" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">unlikely you would have contracted it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">that then two days later evidence</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:12.609" style="s2">emerged that in fact there were a great</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:14.650" style="s2">many more cases in January then we had</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.609" end="00:54:17.049" style="s2">understood and suddenly everything fell</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.650" end="00:54:19.570" style="s2">into place so we don&#39;t know that you had</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.049" end="00:54:21.700" style="s2">it but it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.570" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">likely and then that raises a question</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.700" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">about me and our other son</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.430" end="00:54:30.070" style="s2">exactly Toby yes I felt I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:32.740" style="s2">historically been pretty susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.070" end="00:54:36.310" style="s2">respiratory illness and when you guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.740" end="00:54:40.360" style="s2">got sick I felt certain that I was going</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.310" end="00:54:43.240" style="s2">to get it and I was extremely careful</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.360" end="00:54:45.250" style="s2">but I it struck me as very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.240" end="00:54:47.140" style="s2">I would be able to be careful enough in</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.250" end="00:54:49.990" style="s2">the same house as the two of you as sick</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.140" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">as you were and not get it and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.990" end="00:54:56.110" style="s2">actually had a little celebration at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:55:00.190" style="s2">point that we were 14 days from our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.110" end="00:55:05.260" style="s2">first exposure from know from your both</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.190" end="00:55:07.360" style="s2">being recovered because at that point we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.260" end="00:55:10.540" style="s2">were pretty sure somehow Toby and I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.360" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">avoided it now at this point let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.540" end="00:55:16.390" style="s2">it was Kovac 19 we don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">Toby and I had it and were asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.390" end="00:55:27.690" style="s2">and going out into the world right I</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">have type O+ blood and type O blood is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.690" end="00:55:32.350" style="s2">protective so it&#39;s possible I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:33.880" style="s2">it because my blood is protective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.350" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">possible I had it and was asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.880" end="00:55:39.130" style="s2">but this is a hold on let&#39;s just flag</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:41.710" style="s2">that that type O blood there&#39;s eight</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.130" end="00:55:43.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a paper out sac I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.710" end="00:55:46.630" style="s2">you want to put it up you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.090" end="00:55:49.690" style="s2">it&#39;s the sow at all 2020 paper that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.630" end="00:55:51.670" style="s2">suggests that the and this was out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.690" end="00:55:57.310" style="s2">China this is in Chinese hospitals I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.670" end="00:56:00.060" style="s2">think that people with a b and b blood</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.310" end="00:56:04.180" style="s2">types had about the expected risk of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.060" end="00:56:06.100" style="s2">susceptibility to cope at 19 people with</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.180" end="00:56:07.810" style="s2">type O blood had lower than expected</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.100" end="00:56:10.660" style="s2">risk of people with type A blood has</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.810" end="00:56:12.700" style="s2">slightly higher and it&#39;s those those are</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.660" end="00:56:14.470" style="s2">statistically significant results but</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:15.940" style="s2">they aren&#39;t extreme it&#39;s not the people</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.470" end="00:56:17.560" style="s2">with type O blood never get it or the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.940" end="00:56:21.670" style="s2">people with type A blood always get it</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.560" end="00:56:24.090" style="s2">this is somewhat protective so to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.670" end="00:56:27.010" style="s2">back to your earlier point about testing</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.090" end="00:56:28.930" style="s2">we are now stuck in a situation I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.010" end="00:56:31.330" style="s2">you can see we think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.930" end="00:56:32.790" style="s2">decent chance that everybody in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.330" end="00:56:35.430" style="s2">family has had the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.790" end="00:56:37.740" style="s2">already which would render us largely</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.430" end="00:56:39.960" style="s2">protected you can see how careful were</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.740" end="00:56:42.840" style="s2">being anyway though I mean the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.960" end="00:56:45.360" style="s2">we&#39;re taking no chances we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.840" end="00:56:47.430" style="s2">this very seriously even though we now</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.360" end="00:56:49.740" style="s2">are doing so with the thought that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.430" end="00:56:51.000" style="s2">even if we do encounter it we won&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.740" end="00:56:55.470" style="s2">down with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.000" end="00:57:01.170" style="s2">but how useful would it be to know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.470" end="00:57:03.030" style="s2">we were passed kovat 19 to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.170" end="00:57:04.560" style="s2">that there is concern out there and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.030" end="00:57:07.140" style="s2">there&#39;s this mean which I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.560" end="00:57:10.050" style="s2">encountered yet I&#39;ve been too busy to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.140" end="00:57:11.910" style="s2">spending any time doing even the due</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.050" end="00:57:14.690" style="s2">diligence I should be doing online but</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.910" end="00:57:18.030" style="s2">to the extent that people are now</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.690" end="00:57:20.850" style="s2">recognizing a trade-off between you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.030" end="00:57:23.850" style="s2">protecting the elderly and protecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.850" end="00:57:26.280" style="s2">the economy for example how important</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.850" end="00:57:28.470" style="s2">might it be to know who it is who has</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.280" end="00:57:30.900" style="s2">passed this and can actually be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.470" end="00:57:32.430" style="s2">and you know intervene where others</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.900" end="00:57:35.220" style="s2">would fear to tread</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.430" end="00:57:37.260" style="s2">that&#39;s our so if if it is if it has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.220" end="00:57:40.260" style="s2">spreading through the US and the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.260" end="00:57:42.750" style="s2">weird countries for several months</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.260" end="00:57:45.360" style="s2">there are a lot of us who have it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.750" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t know and could be usefully</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.360" end="00:57:50.040" style="s2">contributing to the economy and to our</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:53.250" style="s2">own individual success and I mean let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.040" end="00:57:57.330" style="s2">say you know one of our parents got sick</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.250" end="00:58:02.430" style="s2">right if our parents got sick we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.330" end="00:58:03.870" style="s2">not afford to go into their space to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.430" end="00:58:06.030" style="s2">take care of them or we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.870" end="00:58:08.370" style="s2">think very carefully about how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.030" end="00:58:10.770" style="s2">because we would be putting other people</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.370" end="00:58:13.260" style="s2">at risk should we contract it you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.770" end="00:58:16.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very tough puzzle but if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.260" end="00:58:19.560" style="s2">know that we&#39;ve had it then it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.200" end="00:58:20.820" style="s2">obvious thing to do so anyway there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.560" end="00:58:23.850" style="s2">a lot of predicaments that could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.820" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">resolved if we simply knew where in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.850" end="00:58:28.320" style="s2">progression of this you are are you</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:33.050" style="s2">vulnerable are you passed it and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.320" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">anyway the complete failure of our</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.050" end="00:58:39.510" style="s2">governmental apparatus to deliver us</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:42.770" style="s2">both quality information and tests</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.510" end="00:58:45.450" style="s2">capable of telling us in which category</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.770" end="00:58:47.730" style="s2">we individually are</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.450" end="00:58:49.560" style="s2">is inexcusable those are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.730" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">allow you to navigate this intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.560" end="00:58:56.609" style="s2">and and it&#39;s just unacceptable that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:59:00.660" style="s2">have no that is we need we need data we</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.609" end="00:59:03.240" style="s2">need we need to know to to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.660" end="00:59:04.890" style="s2">possible where all of us stand with</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.240" end="00:59:07.619" style="s2">regard to past infection</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.890" end="00:59:09.930" style="s2">obviously current infection but all all</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.619" end="00:59:11.970" style="s2">of the discussions about testing almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.930" end="00:59:15.270" style="s2">in the media and from the government are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.970" end="00:59:18.060" style="s2">about tests that are only looking at</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.270" end="00:59:20.910" style="s2">current infection and you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.060" end="00:59:22.530" style="s2">those to restart the economy the people</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.910" end="00:59:23.849" style="s2">who are so sick that they are now being</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.530" end="00:59:26.010" style="s2">tested since they&#39;re in such short</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.849" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">supply are not going to be the ones</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.010" end="00:59:30.089" style="s2">going back to work anytime soon you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">a whole lot of people and we have no</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.089" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">idea how many we have no idea even what</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:37.380" style="s2">order of magnitude number of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:40.170" style="s2">there are who are now almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.380" end="00:59:42.869" style="s2">recovered were asymptomatic have</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.170" end="00:59:45.180" style="s2">antibodies are immune at least for some</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.869" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">time and could be back at work that does</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.180" end="00:59:49.829" style="s2">not mean that we can release quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:51.480" style="s2">that we should not be sheltering in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.829" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">place all of these things for now</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.480" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">because without the information</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:59.300" style="s2">loosening up these strictures that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="01:00:02.369" style="s2">all living under now would be calamitous</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.300" end="01:00:04.290" style="s2">alright other things you want to include</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.369" end="01:00:06.540" style="s2">here are some more to say but maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.290" end="01:00:10.290" style="s2">should say we&#39;ll be back in a couple</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.540" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">days what&#39;s up one hour now okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.290" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">unless I mean we could do let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:16.800" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s skip the society for now</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:18.420" style="s2">let&#39;s go let&#39;s go back to there do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.800" end="01:00:26.490" style="s2">want it do you want to do that now yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.420" end="01:00:27.900" style="s2">if society know so what should what</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.490" end="01:00:30.780" style="s2">should individuals be doing now and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.900" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.780" end="01:00:37.410" style="s2">societal impacts and such in a few days</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:40.770" style="s2">couple few days yes we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.410" end="01:00:42.750" style="s2">socially distancing and if if you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.770" end="01:00:45.000" style="s2">when you&#39;re out be wearing masks be</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.750" end="01:00:48.810" style="s2">wearing eye protection this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.000" end="01:00:51.720" style="s2">thing but that does not mean staying in</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.810" end="01:00:54.329" style="s2">your home and some number of people live</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:36.000" style="s2">that the body will tell you often what</p>

<p begin="01:02:48.600" end="01:02:52.680" style="s2">afterwards just ate you know eight or</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.100" end="01:02:54.150" style="s2">ten tangerines and oranges a day so if</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.800" end="01:02:59.670" style="s2">citrus and hopefully you have it in your</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.230" end="01:03:01.380" style="s2">home already and if you have to go out</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.670" end="01:03:04.770" style="s2">do a big shop and try to go out more</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.380" end="01:03:06.750" style="s2">than once a week etc but if you have</p>

<p begin="01:03:09.329" end="01:03:12.660" style="s2">is that you always want pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.430" end="01:03:19.130" style="s2">those there&#39;s a good chance that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:03:21.660" end="01:03:29.059" style="s2">place is good epidemiological advice it</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.709" end="01:03:31.739" style="s2">has many consequences most of us are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.059" end="01:03:33.329" style="s2">you know cabin fever is a real thing and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.739" end="01:03:36.450" style="s2">it is going to compound the problem so</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.329" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">Heather is right you&#39;re the outdoors are</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.450" end="01:03:42.150" style="s2">your friend if you can stay away from</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">other people I mean six feet isn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.150" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">can certainly have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:46.680" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">Peter big ocean and I went bird-watching</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.680" end="01:03:53.910" style="s2">the other day but it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:55.619" style="s2">definitely an important thing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.910" end="01:03:57.660" style="s2">consider which is how are you going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.619" end="01:03:59.969" style="s2">keep yourself feeling like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.660" end="01:04:04.469" style="s2">just simply cooped up hiding from an</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.969" end="01:04:07.229" style="s2">enemy outside your house in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.469" end="01:04:12.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve got tools that are at our disposal</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.229" end="01:04:15.029" style="s2">that are extremely valuable I mean how</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.150" end="01:04:17.880" style="s2">much more isolating would this be if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.029" end="01:04:20.549" style="s2">know the internet resources were not</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.880" end="01:04:23.549" style="s2">available to us and in fact I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.549" end="01:04:25.769" style="s2">there&#39;s an argument to be made that our</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.549" end="01:04:26.539" style="s2">ability to interact with each other over</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.769" end="01:04:29.369" style="s2">the Internet</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.539" end="01:04:31.829" style="s2">offers some relief here because there</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.369" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">are lots of things that we can use to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.829" end="01:04:37.680" style="s2">substitute for the kinds of interactions</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:38.630" style="s2">that we would have in person outside of</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.680" end="01:04:41.579" style="s2">this epidemic</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.630" end="01:04:45.569" style="s2">so anyway consider what those might be</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.579" end="01:04:48.150" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of starting something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.569" end="01:04:51.390" style="s2">a campfire a virtual campfire where</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.150" end="01:04:53.549" style="s2">people gather using some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.390" end="01:04:55.549" style="s2">streaming service in order to just stay</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.549" end="01:04:59.339" style="s2">in sync with other people and to</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.549" end="01:05:01.109" style="s2">brainstorm ideas for what to think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.339" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">what we&#39;re facing but anyway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.109" end="01:05:06.299" style="s2">lots available to us just one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:08.579" style="s2">we saw a number of questions that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.299" end="01:05:10.199" style="s2">haven&#39;t addressed both certainly we</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.579" end="01:05:12.719" style="s2">missed almost everything that stroll to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.199" end="01:05:14.059" style="s2">the stream here but that we saw on</p>

<p begin="01:05:14.059" end="01:05:18.420" style="s2">one question that I saw come up several</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.259" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">times was the status of the book that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.420" end="01:05:22.180" style="s2">we&#39;re writing so let me say that we we</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.570" end="01:05:32.520" style="s2">and it is a hunter-gatherers guide to</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:34.950" style="s2">the 21st century and</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.520" end="01:05:37.250" style="s2">this kind of thinking around you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.950" end="01:05:40.050" style="s2">what to eat what to do how to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.250" end="01:05:42.420" style="s2">including up to Society level stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.050" end="01:05:45.000" style="s2">which will begin to get to a little bit</p>
