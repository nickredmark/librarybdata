<p begin="00:00:46.970" end="00:00:51.170" style="s2">is probably the single most important</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.380" end="00:00:59.780" style="s2">lives but all of them rely on a steady</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.590" end="00:01:02.210" style="s2">supply of money and so if you&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.060" end="00:01:23.780" style="s2">suggest watching one or more of the</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.520" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">a pretty good understanding I saw</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.470" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">another documentary recently called 97%</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.080" end="00:01:49.970" style="s2">well worth checking out and so yeah as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.710" end="00:01:51.950" style="s2">say I&#39;m not gonna go into all of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.970" end="00:01:54.470" style="s2">details what I&#39;m going to begin with is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.950" end="00:01:58.729" style="s2">an account of how commercial bank money</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.470" end="00:02:02.420" style="s2">is created because that is about 90%</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.729" end="00:02:05.050" style="s2">excuse me 97% of our money supply hence</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.420" end="00:02:10.390" style="s2">the title of that documentary 97% owned</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.050" end="00:02:14.710" style="s2">and I want to look at what the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.390" end="00:02:18.410" style="s2">consequences are of this debt based</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.810" end="00:02:40.070" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of emerged now into the sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.550" end="00:02:42.680" style="s2">of general public awareness that money</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.070" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">is created out of nothing and this is</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.380" end="00:02:56.650" style="s2">of it I&#39;m sorry if that sounds a little</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.650" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">for me if people really did understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:03.530" style="s2">it they&#39;d be a lot angry about it and</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">right at the heart of our monetary</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.819" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">system lies a very clever little piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:14.880" style="s2">of trickery where there is nothing there</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">is no money you go into a bank you fill</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.880" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">in a loan agreement or you borrow some</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">money on a credit card or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:22.620" style="s2">process is the same whoever the lender</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">is and you hand that over to the bank</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.620" end="00:04:28.770" style="s2">and they turn that loan agreement into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.360" style="s2">form of promissory note which will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:31.979" style="s2">accepted by other people so you had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.360" end="00:04:33.660" style="s2">promissory note over - over to the bank</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.979" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">in other words the loan agreement your</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.660" end="00:04:39.479" style="s2">promise to repay this loan and they type</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:41.370" style="s2">some numbers into a databank and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.479" end="00:04:43.260" style="s2">amount of money appears in your bank</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.370" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">account and because that&#39;s in your bank</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.260" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">account you can now spend there but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:48.900" style="s2">are io u--&#39;s you&#39;ve filled an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">to the bank and they have provided you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.900" end="00:04:53.220" style="s2">with those very same IOUs in a form</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:56.610" style="s2">which can now be exchanged for goods and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.220" end="00:04:58.979" style="s2">services on this diagram here time goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.610" end="00:05:00.900" style="s2">from left to right so on the left hand</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.979" end="00:05:02.910" style="s2">side there is no money there is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.900" end="00:05:04.440" style="s2">and then as you move along from left to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.910" end="00:05:06.030" style="s2">right you reach a point where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.440" end="00:05:07.770" style="s2">red line and a blue line which diverge</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.030" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">from each other at that point there at</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.770" end="00:05:11.880" style="s2">that point in time that is the moment of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:14.400" style="s2">which you have taken out your loan and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.880" end="00:05:16.500" style="s2">so two things are created at that point</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.400" end="00:05:18.450" style="s2">and they are opposites of each other so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.500" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">a debt is created you owe money to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.450" end="00:05:23.070" style="s2">bank and the bank creates a bank balance</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.330" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">in your favor which you can now go and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">spend what we call money now from that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:29.729" style="s2">moment on as you can see the red line</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">the blue line go the same distance away</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.729" end="00:05:33.539" style="s2">from the central point you move along</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.800" end="00:05:35.970" style="s2">further in time and then they come</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.539" end="00:05:37.660" style="s2">together again and at which point the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.970" end="00:05:39.850" style="s2">loan is paid off and the money</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.660" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">and the debt destroy one another so they</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.850" end="00:05:44.650" style="s2">came from nothing and then when the debt</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.310" end="00:05:47.530" style="s2">is paid off the money that pays off that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.650" end="00:05:51.580" style="s2">debt is destroyed there&#39;s one crucial</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.530" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2">thing wrong with this diagram when the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.580" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">loan is paid off the amount of money and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.920" end="00:05:58.200" style="s2">the amount of debt are exactly equal to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:00.460" style="s2">each other and so the money and the debt</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.200" end="00:06:03.550" style="s2">annihilate money to one another however</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.460" end="00:06:06.220" style="s2">in the real world of course debts come</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.550" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">with interest for example I&#39;ve just done</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.220" end="00:06:10.900" style="s2">a little calculation if you borrow</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">100,000 pounds over 25 years at an</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.900" end="00:06:17.710" style="s2">interest rate of 5% you end up paying</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.690" end="00:06:20.530" style="s2">back just shy of 175 thousand pounds now</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.710" end="00:06:23.620" style="s2">it&#39;s really crucial that you understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.530" end="00:06:25.450" style="s2">this point very few people do that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.620" end="00:06:27.310" style="s2">money that the bank gave you in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.450" end="00:06:28.360" style="s2">first place was yours it was always</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.310" end="00:06:30.100" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.360" end="00:06:31.660" style="s2">when you sign that loan agreement you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.100" end="00:06:34.480" style="s2">are giving a promissory note to the bank</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.660" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">and they are taking that promissory note</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.480" end="00:06:38.620" style="s2">and giving you a bunch of their own io</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:40.690" style="s2">u--&#39;s but their euro uses you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.620" end="00:06:41.920" style="s2">promising to pay that money back and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.690" end="00:06:44.200" style="s2">all they&#39;ve done is turn that promissory</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.920" end="00:06:46.870" style="s2">note into a bunch of numbers in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.200" end="00:06:49.570" style="s2">databank or if you&#39;re lucky you get some</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.870" end="00:06:51.040" style="s2">bits of paper in your hand and you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.570" end="00:06:52.480" style="s2">exchange those bits of pay for all those</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.040" end="00:06:54.520" style="s2">numbers in a databank for goods and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.480" end="00:06:57.220" style="s2">services but they are your IOUs</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.520" end="00:06:59.550" style="s2">it is your money it always was and yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.220" end="00:07:03.850" style="s2">somehow or other they feel justified in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.550" end="00:07:05.740" style="s2">charging you 75,000 pounds rent on those</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.850" end="00:07:09.910" style="s2">numbers in a databank over a period of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.740" end="00:07:11.830" style="s2">2500 over a period of 25 years the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.910" end="00:07:14.890" style="s2">important thing to be clear about is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.830" end="00:07:17.020" style="s2">that because the bank doesn&#39;t own the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.890" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">money that it&#39;s lending to people as</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.020" end="00:07:22.360" style="s2">property in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:26.380" style="s2">technically every single loan agreement</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.360" end="00:07:29.020" style="s2">is not a legal contract does not form a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.380" end="00:07:32.530" style="s2">legal contract because for a contract to</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:09.190" style="s2">think it was and the judge found exactly</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.190" end="00:08:22.780" style="s2">was allowed to keep his house now</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.660" end="00:08:26.169" style="s2">interestingly that Court decision was</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.760" end="00:08:46.839" style="s2">nevertheless the argument is valid the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.339" end="00:08:49.750" style="s2">banks do not own the money as property</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.839" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">and so technically every single loan</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.150" end="00:09:26.830" style="s2">around is this that going back to my</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.830" end="00:09:31.420" style="s2">thousand pound mortgage that I did</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.120" end="00:09:33.100" style="s2">before the only money which is created</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.420" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">by the bank is the hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">pounds which they lend me the seventy</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">five thousand pounds which I have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:43.180" style="s2">them in additional interest they do not</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:45.580" style="s2">create and so an eternal and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.180" end="00:09:48.190" style="s2">ever-growing shortfall in the money</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.580" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">supply is created by the application of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.190" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">interest the amounts of debt outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.930" end="00:09:55.410" style="s2">is always greater than the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:58.030" style="s2">money available in circulation to pay it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.410" end="00:10:01.330" style="s2">this creates scarcity in the money</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.030" end="00:10:02.690" style="s2">supply and this for me is the primary</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.330" end="00:10:07.340" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.690" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">we see greedy selfish ultimately rooted</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.340" end="00:10:11.150" style="s2">in fearful behavior because people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">worried they&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.150" end="00:10:14.150" style="s2">pull enough money out of the ever</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.150" end="00:10:20.180" style="s2">their payments on their lives be it debt</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.750" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">be it bills be it whatever and so like</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.180" end="00:10:24.050" style="s2">I&#39;ve said in previous videos this sets</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.590" style="s2">us in competition against each other</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.260" end="00:10:47.090" style="s2">and he explains very clearly exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.770" end="00:10:48.470" style="s2">the monetary system robs us I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.090" end="00:10:52.220" style="s2">going to play one little clip from it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.470" end="00:10:54.080" style="s2">just to show the idea visually of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.220" end="00:10:56.810" style="s2">unpayable debt building if there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.080" end="00:11:00.110" style="s2">interest due on every dollar in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.810" end="00:11:01.940" style="s2">existence let me ask you something if</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.110" end="00:11:03.710" style="s2">you borrow the very first dollar into</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.940" end="00:11:06.080" style="s2">existence and that&#39;s the only dollar</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.710" end="00:11:08.060" style="s2">that exists on the planet but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.080" end="00:11:10.580" style="s2">promised to pay it back plus another</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.060" end="00:11:11.900" style="s2">dollars worth of interest where do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.580" end="00:11:14.330" style="s2">get the second dollar to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.900" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">interest the answer is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.330" end="00:11:18.350" style="s2">borrow that one into existence and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:20.510" style="s2">promised to pay it back with interest as</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.350" end="00:11:23.660" style="s2">well so now there are two dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.510" end="00:11:26.390" style="s2">existence but you owe four and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.660" end="00:11:29.210" style="s2">so on the result is there&#39;s never enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.390" end="00:11:31.250" style="s2">currency to pay the debt there is always</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.210" end="00:11:34.210" style="s2">more debt in the system than there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.250" end="00:11:37.310" style="s2">currency in existence to pay the debt</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.210" end="00:11:40.130" style="s2">therefore the whole system is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.310" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">it is finite it will come to an end one</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.130" end="00:11:45.020" style="s2">day there is a payment due every month</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:47.060" style="s2">on the principal plus the interest on</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.020" end="00:11:50.089" style="s2">every dollar in existence and those</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.060" end="00:11:52.370" style="s2">payments do not stop if we stop</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.089" end="00:11:54.530" style="s2">borrowing then no new currency is</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.370" end="00:11:57.080" style="s2">created to replace the currency that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.530" end="00:11:58.610" style="s2">used to make those payments whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.080" end="00:12:00.680" style="s2">you&#39;re making a payment on a loan or</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:02.930" style="s2">paying tax to make a payment on a bond</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.680" end="00:12:05.660" style="s2">the portion of the payment that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.930" end="00:12:06.960" style="s2">pay off the principal extinguishes that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.660" end="00:12:09.270" style="s2">portion of the debt</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.960" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">but the debt also extinguishes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.270" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">currency currency and debt are like</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:16.860" style="s2">matter and antimatter when they meet</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:18.990" style="s2">they annihilate each other if we just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.860" end="00:12:21.270" style="s2">pay off the principal only on all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.990" end="00:12:24.120" style="s2">loans and bonds that exist the entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">currency supply just vanishes so if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.120" end="00:12:28.380" style="s2">don&#39;t go deeper into debt every year</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:30.510" style="s2">look what happens the whole thing goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.380" end="00:12:33.900" style="s2">into a deflationary collapse under the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.510" end="00:12:35.730" style="s2">weight of those payments politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.900" end="00:12:37.890" style="s2">pundits alike talk about balancing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.730" end="00:12:40.200" style="s2">budget paying down the debt and living</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.890" end="00:12:42.330" style="s2">within our means they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.200" end="00:12:44.430" style="s2">that that is deflationary it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.330" end="00:12:46.650" style="s2">impossible to do under our current</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.430" end="00:12:49.290" style="s2">monetary system without collapsing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.650" end="00:12:50.700" style="s2">whole economy in the u.s. right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.290" end="00:12:52.620" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about raising the debt</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.700" end="00:12:56.250" style="s2">ceiling again they do this every year</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.620" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">and it makes me laugh because increasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.250" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">debt as I think I&#39;ve shown pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">clearly is inevitable under this</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:03.810" style="s2">monetary system you know with interest</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:05.430" style="s2">being applied to the debt and not the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.810" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">money to pay the interest you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.430" end="00:13:10.530" style="s2">debt growing faster the money is is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:12.900" style="s2">absolutely inevitable and so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.530" end="00:13:15.840" style="s2">reduce debt you have to destroy money if</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.900" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">you destroy money you bring on recession</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.840" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">and deflation and so you know it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.450" end="00:13:23.280" style="s2">an impossibility for nations for</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:24.930" style="s2">individuals ultimately to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.280" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">debt leave at some point this is going</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.930" end="00:13:28.740" style="s2">to lead to complete collapse of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:53.540" style="s2">for me it&#39;s a kind of slavery because</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.110" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">they are lending you this fictitious</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.540" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">money and then they are expecting you to</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.460" end="00:16:11.940" style="s2">is right there&#39;s absolutely tons and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.470" end="00:16:14.130" style="s2">tons and tons about this on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.940" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">and as far as I can tell little or</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.130" end="00:16:20.970" style="s2">nothing in the way of anyone saying that</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">this is not how it is remember we are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.970" end="00:16:25.980" style="s2">the matrix right and money owns media</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">money owns government and these</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.010" end="00:16:39.090" style="s2">said it would be the truth and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.960" end="00:16:40.530" style="s2">only level one in level two we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.090" end="00:16:43.410" style="s2">to look at how the money supply is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.530" end="00:16:46.350" style="s2">expanded and how that expanded money</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.410" end="00:16:48.540" style="s2">supply is then in turn used to enslave</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.350" end="00:16:51.060" style="s2">not just people but nations and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.540" end="00:17:10.260" style="s2">governments and ultimately the whole</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.060" end="00:17:11.580" style="s2">world in unpayable debt okay so when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:14.670" style="s2">go into the bank when you borrow money</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.580" end="00:17:16.500" style="s2">that debt that you incur with the bank</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.670" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">now believe it or not becomes an asset</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.500" end="00:17:19.680" style="s2">of the bay because you have promised to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:22.680" style="s2">pay them this Bank this becomes an asset</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.680" end="00:17:24.600" style="s2">of the bank and they can buy and sell</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.680" end="00:17:26.880" style="s2">this asset this is what securities are</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.600" end="00:17:29.700" style="s2">mortgage-backed securities are mortgages</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.880" end="00:17:31.020" style="s2">which there is a promise to repay and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.700" end="00:17:33.270" style="s2">that hundred thousand pound mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.020" end="00:17:34.770" style="s2">that we were looking at before is worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.270" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">in the long term one hundred seventy</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.770" end="00:17:37.860" style="s2">five thousand pounds but banks may</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">choose to sell that right now for say</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.860" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">130 bank or thirty thousand pounds</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">profit and then pass on the liability</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:47.400" style="s2">and the collection of the monthly</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:49.350" style="s2">payments to a buyer now the importance</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.400" end="00:17:52.380" style="s2">of these securities I&#39;ll talk about in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.350" end="00:17:54.630" style="s2">future video and I look at crashes but</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.380" end="00:17:57.480" style="s2">for right now let&#39;s look at how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.630" end="00:17:59.940" style="s2">money supply is expanded so you walk</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.480" end="00:18:01.070" style="s2">into the bank and you borrow a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.940" end="00:18:03.470" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.070" end="00:18:06.259" style="s2">that thousand dollars to buy say a sofa</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.470" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">off of ebay the person you buy that so</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.259" end="00:18:09.889" style="s2">for from then deposits that thousand</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:12.889" style="s2">dollars into their bank account this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.889" end="00:18:14.299" style="s2">where this diagram begins so right at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.889" end="00:18:15.830" style="s2">the top left hand corner person goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.299" end="00:18:18.139" style="s2">into the bank deposits their thousand</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.830" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">dollars the bank is required to keep a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.139" end="00:18:22.250" style="s2">reserve for this example it&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">percent it&#39;s not always ten percent it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.250" end="00:18:25.070" style="s2">can be lower than that and I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.649" style="s2">about the implications of that in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.070" end="00:18:29.059" style="s2">minute so that thousand pounds that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.649" end="00:18:31.549" style="s2">have deposited with and they&#39;re required</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.059" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">to keep a $100 deposit sorry I said</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.549" end="00:18:34.399" style="s2">pounds I meant dollars they could</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:35.929" style="s2">require to keep a $100 deposit and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.399" end="00:18:37.070" style="s2">can lend out another nine hundred but</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.929" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t lend out the other nine</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.070" end="00:18:41.029" style="s2">hundred dollars that was given to them</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">in the thousand dollars that still</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.029" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">belongs to the person that deposited it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:46.970" style="s2">what they do is they create nine hundred</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:49.250" style="s2">dollars of new IOUs and they lend it out</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.970" end="00:18:50.600" style="s2">to somebody else so that&#39;s the person on</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.250" end="00:18:52.399" style="s2">the right hand side there they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.600" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">and borrowed nine hundred dollars we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.399" end="00:18:55.159" style="s2">then go down to the second line they</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:58.330" style="s2">deposit that nine hundred dollars into</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.159" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">their bank or they spend it and the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.330" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">somebody else deposits into their bank</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:03.740" style="s2">once again the bank is required to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:05.809" style="s2">a ninety dollar reserve and can create</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.740" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">another eight hundred and ten dollars so</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.809" end="00:19:09.830" style="s2">at the end of step one they&#39;ve the banks</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.149" style="s2">created a new nine hundred dollars so</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.830" end="00:19:12.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a thousand dollars we started</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.149" end="00:19:14.120" style="s2">with plus another 900 days created</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.919" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">there&#39;s now nineteen hundred dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.120" end="00:19:17.750" style="s2">the system but the bank only has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:19.129" style="s2">hundred dollars of reserves at the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.750" end="00:19:21.559" style="s2">of step two</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.129" end="00:19:23.240" style="s2">once the reposes is repeated again there</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.559" end="00:19:24.470" style="s2">is now two thousand seven hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.240" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">nineteen hundred dollars from before</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.470" end="00:19:27.529" style="s2">plus a new one hundred and ten so two</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">thousand seven hundred and ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.529" end="00:19:31.399" style="s2">and the bank has held an additional nice</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">dollars of reserves and so the banks now</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.399" end="00:19:34.669" style="s2">have one hundred and ninety dollars of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">reserves and so on and so on and so on</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.669" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">this diagram here goes up to step three</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:40.879" style="s2">in theory with a ten percent reserve I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.210" style="s2">mean in theory it can go on forever but</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.879" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">in practice with the ten percent reserve</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:48.169" style="s2">usually is about a tenfold increase in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:50.059" style="s2">the money supply so one thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.169" end="00:19:54.139" style="s2">will eventually become ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.059" end="00:19:55.639" style="s2">dollars ten percent is a pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.139" end="00:19:57.889" style="s2">reserve requirement actually reserve</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.639" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">requirements can be as low as two three</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.889" end="00:20:02.389" style="s2">percent sometimes even nothing at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:04.039" style="s2">with a three percent reserve requirement</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.389" end="00:20:05.899" style="s2">a one thousand dollar initial deposit</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.039" end="00:20:08.360" style="s2">could become as much as thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.899" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">dollars by the end of it and remember</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.360" end="00:20:11.929" style="s2">they&#39;re creating all of this stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">of thin air at no cost to themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.929" end="00:20:14.500" style="s2">lending it all</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:17.470" style="s2">to the interests so profiting from it</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.500" end="00:20:19.390" style="s2">and so they are strongly incentivized to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.470" end="00:20:21.850" style="s2">create and lend out as much money as</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.390" end="00:20:24.580" style="s2">possible and you know with this system</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.850" end="00:20:26.200" style="s2">banks can between the by lending money</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.580" end="00:20:27.910" style="s2">to each other and passing around in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.200" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">circle the loan that one to another</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.910" end="00:20:32.020" style="s2">becomes the reserves of the next one who</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">can then lend out more and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.020" end="00:20:36.610" style="s2">on and so on so essentially banks can</p>
