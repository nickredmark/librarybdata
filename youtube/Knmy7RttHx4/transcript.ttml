<p begin="00:00:02.520" end="00:00:06.839" style="s2">the dark horse podcast I&#39;m your host</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.710" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">Brett Weinstein and with me today via</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">remote link is my good friend Douglas</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">Murray welcome Douglas great to be with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:16.020" style="s2">you Bret well I&#39;m really glad you agreed</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:17.730" style="s2">to join me for this and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">looking forward to the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.730" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">should confess upfront that I have not</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">read your book but let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">something I did something better I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:33.800" style="s2">you read your book to me now in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2">case the audiobook is read by you and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.800" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">while that&#39;s a lovely option in many</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.059" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">cases your voice is so resonant and your</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">choice of wording and diction is so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">precise and careful that having you read</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">it is even more delightful than reading</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">it on the page so for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">enjoy that sort of thing I would highly</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">recommend the audio version of this book</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">which Douglass reads and I would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">at least go through a few chapters at</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">regular speed so you can hear just how</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">carefully put together this lovely book</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:13.549" style="s2">is I also want to say a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">about this book and maybe set the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.549" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">discussion in a particular direction in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">some ways I didn&#39;t need this book</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">because my life its trajectory has put</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:29.159" style="s2">me in a circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:30.900" style="s2">I&#39;m obviously thoroughly steeped in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.159" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">various contradictions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.900" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">intersectionality and the result of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">happens when they&#39;re deployed into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">world however I do think that your book</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">is potentially revolutionary from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">point of view of steering our way out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:53.700" style="s2">the mess that we find ourselves in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">was really so brilliantly argued and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.700" end="00:02:00.509" style="s2">thorough and so careful I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">really bend over backwards to look into</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.509" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">these matters and let them indict</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">themselves rather than caricaturing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">arguments on the other side for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:10.600" style="s2">so thank you for writing and for one</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.600" end="00:02:15.910" style="s2">and it has my strongest recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">for people to pick it up whatever sides</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.910" end="00:02:22.360" style="s2">of these issues they find themselves on</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:23.530" style="s2">it is it is well worth us engaging well</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.360" end="00:02:26.410" style="s2">thank you very much for that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.530" end="00:02:28.300" style="s2">delighted you say that and delighted</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.410" end="00:02:30.340" style="s2">that the audio book comes across well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.300" end="00:02:31.900" style="s2">did it myself but you won&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.340" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">to learn I haven&#39;t actually listened to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.900" end="00:02:37.960" style="s2">it myself no that does not surprise me</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">at all as you as you&#39;ve guessed but yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.960" end="00:02:42.880" style="s2">it does come across wonderfully I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.040" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">know if other people have this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.880" end="00:02:48.730" style="s2">experience but I find that if I know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:50.920" style="s2">somebody&#39;s voice well then if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.730" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">reading I actually hear their voice so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.920" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">in some sense this was a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:57.970" style="s2">the experience of of reading it but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">was just easier you know I could turn it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.970" end="00:03:03.730" style="s2">on and relax but you yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:05.530" style="s2">it&#39;s been four days in a studio in South</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.730" end="00:03:07.390" style="s2">London locked up to do it but I&#39;d she</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.530" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">had I had a whale of a time doing it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.390" end="00:03:12.190" style="s2">funnily enough and I&#39;m just delighted</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:14.530" style="s2">that readers have been enjoying it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.190" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">listeners have been enjoying it but and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.530" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">I have to say a number of times in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:21.190" style="s2">recording process I did what we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.290" style="s2">corpse as an Americanism when you corpse</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.190" end="00:03:26.560" style="s2">on stage it&#39;s when you just can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.290" end="00:03:29.140" style="s2">laughing and the performance has to stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.560" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">and I corpse several times whilst doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.140" end="00:03:33.310" style="s2">the audio version of this book and I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:36.850" style="s2">to explain to the sound engineer I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.310" end="00:03:39.550" style="s2">laughing at my own jokes I&#39;m laughing at</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.850" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">the unbelievable ridiculousness of some</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.550" end="00:03:43.240" style="s2">of the things I&#39;m having to read out</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.780" end="00:03:47.950" style="s2">here yes that&#39;s one of the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.240" end="00:03:51.700" style="s2">delights in the book is that you read</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:56.470" style="s2">other people&#39;s words as they present</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.700" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">their own argument and the glaring</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.470" end="00:04:02.590" style="s2">contradictions and the total lack of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:07.030" style="s2">self-awareness for some of these people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.590" end="00:04:08.830" style="s2">is just utterly evident yes yes you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.030" end="00:04:10.450" style="s2">have to sort of show it you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.830" end="00:04:13.270" style="s2">don&#39;t have to tell particularly with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.450" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">do you yes and I and I love the approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.270" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy because the argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:22.600" style="s2">against the intersectional portrayal of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:24.730" style="s2">the world and the plan is so absurd</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.600" end="00:04:28.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a temptation</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.730" end="00:04:30.790" style="s2">to really you know really bring the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.210" end="00:04:32.470" style="s2">point home and you can oversell it very</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.790" end="00:04:35.290" style="s2">easily but you&#39;ve gone the other</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.470" end="00:04:36.760" style="s2">direction by very carefully stating the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.290" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">case letting them present it in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.760" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">own words and then interpreting what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:49.210" style="s2">meaning must be it&#39;s very effective at</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:51.130" style="s2">well a number of of jobs so I said</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">something about trying to set the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.130" end="00:04:56.710" style="s2">interview in motion you&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.060" style="s2">podcasts and other interviews of late</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.710" end="00:05:00.190" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to duplicate them I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.060" end="00:05:01.330" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need to but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.190" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">think there&#39;s something else that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.330" end="00:05:09.070" style="s2">do here so interesting in the book you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:12.730" style="s2">use a particular analogy in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.070" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">places and it&#39;s one that I was surprised</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.730" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">and delighted to find you using because</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:23.320" style="s2">I use the exact analogy and in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:25.270" style="s2">I reference the same weapon system with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.320" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">respect to the position I&#39;ve been in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.270" end="00:05:32.200" style="s2">the the analogy has to do with mine</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">clearing mine as in military mines and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.200" end="00:05:38.290" style="s2">there is this weapon system which</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">effectively a tank launches a missile</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.290" end="00:05:43.660" style="s2">that drags a cable behind it over a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">minefield the cable hits the ground</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.660" end="00:05:47.950" style="s2">explodes and detonates all the mines</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:52.480" style="s2">adjacent to it creating a path through</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.950" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">the minefield right so some of us for</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.480" end="00:06:00.220" style="s2">whatever reason have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:06:03.820" style="s2">endure certain challenges that come back</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.220" end="00:06:08.140" style="s2">when we engage certain topics talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.820" end="00:06:12.790" style="s2">about trans rights for example or race</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.140" end="00:06:15.490" style="s2">has been fatal to careers and it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.790" end="00:06:17.500" style="s2">caused people to retreat into private</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.490" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">life and things like that but some of us</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.500" end="00:06:21.730" style="s2">are able to explode these mines and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">hope you know the reason to use in mines</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.730" end="00:06:27.610" style="s2">as an analogy is that once exploded it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:29.970" style="s2">creates the opportunity for others to to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.610" end="00:06:32.680" style="s2">come through so I sort of see us as</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.970" end="00:06:34.810" style="s2">strangely in the same business and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.680" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">business is exploding mines that have</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.810" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">been placed there to manipulate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:43.240" style="s2">Corral</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:46.090" style="s2">so that others can more boldly explore</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.240" end="00:06:50.190" style="s2">the landscaping so anyway what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.090" end="00:06:53.349" style="s2">hoping is that in this discussion we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.190" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">utilize that instinct towards mind</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.349" end="00:06:59.830" style="s2">clearing to explore some of this space</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:02.199" style="s2">in a way that might be productive I like</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.830" end="00:07:05.500" style="s2">the sound of it already right awesome</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.199" end="00:07:08.380" style="s2">all right so by the way awesome is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.500" end="00:07:09.629" style="s2">American expression meaning quite good</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.380" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.629" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">right right sorry I I will I will</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:21.430" style="s2">Americanism could be worse could be</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.530" end="00:07:25.539" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.430" end="00:07:27.569" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s see where where to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.539" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">begin</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.569" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">there is something curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:41.050" style="s2">portrayal of you in the media and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:45.340" style="s2">the actual experience of you as a person</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.050" end="00:07:48.580" style="s2">in informal context and the experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.340" end="00:07:52.719" style="s2">of reading your writing mm-hmm do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.580" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">consider yourself a conservative yes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.719" end="00:07:55.990" style="s2">lots of ways I&#39;m not that wild about</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:59.050" style="s2">political labels and the older I get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.990" end="00:08:01.990" style="s2">less wild I am about them my experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.050" end="00:08:04.180" style="s2">is that when you&#39;re young or younger you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.990" end="00:08:05.949" style="s2">need labels because you need to orient</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.180" end="00:08:07.750" style="s2">yourself in the world and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.949" end="00:08:10.659" style="s2">try to orient the world towards yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.750" end="00:08:13.379" style="s2">and how you should view it and it should</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.659" end="00:08:15.310" style="s2">view you and that the older you get and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.379" end="00:08:16.750" style="s2">generally I think that becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.310" end="00:08:18.669" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.750" end="00:08:20.050" style="s2">yes I mean there&#39;s lots of things about</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.669" end="00:08:22.779" style="s2">me that I would regard as being</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.050" end="00:08:24.250" style="s2">conservative probably broadly speaking I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.779" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">prefer things that are good to remain</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.250" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">the same than to change I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:33.820" style="s2">change for changes sake but I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.349" style="s2">that and also these things change across</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:38.649" style="s2">borders don&#39;t they I mean lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.349" end="00:08:41.409" style="s2">about my type of politics such as they</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.649" end="00:08:45.880" style="s2">are wouldn&#39;t be conservative especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.409" end="00:08:49.060" style="s2">in an American context for instance so</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.880" end="00:08:51.970" style="s2">so all of these all these terms become</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.060" end="00:08:53.800" style="s2">slightly difficult to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.970" end="00:08:56.189" style="s2">yes I mean I&#39;d certainly sound more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.800" end="00:08:59.110" style="s2">conservative than I am a leftist yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.189" end="00:09:01.300" style="s2">interesting so the description that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.110" end="00:09:03.939" style="s2">give of a conservative somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.300" end="00:09:06.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like change for changes sake and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.939" end="00:09:07.990" style="s2">you want things that work to stay the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.069" end="00:09:10.360" style="s2">same that sounds to me a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.990" end="00:09:13.060" style="s2">being an adult not being a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.360" end="00:09:15.610" style="s2">well but to maybe the same thing well</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.060" end="00:09:17.500" style="s2">here&#39;s the question though and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.610" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">this is why I raised the topic is I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:23.829" style="s2">would describe myself as a radical and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.870" style="s2">would also if I go further would say I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.829" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">am a reluctant radical because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.870" end="00:09:32.889" style="s2">terrified of change the only reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:35.889" style="s2">a radical is because I believe radical</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.889" end="00:09:38.949" style="s2">change is required by our circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.889" end="00:09:42.750" style="s2">but I am frightened by the tendency on</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.949" end="00:09:46.509" style="s2">the left to see only the upside of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.750" end="00:09:51.009" style="s2">proposals and to get caught off guard by</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.509" end="00:09:54.519" style="s2">the unintended consequences yeah so and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.009" end="00:09:56.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve also said that I am a radical who</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.519" end="00:10:01.269" style="s2">hopes to live in a world so good that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.980" end="00:10:02.709" style="s2">get to be a conservative now my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.269" end="00:10:07.149" style="s2">you can translate all these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.709" end="00:10:10.629" style="s2">they&#39;re all effectively rephrasing zuv</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.149" end="00:10:12.639" style="s2">at the same point and just as I can say</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.629" end="00:10:14.980" style="s2">well I want I want to be a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.639" end="00:10:18.850" style="s2">but the world has to be in a position</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.980" end="00:10:21.339" style="s2">that change would be a bad idea before</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:25.809" style="s2">that makes sense in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.339" end="00:10:28.689" style="s2">that hints at the the adult portrayal of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.809" end="00:10:30.670" style="s2">conservatism that you paint when I read</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.689" end="00:10:36.430" style="s2">your book or when I have you read your</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.670" end="00:10:38.639" style="s2">book to me what I detect is the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.430" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">a liberal ah</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.639" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">yes I think it&#39;s very clearly there the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:46.779" style="s2">main conservative newspaper here The</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:50.050" style="s2">Telegraph in reviewing the madness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.779" end="00:10:52.029" style="s2">crowds said you know actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.050" end="00:10:53.649" style="s2">perfectly plain from this book that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.029" end="00:10:55.870" style="s2">Douglas Meier is an old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.649" end="00:10:57.879" style="s2">liberal at heart well but I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.870" end="00:11:00.429" style="s2">want to say old-fashioned because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.879" end="00:11:04.870" style="s2">know the classical liberal label has</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.429" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">become a bit of a shield for you but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.870" end="00:11:12.790" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">a bold a liberal vision right not just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.790" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">desire for tolerance but you embrace in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">this book and in fact you make a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:28.170" style="s2">powerful argument for you know for love</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:30.699" style="s2">you mentioned it several times</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.170" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">explicitly in terms of how we should be</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.699" end="00:11:35.529" style="s2">dealing with each other and not only do</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:41.769" style="s2">I resonate with the portrayal but I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.529" end="00:11:45.820" style="s2">find it very much outside of what most</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.769" end="00:11:47.620" style="s2">people would view as conservative so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.820" end="00:11:52.029" style="s2">see you trying to conserve structures</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.620" end="00:11:55.810" style="s2">that work but I see you embracing a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.029" end="00:11:59.320" style="s2">vision and in fact much of your defense</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.810" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">is predicated on the fact that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.320" end="00:12:04.660" style="s2">that things are great but that we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.510" end="00:12:06.899" style="s2">getting better we have been getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.660" end="00:12:09.610" style="s2">better at them and that that trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.899" end="00:12:12.790" style="s2">you&#39;d be foolish to upend it willy-nilly</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.610" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">yes I think I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.790" end="00:12:18.730" style="s2">summary of what I think is that on all</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">of the rights issues I&#39;m describing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.730" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s unarguable that they&#39;ve got better</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">it&#39;s arguable as well that that at some</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:28.329" style="s2">stage each of them for most of along the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">way quite quite a while have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.329" end="00:12:31.480" style="s2">opposed by people who didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:34.890" style="s2">anything much to change so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.480" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">obviously an inherent question there</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.890" end="00:12:41.470" style="s2">which is always a question about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:43.990" style="s2">the battle that goes on between you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.470" end="00:12:46.300" style="s2">progressivism and conservatism which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.990" end="00:12:47.890" style="s2">that broadly speaking conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.300" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">fight the next battle they&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.890" end="00:12:54.069" style="s2">lose and and then then move on and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:55.269" style="s2">change the ground accordingly and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.069" end="00:12:57.339" style="s2">indeed the progressives change the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.269" end="00:13:00.339" style="s2">ground according in and actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.339" end="00:13:03.399" style="s2">the only ways I think I understand why</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.339" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">our societies tend to be almost 50/50</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.399" end="00:13:07.019" style="s2">torn between these two instincts is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:09.399" style="s2">because it is exactly the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.019" end="00:13:11.019" style="s2">question to work out when it when is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.399" end="00:13:13.209" style="s2">a good time to fundamentally alter an</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.019" end="00:13:15.640" style="s2">institution and when when is staying</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.209" end="00:13:17.860" style="s2">with what you have a better choice or</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.640" end="00:13:19.810" style="s2">when can a very soft form of that change</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.860" end="00:13:22.610" style="s2">be allowed to occur</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.810" end="00:13:26.630" style="s2">yes I mean I don&#39;t believe in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.610" end="00:13:29.990" style="s2">progress as a teeny illogical force or</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.630" end="00:13:32.330" style="s2">anything like that but obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.990" end="00:13:34.430" style="s2">demonstra Belov things get better for</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.330" end="00:13:35.960" style="s2">certain groups at certain times certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.430" end="00:13:37.550" style="s2">people at certain time but of course the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.960" end="00:13:40.250" style="s2">corollary of that is that they also can</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.550" end="00:13:42.410" style="s2">get worse which is the bit I think in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.250" end="00:13:43.940" style="s2">the progressive vision which which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.410" end="00:13:45.650" style="s2">always missing is that the assumption is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.940" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">that if if you get through certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.650" end="00:13:49.580" style="s2">barriers it&#39;s inevitably going to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:51.200" style="s2">better whereas whereas many things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.580" end="00:13:54.830" style="s2">I think progressives and others see as</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.200" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">being forces that are holding people</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.830" end="00:14:03.020" style="s2">back are doing that and they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2">for a good reason so I find this so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.020" end="00:14:10.250" style="s2">interesting I agree with what you said</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:13.670" style="s2">about the decreasing utility of labels</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.250" end="00:14:15.140" style="s2">as you grow up effectively and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.670" end="00:14:17.450" style="s2">the reason for it is fairly obvious</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.140" end="00:14:19.370" style="s2">which is that as a young person you may</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.450" end="00:14:22.520" style="s2">very well sign up for a slate of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.370" end="00:14:24.740" style="s2">and so that label correctly points to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.520" end="00:14:27.560" style="s2">bunch of positions you will likely hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.740" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">as you grow more nuanced your tendency</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.560" end="00:14:33.200" style="s2">to depart from parts of a slate even if</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:37.130" style="s2">you embrace other parts goes up and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.200" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">the label is let it&#39;s more noisy with</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.130" end="00:14:39.710" style="s2">respect to what you actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:43.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.710" end="00:14:45.980" style="s2">but when I I mean the nice thing about a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.640" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">book like the one you&#39;ve written here</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.980" end="00:14:53.930" style="s2">and your last one is that it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:57.200" style="s2">allows a person to Tromp around in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.930" end="00:14:59.240" style="s2">mind right to get to see how your your</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.200" end="00:15:02.390" style="s2">mental process works you you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.240" end="00:15:05.480" style="s2">provide a window into various quadrants</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.390" end="00:15:09.650" style="s2">of your thinking and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.480" end="00:15:12.110" style="s2">pretty interesting tour what I find so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.650" end="00:15:14.840" style="s2">fascinating is that you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.110" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">supposed to be miles apart I&#39;m a radical</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.840" end="00:15:20.900" style="s2">and you&#39;re more conservative than you</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:23.990" style="s2">are progressive yeah I find we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.900" end="00:15:27.230" style="s2">on very little in this exploration now</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.990" end="00:15:28.700" style="s2">why would that be well you do with us or</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.230" end="00:15:30.530" style="s2">something to do with everyone else so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.700" end="00:15:31.850" style="s2">should get to the root of that let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.530" end="00:15:32.790" style="s2">to the root of that and let&#39;s blow up</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.850" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">some mines along the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.790" end="00:15:39.450" style="s2">if we can I think one of the reasons is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:43.350" style="s2">because what we actually differ on has</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.450" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">almost nothing to do with values I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.350" end="00:15:49.260" style="s2">say in terms of what a desirable world</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:53.730" style="s2">would accomplish right I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.260" end="00:16:00.810" style="s2">agree to a great degree where we differ</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.730" end="00:16:02.550" style="s2">is on questions of how to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.810" end="00:16:06.600" style="s2">better place with respect to those</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.550" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">values we might differ on where we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.600" end="00:16:12.740" style="s2">currently although I suspect we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:17.870" style="s2">differ all that much on that question</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.740" end="00:16:25.410" style="s2">and we may differ on our sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.870" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">the particular hazards of change but in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.410" end="00:16:30.300" style="s2">a sense I think it&#39;s both something to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:32.520" style="s2">do with you and me and to do with other</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.300" end="00:16:36.110" style="s2">people and the you and me part would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.520" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">to the extent that you are serious about</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.110" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">understanding these issues rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:43.080" style="s2">posturing and in an attempt to bring</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:49.350" style="s2">about something that you want you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.080" end="00:16:51.870" style="s2">discover a a world of nuance and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.350" end="00:16:53.940" style="s2">will recognize it&#39;s a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.870" end="00:16:57.420" style="s2">you&#39;ll have self skepticism you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.940" end="00:16:59.760" style="s2">with the particular toolkit one ends up</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.420" end="00:17:02.070" style="s2">able to have this conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.760" end="00:17:04.920" style="s2">the deal-breaker is if the values don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.070" end="00:17:07.020" style="s2">align but once they do the rest is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.920" end="00:17:09.450" style="s2">question of where are we and where might</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.020" end="00:17:13.470" style="s2">we go and how good an idea is well if I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.450" end="00:17:15.650" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s that but it&#39;s also and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.470" end="00:17:18.540" style="s2">think we&#39;ve talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.650" end="00:17:19.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve met is that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.540" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">seems to me to be holding back all</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.710" end="00:17:25.320" style="s2">public conversation and an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:28.340" style="s2">private conversation now is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.320" end="00:17:30.570" style="s2">level of distrust which which may not be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.340" end="00:17:33.570" style="s2">unjustified on occasion but the level of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.570" end="00:17:36.420" style="s2">distrust that you can allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.570" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">go through a set of ideas with a person</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.420" end="00:17:40.800" style="s2">of different political views because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:43.770" style="s2">fear is that that person when you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.800" end="00:17:46.140" style="s2">the edge of your own competency is going</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.770" end="00:17:46.620" style="s2">to do something nasty on you you know so</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.140" end="00:17:48.360" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">case we might discuss something which</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.360" end="00:17:52.920" style="s2">you are far more knowledgeable about</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.590" style="s2">than me I we can we could find an awful</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.920" end="00:17:59.520" style="s2">lot of cases where that can occur and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.590" end="00:18:01.140" style="s2">vice versa but anyhow but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.520" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">is that is that we could get on to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.140" end="00:18:05.730" style="s2">whole set of things which you know more</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:07.320" style="s2">about than me and if if I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.730" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">when I&#39;m not looking you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.320" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">smuggle some communism into me and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:17.070" style="s2">know or vice versa when we&#39;re on some</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:19.260" style="s2">competency of mine and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.070" end="00:18:21.510" style="s2">looking I suddenly like make you do</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.260" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">Hitler salutes and things and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.510" end="00:18:26.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not it&#39;s not possible to have any</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:28.920" style="s2">of this and and one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.220" end="00:18:32.570" style="s2">all the trips the traps rather are laid</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.920" end="00:18:34.770" style="s2">at the moment is that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.570" end="00:18:37.110" style="s2">there does seem to be in society a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.770" end="00:18:38.520" style="s2">genuine relief that when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.110" end="00:18:42.870" style="s2">looking the other side are going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.520" end="00:18:45.450" style="s2">out to be Nazis or communists and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.870" end="00:18:47.550" style="s2">can have almost no discussion in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.450" end="00:18:50.600" style="s2">situation because nobody wants either of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.550" end="00:18:55.080" style="s2">those things and and so nothing happens</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.600" end="00:18:56.550" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly confident that if we get on</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.080" end="00:18:59.429" style="s2">to a particular issue of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.550" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">biology that you can trounce me on that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.429" end="00:19:04.110" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not doing it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:06.360" style="s2">you know reopen a gulag and send me into</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.110" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">it I&#39;m confident of that so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.360" end="00:19:13.170" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t mind the discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">but that&#39;s that that&#39;s the great problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.170" end="00:19:16.290" style="s2">at the moment and I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:18.179" style="s2">of it is sincere and how much of it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.290" end="00:19:22.050" style="s2">opportunistic and how much of it is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.179" end="00:19:26.610" style="s2">deluded but it is that it is that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.050" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">fear of what happens in the gaps I I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:33.510" style="s2">totally agree I have said elsewhere one</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:37.020" style="s2">of the places Erik quotes me sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.510" end="00:19:39.300" style="s2">is bad faith changes everything and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.020" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">the extent that you detect bad faith or</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.300" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">even fear bad faith the whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:49.860" style="s2">moves that are necessary for nuance are</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">off the table but one of the fears oh go</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.860" end="00:19:53.910" style="s2">ahead no I mean I just noticed this in I</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.470" style="s2">noticed it in television studios all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.910" end="00:19:58.500" style="s2">time I have certain radius to use in</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.470" end="00:20:00.450" style="s2">public discussions that that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.500" end="00:20:02.970" style="s2">going on is this horrible</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.450" end="00:20:04.920" style="s2">and and and and and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.970" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">reasons why we plainly strange language</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.920" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">games at the moment you know where</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:10.710" style="s2">people want to read into what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.780" style="s2">meaning of words is other than their</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.710" end="00:20:15.000" style="s2">overt meaning you know that the search</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.780" end="00:20:17.340" style="s2">for dog whistles and the identification</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.000" end="00:20:20.910" style="s2">of special sounds in the stratosphere</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.340" end="00:20:22.560" style="s2">you know all of this and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.910" end="00:20:25.560" style="s2">everywhere that&#39;s our public discussion</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.560" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">so I was going to say my fear in reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.560" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">your book something that just lurked for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:36.900" style="s2">me every chapter really was that I had</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">the sense that the argument was so well</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.900" end="00:20:43.230" style="s2">presented and so thorough you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:45.660" style="s2">really a very up-to-date exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.230" end="00:20:47.310" style="s2">this entire landscape and done by</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.660" end="00:20:49.860" style="s2">somebody I mean you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.310" end="00:20:51.750" style="s2">written as a PhD dissertation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.860" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">written in a very accessible form but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.750" end="00:20:59.580" style="s2">has the kind of encyclopedic thorough</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">nature of a PhD dissertation and my</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.580" end="00:21:04.830" style="s2">concern is that there is one move to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:08.100" style="s2">disarm it okay go on</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.830" end="00:21:09.650" style="s2">well it&#39;s unfortunately an uninteresting</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.100" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">move but it will be deployed</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.650" end="00:21:16.310" style="s2">automatically which is that this book is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:18.810" style="s2">so preposterous that no person who</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.310" end="00:21:22.740" style="s2">understands the arguments on the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.810" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">side would dare engage right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.740" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">point that many arguments many strategic</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">arguments in the modern landscape come</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:32.760" style="s2">down to this which is that which you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">cannot actually defeat on its merits you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.760" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">have to defeat by driving up the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:41.940" style="s2">engaging it right so driving up the cost</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:43.830" style="s2">of engaging with Douglas Murray is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.940" end="00:21:46.350" style="s2">go-to move because Douglas Murray</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.830" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">presents a very compelling case even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.350" end="00:21:52.350" style="s2">you have a radical view of what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">happen on earth you can still hear this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.350" end="00:21:55.800" style="s2">book loud and clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.580" end="00:21:58.260" style="s2">right I mean I don&#39;t know that somebody</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.010" end="00:22:07.260" style="s2">sort of aware of the argument that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:08.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in that they would detect that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.260" end="00:22:10.200" style="s2">you&#39;re a conservative at all from what</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.910" end="00:22:12.540" style="s2">you say here yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.200" end="00:22:14.279" style="s2">possible so I I hope that doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.540" end="00:22:16.499" style="s2">and I I guess I would say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.279" end="00:22:19.559" style="s2">maybe we have to invent a countermove</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.499" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">you know an honorable one but I dare you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.559" end="00:22:23.759" style="s2">to read this book if you if you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:26.219" style="s2">that this is a simple question I dare</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.759" end="00:22:27.210" style="s2">you to read Douglass&#39;s book yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.219" end="00:22:30.119" style="s2">I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.210" end="00:22:32.369" style="s2">there has been some engagement there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.119" end="00:22:35.369" style="s2">been less than uncie ation so far</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.369" end="00:22:37.529" style="s2">famous last words of course but less</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.369" end="00:22:39.210" style="s2">denunciation than I was fearing but then</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.529" end="00:22:41.849" style="s2">that was the case my last book too so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.210" end="00:22:43.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know I mean one possibility is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.849" end="00:22:49.169" style="s2">that the people who ought to read it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.710" end="00:22:51.299" style="s2">don&#39;t I was in a radio studio in London</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.169" end="00:22:53.369" style="s2">the other day with a writer for the main</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.299" end="00:22:55.139" style="s2">left-wing paper here who we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.369" end="00:22:57.719" style="s2">discussing her latest book and my latest</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.139" end="00:22:59.099" style="s2">book and it became clear before he went</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.719" end="00:23:01.289" style="s2">on air that she hadn&#39;t actually read my</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.099" end="00:23:02.700" style="s2">latest book and at the end of about an</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.289" end="00:23:04.169" style="s2">hour together on the radio our</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.700" end="00:23:06.330" style="s2">interviewer asked if we&#39;d learnt</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.169" end="00:23:08.219" style="s2">anything more about each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:09.749" style="s2">time we spent together and she said no</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.219" end="00:23:14.009" style="s2">because I&#39;ve read Douglas and I know</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.749" end="00:23:15.809" style="s2">what he thinks you actually told me you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.009" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">hadn&#39;t read this book and I know for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.809" end="00:23:21.149" style="s2">fact that you have not read any of my</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:22.710" style="s2">books before this one so but I just love</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.149" end="00:23:25.139" style="s2">that again no he can&#39;t tell me anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.710" end="00:23:27.690" style="s2">that&#39;s new cos I&#39;ve not read his stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.139" end="00:23:30.029" style="s2">know what he thinks right I know that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.690" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">that is that is the exact object in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.029" end="00:23:33.119" style="s2">question is I was so annoyed by the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:35.669" style="s2">I actually went to the bookshop the day</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.119" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">before got the staff to get her wretched</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.669" end="00:23:40.379" style="s2">butt off the trolley in the back whereas</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:41.999" style="s2">cific I bought it with my own cash my</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.379" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">owner hard-earned cash and then I read</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.999" end="00:23:46.679" style="s2">her book yeah that is by the way that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:49.229" style="s2">something I find I find an awful lot but</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.679" end="00:23:51.149" style="s2">I mean I read a lot of I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.229" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2">everything sadly but I mean I read a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.149" end="00:23:55.889" style="s2">of what you know people write that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.950" end="00:23:59.429" style="s2">disagree with but I rarely find the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.889" end="00:24:02.639" style="s2">favor is returned yes and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.429" end="00:24:04.830" style="s2">of covering for the fact that people I</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.639" end="00:24:06.779" style="s2">mean at least in that case she</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.830" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">acknowledged that she hadn&#39;t read your</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.779" end="00:24:14.969" style="s2">book and feet yeah oh well right so but</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:18.899" style="s2">people will often not even do that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.969" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">the amazing thing is that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.899" end="00:24:22.710" style="s2">argument is its own indictment right I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:25.799" style="s2">mean and you know you you made it very</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.710" end="00:24:27.359" style="s2">clear the idea that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.799" end="00:24:28.140" style="s2">Douglas Murray thinks and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.359" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.140" end="00:24:33.330" style="s2">to discover what he thinks is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:34.560" style="s2">hermetically sealed I&#39;ve got to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.330" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">by the way sorry I was on my mind I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.560" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">in Sweden last year and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:39.690" style="s2">Swedish translation on my last book</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:42.210" style="s2">strange south of Europe and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.690" end="00:24:44.310" style="s2">very unnerving experience of Sid being</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.210" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">interviewed on Swedish national radio</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.310" end="00:24:48.420" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t that nervous that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">absolutely fine but the infamy for about</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.420" end="00:24:51.480" style="s2">10 minutes and then because it needs me</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.070" end="00:24:53.370" style="s2">they need a discussion about me</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.480" end="00:24:54.750" style="s2">afterwards and so I&#39;m still sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.370" end="00:24:57.000" style="s2">the studio and two Swedes are brought on</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.750" end="00:24:59.250" style="s2">to have a discussion about me in Swedish</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.000" end="00:25:06.270" style="s2">by the way really unnerving because they</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.250" end="00:25:08.100" style="s2">say Lukas Murray I just and if my fake</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.270" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">Swedish should go out anyhow but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.100" end="00:25:12.930" style="s2">point is it&#39;s pretty compelling and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:14.730" style="s2">American so I wouldn&#39;t know but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.930" end="00:25:16.290" style="s2">summary anyhow but the point is is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.730" end="00:25:17.970" style="s2">I discovered after I sit to the side</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.290" end="00:25:19.290" style="s2">when do I leave because I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.970" end="00:25:21.870" style="s2">want to sit here listening to an</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.290" end="00:25:24.120" style="s2">argument about me and Swedish anyhow I</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.870" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">sidled out but I learned after and said</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.120" end="00:25:30.030" style="s2">apparently the left-wing journalist and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:32.190" style="s2">a journalist from quility we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.030" end="00:25:34.890" style="s2">the discussion and the left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.190" end="00:25:36.780" style="s2">journalist said there&#39;s nothing in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.890" end="00:25:39.000" style="s2">book that&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:41.550" style="s2">we could and I&#39;ve read and heard all</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.000" end="00:25:43.410" style="s2">this for years and and the journalist</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.550" end="00:25:46.590" style="s2">from Colette said have you read the book</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.410" end="00:25:49.350" style="s2">and he said no there&#39;s nothing in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.590" end="00:25:49.560" style="s2">book that&#39;s new that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.350" end="00:25:52.650" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.560" end="00:25:54.270" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s like look I I just I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.650" end="00:25:57.210" style="s2">give you a microphone and I will let you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.270" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">indict yourself it&#39;s it&#39;s the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.210" end="00:26:04.230" style="s2">answer yeah so alright you you raised</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:06.120" style="s2">the the strange death of Europe I will</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.230" end="00:26:08.160" style="s2">confess upfront I read a good fraction</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.120" end="00:26:09.960" style="s2">of the strange death of Europe I did not</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.160" end="00:26:11.730" style="s2">read the whole thing it doesn&#39;t mean I</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.960" end="00:26:13.530" style="s2">won&#39;t pick it back up</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.730" end="00:26:15.420" style="s2">so are you looking askance at me down</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.530" end="00:26:18.270" style="s2">your nose possibly that wasn&#39;t a scant</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.420" end="00:26:19.860" style="s2">look okay askance all right your your</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.270" end="00:26:21.990" style="s2">subtle with the facial expression so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.860" end="00:26:27.210" style="s2">have to it would have killed you if we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.990" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">been in the same room well naturally but</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.210" end="00:26:32.520" style="s2">let me ask you a question just to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:36.990" style="s2">explore further down this particular</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.520" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">minefield you make a very strong case in</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.990" end="00:26:48.210" style="s2">the strange death of Europe that Europe</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">has succeeded in producing many things</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.210" end="00:26:55.710" style="s2">of great value that we ought to guard</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:59.100" style="s2">carefully against that which threatens</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.710" end="00:27:01.320" style="s2">them that fair yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.100" end="00:27:03.030" style="s2">also as much as that must be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.320" end="00:27:05.460" style="s2">controversial statement at some level</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.030" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no analytical reason it should</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.460" end="00:27:09.450" style="s2">be a controversial statement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:13.020" style="s2">obvious that it&#39;s true you make a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:15.960" style="s2">strong case for it in a a thorough</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:18.840" style="s2">exploration but nonetheless let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.960" end="00:27:21.270" style="s2">say for a second that it is true and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.840" end="00:27:23.040" style="s2">discuss in that book in fact the focus</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.270" end="00:27:26.730" style="s2">of the book has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.040" end="00:27:29.970" style="s2">immigration and the threat that</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.730" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">immigration may pose to the achievements</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.970" end="00:27:38.700" style="s2">of Europe if it comes too fast and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:44.910" style="s2">this so two questions I want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.700" end="00:27:49.620" style="s2">with you one is the question of too fast</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.910" end="00:27:54.150" style="s2">is at some level it&#39;s an empirical</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.620" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">question is there a border of a rate of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.150" end="00:27:59.250" style="s2">immigration that is too fast for</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:01.320" style="s2">something that has existed prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.250" end="00:28:03.720" style="s2">wave of immigration to persist through</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.320" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">it right either there is or there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.720" end="00:28:08.700" style="s2">it may not be a simple number maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:10.470" style="s2">function but nonetheless we could find a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.700" end="00:28:12.299" style="s2">rate and we could say above this rate</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.470" end="00:28:13.799" style="s2">something happens and below this rate it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.299" end="00:28:18.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen and so maybe we want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.799" end="00:28:23.400" style="s2">stick below that rate but then the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.570" end="00:28:25.799" style="s2">question is how let&#39;s say for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.400" end="00:28:32.549" style="s2">let&#39;s just take the Enlightenment itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.799" end="00:28:35.490" style="s2">as a major European achievement the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.549" end="00:28:40.340" style="s2">Enlightenment produces tools of great</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.490" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">value right ways of thinking that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.340" end="00:28:45.750" style="s2">simply disproportionately useful it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.850" end="00:30:03.900" style="s2">if I mean we know all all societies</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.790" end="00:30:06.340" style="s2">change over very long periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.900" end="00:30:10.630" style="s2">the Greeks today are not what the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.340" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">were 2,000 years ago but yes I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.630" end="00:30:13.300" style="s2">the three things that I would say always</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:24.430" style="s2">is speed one is volume and third is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:26.860" style="s2">identity and I mean in a way the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.430" end="00:30:29.800" style="s2">that were links this new book and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.860" end="00:30:31.510" style="s2">last book is I want to be able to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.800" end="00:30:33.220" style="s2">aloud about these things because I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.510" end="00:30:35.860" style="s2">we&#39;re incredibly bad at doing so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.220" end="00:30:38.380" style="s2">being bad at doing so brings a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.860" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">cost you see if we in Europe for</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.380" end="00:30:44.110" style="s2">instance had been able to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:46.690" style="s2">reasonable discussions in recent decades</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.110" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">about this whole question we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.690" end="00:30:51.310" style="s2">have got into the state we&#39;re in in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">when when when Germany busy presses the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.310" end="00:30:56.170" style="s2">panic button and and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:59.590" style="s2">case on a range of these things and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.170" end="00:31:01.750" style="s2">just struck by the fact that that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.590" end="00:31:02.950" style="s2">know after years of what should have</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.750" end="00:31:05.650" style="s2">been a realization that we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.950" end="00:31:09.190" style="s2">having a proper discussion we continued</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.650" end="00:31:10.990" style="s2">to not have the discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:12.280" style="s2">you know all that you get time for bits</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.990" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">that I mean you talk you&#39;d ask about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.280" end="00:31:16.270" style="s2">the issue of numbers for instance and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:18.160" style="s2">thought about this a lot you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.270" end="00:31:21.250" style="s2">was doing firsthand traveling around and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.160" end="00:31:24.100" style="s2">reporting from the migrant camps in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.250" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">and after and you know there were some</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.100" end="00:31:29.350" style="s2">answers for instance in the UK was</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">pretty much agreed by by governments of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.350" end="00:31:33.310" style="s2">the last decade that they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.810" style="s2">get net migration to the UK down to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.310" end="00:31:35.920" style="s2">tens of thousands rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.810" end="00:31:37.660" style="s2">hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.920" end="00:31:39.790" style="s2">is there any meaningful difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.660" end="00:31:41.860" style="s2">between having a net migration of ninety</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.790" end="00:31:43.780" style="s2">nine thousand a year versus one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.860" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2">and one thousand no but it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.780" end="00:31:47.470" style="s2">recognized there was something in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:50.890" style="s2">shift from the five to a six-figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.470" end="00:31:54.070" style="s2">change that did had definitely in recent</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.890" end="00:31:56.020" style="s2">years been one of the catalysts for an</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.070" end="00:31:58.360" style="s2">increasing public concern about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.020" end="00:32:01.150" style="s2">whole area and I think that with all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.360" end="00:32:03.460" style="s2">landmines I&#39;m trying to clear in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.150" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">madness of crowds is that for instance</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.460" end="00:32:11.170" style="s2">we all know that the term transphobia</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:14.140" style="s2">can to be accused of transphobia can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.170" end="00:32:17.050" style="s2">serious damage to somebody&#39;s career but</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.140" end="00:32:20.490" style="s2">we also know that we should not</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.050" end="00:32:24.860" style="s2">medically experiment on children</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.490" end="00:32:26.730" style="s2">and yet we are stuck in like in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.860" end="00:32:29.520" style="s2">question that we&#39;ve had with migration</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.730" end="00:32:33.300" style="s2">in recent years if well we know there</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.520" end="00:32:34.830" style="s2">are two things we come we can&#39;t do both</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.300" end="00:32:36.300" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to do better and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.830" end="00:32:37.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean that&#39;s why one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.300" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">things I wrote about in the strange</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.500" end="00:32:41.700" style="s2">death of Europe which I told by quite a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:43.770" style="s2">lot of politicians across Europe and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.700" end="00:32:46.679" style="s2">elsewhere they found very useful after</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.770" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">the book was out to consider it this way</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.679" end="00:32:50.280" style="s2">was I said look I think you might have</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">heard me say this before I said look how</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.280" end="00:32:53.850" style="s2">about considering there are competing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:54.929" style="s2">virtues you know taking Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.850" end="00:32:57.559" style="s2">approaches so there are competing</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.929" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">virtues here it&#39;s not the case that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.559" end="00:33:04.590" style="s2">you know nice generous migrants versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:06.630" style="s2">European Nazis that it might be more</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.590" end="00:33:08.250" style="s2">complex and that it is more complex and</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.630" end="00:33:10.650" style="s2">that specifically in the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.250" end="00:33:12.510" style="s2">migration and mass migration that it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.650" end="00:33:15.480" style="s2">a I said it was a it was a competition</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.510" end="00:33:18.090" style="s2">between the virtues of justice and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.480" end="00:33:19.920" style="s2">virtue of mercy and that if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.090" end="00:33:22.290" style="s2">understood that or approached it like</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.920" end="00:33:24.270" style="s2">that you could start to approach it from</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.290" end="00:33:26.040" style="s2">a more reasonable position and one which</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.270" end="00:33:28.500" style="s2">you were more likely to arrive at some</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.040" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">kind of not just answer but consensus</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.500" end="00:33:33.540" style="s2">over and I think then that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.510" style="s2">trying to do with all of these landmine</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.540" end="00:33:39.870" style="s2">issues and the manners of crowds with</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.750" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">know it&#39;s all of these things are much</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.700" end="00:33:50.100" style="s2">more complex than our current public</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:51.900" style="s2">discussion allows us to concede so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:53.130" style="s2">would for instance on the transient what</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.900" end="00:33:55.410" style="s2">would it look like to be taking this</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.130" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">seriously to be looking in a humane</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:04.230" style="s2">and to try and to try to hive off the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.900" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">the decent and reasonable humane case</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.230" end="00:34:11.129" style="s2">from the absolutely batshit crazy no way</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:12.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do that Brigade and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.129" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">just stunned as I say on issue after</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.840" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">issue with this that that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">finding it this hard because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:22.679" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be this hard so if I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:24.389" style="s2">rephrase it just slightly it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.679" end="00:34:27.300" style="s2">that it shouldn&#39;t be this hard it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.389" end="00:34:30.690" style="s2">actually isn&#39;t this hard it&#39;s being made</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.300" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">difficult strategically yeah and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.690" end="00:34:34.440" style="s2">very confusing because not everybody on</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.440" end="00:34:40.889" style="s2">side is doing this but we are all caught</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:42.690" style="s2">up in it and so you know you do a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.889" end="00:34:45.770" style="s2">good job in the book for example of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.690" end="00:34:49.399" style="s2">parsing the border between queer and gay</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.770" end="00:34:51.960" style="s2">mmm god that was a fun border I tell you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.399" end="00:34:56.339" style="s2">well it&#39;s a very dangerous border but</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.960" end="00:34:58.650" style="s2">really dangerous border but years I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.339" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">so pleased to finally say it yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.650" end="00:35:04.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s beautiful I I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:06.869" style="s2">you saw it it was some time ago I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.250" end="00:35:09.869" style="s2">Unleashed a tweet at one point I</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.869" end="00:35:14.010" style="s2">survived it apparently but the tweet was</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.869" end="00:35:19.260" style="s2">something like if we were to eliminate</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:25.890" style="s2">right my thought being that the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.200" end="00:35:27.930" style="s2">letters surely cover whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.890" end="00:35:31.020" style="s2">Q is unless Q is a political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.930" end="00:35:35.540" style="s2">and if in which case why is it in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.020" end="00:35:42.630" style="s2">in this set of of letters so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.540" end="00:35:44.760" style="s2">the the problem is that if you took and</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.640" end="00:38:28.650" style="s2">abortion is always wrong because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.160" end="00:38:40.049" style="s2">think that least this manner of problem</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.049" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">more than we recognize and we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.599" end="00:38:47.009" style="s2">find a way of recognizing it so that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.469" style="s2">I realized this when I was writing about</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.009" end="00:38:51.630" style="s2">migration was that the the level of</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.630" end="00:38:56.189" style="s2">I think quite a lot of people wrongly</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.439" end="00:39:01.960" style="s2">mass illegal migration they thought you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.170" end="00:39:06.250" style="s2">would talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.960" end="00:39:08.200" style="s2">them or their mother or their friend or</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.200" end="00:39:15.059" style="s2">shop and and so they would never get</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:17.559" style="s2">beyond it and I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.059" end="00:39:20.140" style="s2">there are within all of these rights</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.559" end="00:39:22.420" style="s2">movements elements of that where people</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.140" end="00:39:25.450" style="s2">are miss hearing what the critique is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.420" end="00:39:26.859" style="s2">and burn and are being led by other</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.910" end="00:39:38.710" style="s2">and that makes it impossible to have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.099" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">proper discussion and I know by the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.710" end="00:39:43.050" style="s2">I should say I do recognize you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:46.119" style="s2">problem of that for people I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.050" end="00:39:49.809" style="s2">since the massive crowds came out and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.119" end="00:39:54.069" style="s2">few gay friends have said to me I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.809" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">believe you said that and I know what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.069" end="00:40:00.130" style="s2">is that they are worried about they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:02.710" style="s2">worried about me asking whether the</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.470" end="00:40:11.530" style="s2">actually said to me it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:15.700" style="s2">unhelpful at this moment yeah now my</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.530" end="00:40:17.770" style="s2">thing was it may be unhelpful but you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.700" end="00:40:20.170" style="s2">know for you or for other some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.770" end="00:40:21.430" style="s2">people but it&#39;s it&#39;s also what I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.170" end="00:40:23.380" style="s2">is true and what the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.430" end="00:40:26.049" style="s2">pointing to and but I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.380" end="00:40:28.569" style="s2">only to save that to each of the gay</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.049" end="00:40:31.420" style="s2">friends who said that since this book</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.569" end="00:40:35.290" style="s2">came out I&#39;ve said the same thing which</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.420" end="00:40:38.230" style="s2">is I happen to be gay myself and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.290" end="00:40:40.180" style="s2">know how that comes about but if I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.230" end="00:40:42.910" style="s2">told tomorrow there was a gay gene I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.180" end="00:40:45.099" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t feel anything very much and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.910" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">I was told tomorrow that more recent</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.099" end="00:40:51.010" style="s2">studies had found there was more of a an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">issue with you know I know environment a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.010" end="00:40:54.849" style="s2">bit of a particular age I I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:59.650" style="s2">feel all that much but why is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.849" end="00:41:02.230" style="s2">it&#39;s because the gay bit is really not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.650" end="00:41:05.950" style="s2">very central if at all central to my</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.230" end="00:41:08.980" style="s2">sense of myself or my worth or place in</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.710" end="00:41:15.549" style="s2">for me but I recognize that some people</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.380" end="00:41:15.820" style="s2">aren&#39;t in that position that maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.549" end="00:41:18.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.820" end="00:41:21.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a loving family or or</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.710" end="00:41:30.280" style="s2">think we should just dismiss that but at</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">the same time I don&#39;t think that facts</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.280" end="00:41:36.670" style="s2">can be elasticated to fit around them</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">no and it&#39;s very dangerous to try</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.670" end="00:41:43.300" style="s2">because later when it&#39;s discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:44.890" style="s2">you have gild the lily as it were the</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.500" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">place I will say this is I think why</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.950" end="00:42:43.120" style="s2">discussion and the discussion was this</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.690" end="00:43:14.380" style="s2">discussion in which there was just only</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.320" end="00:43:17.310" style="s2">a dispassionate analysis of people by a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.380" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">group who was clearly compassionate and</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.040" end="00:43:29.870" style="s2">have said who but but in any case the I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.880" end="00:43:32.680" style="s2">think my point is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.870" end="00:43:35.360" style="s2">that what you are talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.680" end="00:43:38.540" style="s2">difficult because it is a skill that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.360" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">most people have not been they have not</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.540" end="00:43:43.580" style="s2">acquired it either through training or</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:47.480" style="s2">through their own discovery and that if</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.580" end="00:43:52.250" style="s2">there is hope for taking the lessons of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.480" end="00:43:55.160" style="s2">your book and exporting them so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.250" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">more people can engage the argument at</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:43:59.840" style="s2">this level of sophistication then it</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:02.870" style="s2">depends on people becoming comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.840" end="00:44:05.960" style="s2">with the tool which it means putting</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.870" end="00:44:08.750" style="s2">aside you know the the story you tell</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.960" end="00:44:11.930" style="s2">about your your gay friends being</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.750" end="00:44:16.670" style="s2">concerned about you poking at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.930" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">question of whether or not being gay is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.670" end="00:44:20.420" style="s2">a hardware or a software issue by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:23.330" style="s2">way in analogy I also use and really</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.420" end="00:44:24.950" style="s2">really like it&#39;s it&#39;s so useful to think</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.330" end="00:44:28.310" style="s2">it just it&#39;s a clean divide and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.950" end="00:44:32.780" style="s2">everybody into its it but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.310" end="00:44:37.010" style="s2">thing there won&#39;t be a gaijin if the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.780" end="00:44:39.110" style="s2">data we have already is for real and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.010" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">know one can always discover that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.110" end="00:44:41.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:43.310" style="s2">data that you&#39;re not in a position no</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.900" end="00:44:46.250" style="s2">but assuming that the data is what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.310" end="00:44:48.340" style="s2">think it is there won&#39;t be a gauging can</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.250" end="00:44:52.730" style="s2">there be gay genetic influences sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.340" end="00:44:56.450" style="s2">that could be but there are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.730" end="00:45:00.950" style="s2">that are simply inconsistent with a gay</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.450" end="00:45:02.660" style="s2">gene and what&#39;s more I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.950" end="00:45:03.980" style="s2">questions are insurmountable as to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.660" end="00:45:06.110" style="s2">whether or not a gay gene could</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.980" end="00:45:08.270" style="s2">propagate evolutionarily but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.110" end="00:45:14.230" style="s2">simple question of how they would but in</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.270" end="00:45:18.040" style="s2">any case the to build the protection of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.230" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">homosexuals on the idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.040" end="00:45:24.070" style="s2">simply no environmental influence and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.440" end="00:45:26.600" style="s2">therefore as you argue in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.070" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">effectively it would be immoral to hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.600" end="00:45:30.890" style="s2">people responsible for something over</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:33.380" style="s2">which they had no control that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.890" end="00:45:34.730" style="s2">sound foundation now it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.380" end="00:45:37.970" style="s2">people have very little choice</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.730" end="00:45:40.850" style="s2">especially here we&#39;re gonna step on a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.970" end="00:45:43.150" style="s2">big landmine okay or I am you go first</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.850" end="00:45:47.349" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.150" end="00:45:53.049" style="s2">at least four males there is likely to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.349" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">be not very much choice because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.049" end="00:46:02.069" style="s2">switch will have been flipped very early</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">right so in any case we don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.069" end="00:46:08.109" style="s2">gaijin in order to fully support the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:12.130" style="s2">argument for compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.109" end="00:46:15.009" style="s2">understanding but it was a useful crutch</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.130" end="00:46:17.229" style="s2">before we had enough information to know</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.009" end="00:46:19.079" style="s2">what was going on and people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.229" end="00:46:21.969" style="s2">understandably reluctant to give it up</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.079" end="00:46:26.380" style="s2">yeah but by the way the landmine you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.969" end="00:46:27.670" style="s2">just deftly deftly tripped over it</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.380" end="00:46:30.009" style="s2">without least one once the fastenings me</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.670" end="00:46:31.779" style="s2">because I say to everyone who complains</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.009" end="00:46:34.119" style="s2">about what I&#39;m saying about the gay bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.779" end="00:46:36.789" style="s2">that when I say look it maybe it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.119" end="00:46:39.940" style="s2">more maybes a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.789" end="00:46:42.759" style="s2">mellifluous even after a certain stage</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.940" end="00:46:45.569" style="s2">than we pretend and that a gay isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.759" end="00:46:47.469" style="s2">necessarily as I say a one-way street</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.569" end="00:46:51.190" style="s2">even the people who object to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.469" end="00:46:53.219" style="s2">deeply concede I might be on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.190" end="00:46:56.619" style="s2">something in the case of female</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.219" end="00:46:59.410" style="s2">lesbianism right well cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.619" end="00:47:02.799" style="s2">definitely more there&#39;s definitely more</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.410" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">adaptability there than there is among</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.799" end="00:47:09.249" style="s2">male homosexuals but I mean for instance</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:11.229" style="s2">I mean you do sometimes there are some</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.249" end="00:47:13.660" style="s2">lesbians who have had horrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.229" end="00:47:18.009" style="s2">experiences with men or had a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.660" end="00:47:19.390" style="s2">husband or worse and they end up falling</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.009" end="00:47:21.999" style="s2">in love with a woman I do not know of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.390" end="00:47:25.140" style="s2">any case with a man who&#39;s married to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.999" end="00:47:27.759" style="s2">most horrible woman and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.140" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">starts to screw around with men I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.759" end="00:47:35.249" style="s2">yeah as a straight guy it&#39;s hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:38.170" style="s2">to imagine a woman that horrible but</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.249" end="00:47:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s it I&#39;m leaving you I&#39;m gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.170" end="00:47:42.039" style="s2">local gay bar</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.279" end="00:47:44.979" style="s2">as a result yep but I mean if you think</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.039" end="00:47:46.869" style="s2">about it look the reason that this</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.979" end="00:47:49.930" style="s2">should be more flexible on the lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.869" end="00:47:52.809" style="s2">side is staring us in the face it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.930" end="00:47:56.950" style="s2">obvious as you said it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.809" end="00:47:59.890" style="s2">gay men have a really and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.950" end="00:48:01.060" style="s2">again among the many amazing points that</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.890" end="00:48:02.830" style="s2">you make in this book that I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.060" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">heard anybody else say but you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.830" end="00:48:10.180" style="s2">we&#39;re begging for an exploration gay men</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:11.860" style="s2">have a problem producing babies the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.180" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">mythology of the moment may be that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.860" end="00:48:17.290" style="s2">don&#39;t but you know Monty Python</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:19.660" style="s2">correctly nailed the fact that a pair of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.290" end="00:48:22.870" style="s2">men don&#39;t have a uterus you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.660" end="00:48:26.230" style="s2">therefore that invites questions about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.870" end="00:48:28.780" style="s2">how it&#39;s going to be done women don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.230" end="00:48:33.100" style="s2">have this problem in fact a lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.780" end="00:48:35.830" style="s2">couple has a couple of uterus right what</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.100" end="00:48:38.710" style="s2">that means is that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.830" end="00:48:40.660" style="s2">opportunity here let&#39;s just do this</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.710" end="00:48:43.270" style="s2">straightforwardly in an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.660" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">sense human babies are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.270" end="00:48:48.280" style="s2">expensive to raise and they are much</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.910" end="00:48:52.360" style="s2">better raised when people team up right</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.280" end="00:48:55.780" style="s2">so a straight partnership is a team and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.360" end="00:48:57.340" style="s2">its primary objective is the successful</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.780" end="00:49:01.120" style="s2">raising a baby is the production of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.340" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">resources the nurturing the delivery of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.120" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">information on how to be a successful</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.980" end="00:49:09.820" style="s2">human a single individual has a problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.720" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">raising a baby there&#39;s just not enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.820" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">labor it&#39;s too labor-intensive a pair of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.570" end="00:49:20.500" style="s2">lesbians has the labor and the uterus is</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:22.900" style="s2">what they lack is a single cell right</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.500" end="00:49:24.220" style="s2">all they need is a single cell to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.900" end="00:49:28.300" style="s2">trigger a baby and then everything else</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.220" end="00:49:30.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve got right now there are plenty</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.300" end="00:49:31.900" style="s2">of ways that history can deliver a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.280" end="00:49:35.350" style="s2">circumstance in which there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.900" end="00:49:38.710" style="s2">enough men around for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.350" end="00:49:42.670" style="s2">warfare warfare will eliminate men from</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.710" end="00:49:44.560" style="s2">the map are we really to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.670" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">evolution will take a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.560" end="00:49:48.700" style="s2">who are perfectly capable of raising</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:51.100" style="s2">offspring and sideline them from that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.700" end="00:49:52.870" style="s2">most fundamentally Darwinian objective</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.100" end="00:49:55.990" style="s2">because there aren&#39;t enough men around</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.870" end="00:49:59.110" style="s2">for people to pair off oh no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.990" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">how it&#39;s going to work surely people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.110" end="00:50:04.450" style="s2">have everything necessary to produce</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.640" end="00:50:07.450" style="s2">offspring of their own will team up and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.450" end="00:50:09.310" style="s2">do so especially if all they need in</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.450" end="00:50:10.930" style="s2">order to trigger the process is a single</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.310" end="00:50:13.569" style="s2">cell they&#39;ll find one</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.930" end="00:50:16.300" style="s2">right and so the point is lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.569" end="00:50:18.490" style="s2">couples make perfect evolutionary sense</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.250" end="00:50:46.750" style="s2">right well you know I lay down that</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.339" end="00:51:07.300" style="s2">if I must all right so where were we we</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.400" end="00:51:11.079" style="s2">were talking about the understandable</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.790" end="00:51:32.829" style="s2">far safer if we explore this carefully</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.549" end="00:51:34.599" style="s2">than if we pretend the issue is simpler</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.829" end="00:51:39.460" style="s2">than it is absolutely I mean I mean I</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.500" end="00:51:45.400" style="s2">discovered should be careful of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.390" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">they wish for because even if they did</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.400" end="00:51:49.059" style="s2">suddenly rather unlikely though both you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">and I think it is even if they did find</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.059" end="00:51:52.420" style="s2">such a gay gene</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">uh what we would do about that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.420" end="00:51:57.010" style="s2">already had a couple of little glimpses</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:59.140" style="s2">of it I give the example that Alice</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.140" end="00:52:04.299" style="s2">of the unbelievable stampede that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.420" end="00:52:06.280" style="s2">occurred when one scientist was rumored</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.280" end="00:52:10.990" style="s2">a result was experimenting on sheep and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.869" end="00:52:17.710" style="s2">the gay rights groups were got up</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.990" end="00:52:20.109" style="s2">bye-bye Pete I think the animal people</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.710" end="00:52:21.910" style="s2">and and they whipped up the animal</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.109" end="00:52:23.980" style="s2">people whipped up the gay people to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.910" end="00:52:24.670" style="s2">for the guy who allegedly found the gay</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.670" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">and and he hadn&#39;t but they were so</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.690" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">enraged that this man might have done</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:35.740" style="s2">and might be doing something terrible</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.630" style="s2">with it that might for instance be</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.740" end="00:52:41.170" style="s2">taking homosexuality out of the sheep</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.630" end="00:52:43.000" style="s2">pool and you know so when it were</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.170" end="00:52:45.700" style="s2">clearly not gonna be any good with</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.000" end="00:52:46.569" style="s2">dealing with this if it was what they</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.700" end="00:52:48.280" style="s2">wanted either</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.569" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.280" end="00:52:53.170" style="s2">should say that&#39;s sort of why I started</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:55.270" style="s2">with the chapter on gay because I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.170" end="00:52:56.440" style="s2">to demonstrate in a way the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.270" end="00:52:58.809" style="s2">subliminal thing what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.440" end="00:53:01.240" style="s2">demonstrate to readers that I could do</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.809" end="00:53:02.920" style="s2">this with the one minority interest</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.240" end="00:53:05.970" style="s2">group that I&#39;ve got any alleged</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.920" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">involvement in to say well not alleged</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.970" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">but have any involvement in to say look</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:13.690" style="s2">and then we should also be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:16.059" style="s2">that on these other issues so it</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.690" end="00:53:18.220" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be this hard for men and women</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.059" end="00:53:21.010" style="s2">to talk about each other specifically</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.220" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">for men to talk about women and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.010" end="00:53:28.569" style="s2">making it much harder than it should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:30.369" style="s2">and you know I I sort of hoped that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.569" end="00:53:31.930" style="s2">becomes a cross so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.369" end="00:53:34.569" style="s2">it that way let alone then I get on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.930" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">race and trans but just to say look we</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.569" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">it sees a different manner of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">approaching these things we have to try</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:44.079" style="s2">to find and it has to take our purported</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:47.380" style="s2">characteristics it has we have to lean</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.079" end="00:53:51.339" style="s2">on them less I think what you do in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.380" end="00:53:53.380" style="s2">book with gay actually I think the book</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.339" end="00:53:56.260" style="s2">would stand without it frankly I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.380" end="00:53:58.569" style="s2">it&#39;s good enough but I think the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.260" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">watching you explore this in a place</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.569" end="00:54:05.589" style="s2">where you do have a dog in the fight is</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">it is exactly the necessary thing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.589" end="00:54:10.780" style="s2">demonstrate that the bad faith isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">there so in other words this is again</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.780" end="00:54:13.869" style="s2">why I say the defense against your book</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:16.990" style="s2">has to involve people not reading it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.869" end="00:54:20.890" style="s2">alright because watching you do this in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.990" end="00:54:24.069" style="s2">a place where obviously you have a great</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.890" end="00:54:27.089" style="s2">deal at stake in how society views gay</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.069" end="00:54:30.309" style="s2">men and you know doing it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.089" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">frankly that as I was a little surprised</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.309" end="00:54:37.180" style="s2">as a straight man that you dealt so</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:38.510" style="s2">carefully and effectively and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.180" end="00:54:43.820" style="s2">insightfully</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.510" end="00:54:46.970" style="s2">with the way a a straight man views male</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.820" end="00:54:50.180" style="s2">homosexuality which is right I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.970" end="00:54:52.369" style="s2">perfectly accepting I believe it that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.180" end="00:54:54.290" style="s2">male homosexuals are deserving of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.369" end="00:55:00.050" style="s2">protection but there is a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.290" end="00:55:02.359" style="s2">find I find the idea of being a gay man</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.050" end="00:55:04.970" style="s2">a bit distant I can&#39;t I can&#39;t relate to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.359" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">it very easily now that&#39;s why I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.970" end="00:55:10.760" style="s2">it there is something there is something</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:12.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a problematic to use one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.760" end="00:55:14.600" style="s2">terms of the era I mean I noticed it a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.980" end="00:55:17.000" style="s2">long time ago because there is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.600" end="00:55:21.020" style="s2">type of woman who for instance with gay</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.000" end="00:55:24.800" style="s2">men wants to talk dirty like they want</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.020" end="00:55:27.080" style="s2">to talk sex with you and equally there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.800" end="00:55:33.290" style="s2">a type of straight man who has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.080" end="00:55:35.290" style="s2">questions but not even just about what</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.290" end="00:55:39.770" style="s2">is like have sex with a guy but</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.290" end="00:55:41.690" style="s2">questions about sex in general like with</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.770" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">people and what I realized was this was</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.690" end="00:55:47.720" style="s2">a long time ago this came to me that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:51.290" style="s2">both parties thought that gay men was</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.720" end="00:55:53.660" style="s2">some kind of translation device yes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.290" end="00:55:56.660" style="s2">not even not highly wrong on it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.660" end="00:55:57.830" style="s2">entirely wrong right and and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.660" end="00:55:59.600" style="s2">and you see one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.830" end="00:56:01.580" style="s2">find fascinating about this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.600" end="00:56:03.470" style="s2">if you open up the gay bit a bit you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.580" end="00:56:06.200" style="s2">also get to some of the truths about</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.470" end="00:56:09.290" style="s2">male-female relations I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.200" end="00:56:12.830" style="s2">I loved that exploration I thought you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.290" end="00:56:15.950" style="s2">slam dunk tip well very kind I you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.830" end="00:56:18.770" style="s2">a bit with the women chapter was in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.950" end="00:56:21.260" style="s2">ways the most fun bit to write because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.770" end="00:56:24.350" style="s2">knew that you know I think I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.260" end="00:56:26.990" style="s2">before but I all the problems in this</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.350" end="00:56:28.520" style="s2">book I sort of boiled down to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.990" end="00:56:30.350" style="s2">that we&#39;re pretending to know about</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.520" end="00:56:31.880" style="s2">things we don&#39;t know about trans and</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.359" end="00:56:43.400" style="s2">is but you know some of the things of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.609" end="00:56:47.869" style="s2">recent years I did feel for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.400" end="00:56:50.270" style="s2">the in the post me to a period that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.869" end="00:56:52.390" style="s2">there was something that gay male</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.010" end="00:57:28.299" style="s2">power dynamics that the person who the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.779" end="00:57:30.460" style="s2">sort of intersection lists would regard</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.299" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">as being the powerless figure in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.460" end="00:57:36.339" style="s2">particular dance is actually the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">commanding the whole dance and that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.339" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">person whose society claims to be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:44.130" style="s2">person with unbelievable amount of power</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:48.970" style="s2">is a pathetic vulnerable manipulatable</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.130" end="00:57:52.059" style="s2">person in the wrong or right hands yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.970" end="00:57:54.910" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a marvelous description</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.059" end="00:57:57.160" style="s2">it matches perfectly what I&#39;ve seen so</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.910" end="00:57:59.769" style="s2">many times now including at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.160" end="00:58:04.500" style="s2">very personally where this naked</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.769" end="00:58:09.609" style="s2">exercise of power is described as</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.500" end="00:58:12.039" style="s2">basically a cry of powerless people that</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.609" end="00:58:13.299" style="s2">is and always will be unheated or</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.039" end="00:58:15.910" style="s2">something like that and it&#39;s it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.299" end="00:58:21.609" style="s2">know it is one of a thousand ironies in</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.910" end="00:58:23.079" style="s2">this area but but you you demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.609" end="00:58:26.740" style="s2">exactly the thing that I saw in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.079" end="00:58:29.500" style="s2">seminar which is the ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.740" end="00:58:31.930" style="s2">yourself not to pretend that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.500" end="00:58:33.819" style="s2">particular way of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.930" end="00:58:36.220" style="s2">isn&#39;t who you are</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.819" end="00:58:38.529" style="s2">but putting it aside with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.220" end="00:58:41.019" style="s2">what you conclude right you do a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.529" end="00:58:44.589" style="s2">good job of that in the gay chapter and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.019" end="00:58:47.200" style="s2">then it does allow you to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.589" end="00:58:49.029" style="s2">same to use the same analytical tools</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">with respect to race with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.029" end="00:58:53.799" style="s2">trans which is in some sense the hardest</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:56.380" style="s2">of these my guess is that&#39;s why you left</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.799" end="00:58:58.269" style="s2">it to last in the book and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.380" end="00:59:01.529" style="s2">trans kids being the sort of gold</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.269" end="00:59:05.690" style="s2">standard of really heart wrenching</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.529" end="00:59:08.329" style="s2">difficult issues but</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.690" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">you know I said something to chloe</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.329" end="00:59:15.710" style="s2">valerie the other day well i had a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:20.359" style="s2">discussion with her and i said you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.710" end="00:59:23.180" style="s2">the irony at Evergreen was that we were</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.359" end="00:59:27.170" style="s2">watching the breakdown of a college and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.180" end="00:59:30.769" style="s2">it was breaking down over the beliefs of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.170" end="00:59:33.890" style="s2">a group of people who more than anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.769" end="00:59:38.210" style="s2">else desperately needed a good college</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.890" end="00:59:41.930" style="s2">education and you know I can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.210" end="00:59:45.130" style="s2">make it I can&#39;t put flesh on the bones</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.930" end="00:59:49.190" style="s2">enough but imagine standing in a college</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.130" end="00:59:52.250" style="s2">watching a microcosm of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.190" end="00:59:54.680" style="s2">break down when every tool that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.250" end="00:59:56.750" style="s2">should need to solve the issue was like</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.680" end="00:59:59.390" style="s2">right there rendered in you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.750" end="01:00:01.519" style="s2">concrete and steel right we had the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.390" end="01:00:04.700" style="s2">buildings we had the library in theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.519" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">we had a faculty why don&#39;t we just take</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.700" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">the perspective that is being advanced</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:12.980" style="s2">and take it as a premise put it on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:14.839" style="s2">board and then explore if we extrapolate</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.980" end="01:00:19.160" style="s2">from this where does it actually lead</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.839" end="01:00:24.140" style="s2">and I have the sense that your book is</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.160" end="01:00:26.329" style="s2">in it is like I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.140" end="01:00:29.230" style="s2">textbook that&#39;s not fair to it but it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.329" end="01:00:33.529" style="s2">like the curriculum for such a</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:35.180" style="s2">discussion that I think so</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.529" end="01:00:38.630" style="s2">I&#39;d like to think so I&#39;m like it if it</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.180" end="01:00:41.150" style="s2">became so but I I&#39;m terribly conscious</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.630" end="01:00:42.680" style="s2">of what we&#39;re throwing out I mean as you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.150" end="01:00:44.390" style="s2">know I write about the Evergreen thing a</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.680" end="01:00:46.750" style="s2">couple of pages in the book because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.390" end="01:00:49.670" style="s2">did seem to me to be one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.750" end="01:00:53.059" style="s2">emblematic examples of this breakdown of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.670" end="01:00:54.980" style="s2">our our our day and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.059" end="01:00:57.740" style="s2">that fascinates me again in this is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.980" end="01:01:00.099" style="s2">people who wish to read the world in</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.740" end="01:01:02.930" style="s2">these rather ugly power dynamic terms</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.099" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">and keep missing out the fact that again</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.930" end="01:01:06.710" style="s2">in that sort of situation the power is</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:09.079" style="s2">exactly the opposite opposite way around</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.710" end="01:01:12.289" style="s2">the students have the power the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.079" end="01:01:14.509" style="s2">authorities have none and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.289" end="01:01:17.029" style="s2">all sorts of fascinating things that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.509" end="01:01:19.070" style="s2">can trace that to I think and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.029" end="01:01:21.859" style="s2">experience it firsthand but</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.070" end="01:01:23.540" style="s2">um there&#39;s an awful lot of cases of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.859" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">some of the madnesses I write about in</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.540" end="01:01:28.369" style="s2">the book where something similar is</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:32.859" style="s2">happening where the grown-ups appear to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.369" end="01:01:35.750" style="s2">have in significant chunks lost faith in</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.859" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">the process that had got them where they</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.750" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">had got to and they had decided at some</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:44.030" style="s2">level to hand over the keys to the kids</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:46.340" style="s2">and the thing that&#39;s so disturbing about</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.030" end="01:01:48.460" style="s2">that is not just the loss of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.340" end="01:01:50.840" style="s2">the loss of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.460" end="01:01:54.560" style="s2">unbelievable loss of opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.840" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">those students and others but that but</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.560" end="01:02:00.560" style="s2">that anybody who&#39;s been through an</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:03.230" style="s2">education knows that there are always</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.560" end="01:02:06.590" style="s2">times when you wonder if you could do</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.230" end="01:02:08.930" style="s2">that and if you could pull that move</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.590" end="01:02:13.730" style="s2">Ivan I remember it very distinctly for</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.930" end="01:02:16.730" style="s2">my student days if I try to use an</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.730" end="01:02:21.770" style="s2">insincere tool will it get me through</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.730" end="01:02:24.290" style="s2">and the job partly of Education or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.770" end="01:02:27.050" style="s2">is education being made into a citizen</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.290" end="01:02:27.710" style="s2">and the person in the world is is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.050" end="01:02:30.170" style="s2">adults</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.710" end="01:02:33.770" style="s2">turn around you at that point say Sonny</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.170" end="01:02:36.830" style="s2">there is no way around this you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.770" end="01:02:39.350" style="s2">go through it you have to just do what</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.830" end="01:02:43.609" style="s2">you need to do you need to do the work</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.350" end="01:02:47.690" style="s2">and there is no there&#39;s no cheap way</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.609" end="01:02:49.310" style="s2">through and I&#39;m just amazed that in</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.690" end="01:02:51.080" style="s2">subject after subject and discipline</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.310" end="01:02:54.200" style="s2">after discipline and institution after</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.080" end="01:02:56.780" style="s2">institution the implication is given and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.200" end="01:02:59.090" style="s2">sometimes stated boldly there are other</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.780" end="01:03:00.800" style="s2">ways around this for instance you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.090" end="01:03:05.030" style="s2">actually need to do the work you could</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.800" end="01:03:07.100" style="s2">call an insincere a card on a person in</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.030" end="01:03:08.710" style="s2">a more senior position and that will get</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.100" end="01:03:14.420" style="s2">you to the same place</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.710" end="01:03:19.250" style="s2">right and the jaw-dropping conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.420" end="01:03:22.280" style="s2">from this is that these students are</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.250" end="01:03:25.790" style="s2">learning but this is what they are</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.280" end="01:03:28.580" style="s2">learning is how to get by through this</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.790" end="01:03:32.869" style="s2">mechanism they&#39;re becoming expert at it</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.580" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">and the question is what world will we</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.869" end="01:03:39.079" style="s2">live-in as these tools are refined</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:43.700" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be wielded by people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.079" end="01:03:46.069" style="s2">ever more powerful positions and I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.700" end="01:03:48.980" style="s2">this is this is one of the harder points</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.069" end="01:03:50.390" style="s2">to make lots of people say well yes okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.980" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">the Evergreen thing was very dramatic</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.390" end="01:03:56.569" style="s2">Yael this that but it&#39;s a small number</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:04:01.309" style="s2">of people you&#39;re exaggerating I hear it</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.569" end="01:04:06.950" style="s2">all the time I think it&#39;s hard to compel</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.309" end="01:04:11.539" style="s2">people at you know it&#39;s like well okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.950" end="01:04:14.210" style="s2">smallpox is terrible but you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.539" end="01:04:15.950" style="s2">release was only a few cells it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.210" end="01:04:18.529" style="s2">in one part of the country and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.950" end="01:04:23.869" style="s2">no no it&#39;s smallpox do you realize how</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.529" end="01:04:25.309" style="s2">dangerous this is right so yes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.869" end="01:04:26.900" style="s2">small number of people wielding a</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.309" end="01:04:28.700" style="s2">tremendous amount of power</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.900" end="01:04:29.990" style="s2">learning to wield it better teaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.700" end="01:04:32.089" style="s2">others to do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.990" end="01:04:34.039" style="s2">distributing the toolkit through the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.089" end="01:04:36.819" style="s2">internet this could hardly be more</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.039" end="01:04:39.170" style="s2">dangerous yeah I mean and and and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.819" end="01:04:42.589" style="s2">though I just read this week about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.170" end="01:04:45.380" style="s2">case of the Seattle School Boards maths</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.589" end="01:04:47.480" style="s2">teaching curriculum where where they</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.380" end="01:04:50.239" style="s2">decide to do identity politics stuff in</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.480" end="01:04:52.579" style="s2">maths and you just go you know for those</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.239" end="01:04:56.690" style="s2">of us who were who educated in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.579" end="01:04:57.950" style="s2">humanities you know our only hope always</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.690" end="01:05:00.289" style="s2">is that at least there are still some</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.950" end="01:05:02.059" style="s2">hard sciences or a hat and this this</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.849" end="01:05:35.390" style="s2">one way through this or at least one way</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.119" end="01:05:38.569" style="s2">I started to think about this is how</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.390" end="01:05:43.160" style="s2">about how about we we try to work out</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.569" end="01:05:46.840" style="s2">like the the unpleasant questions which</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.120" end="01:09:11.910" style="s2">the worst oppression anyone suffered but</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:13.900" style="s2">I had a female black model former model</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.910" end="01:09:16.210" style="s2">discussing some of the issues in my new</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.900" end="01:09:19.480" style="s2">book with me she was very nice and she</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.210" end="01:09:21.280" style="s2">just wouldn&#39;t stop talking and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.480" end="01:09:23.710" style="s2">possibly because she was brought up in</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.280" end="01:09:29.770" style="s2">Scotland Glasgow and they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.710" end="01:09:31.350" style="s2">shut up in Glasgow and but but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.770" end="01:09:34.900" style="s2">reason I mention this is because she</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.350" end="01:09:36.780" style="s2">just wouldn&#39;t stop and she was and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.900" end="01:09:40.540" style="s2">knew at the moment I saw her she was</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.780" end="01:09:42.970" style="s2">uninterruptible and she knew it</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.540" end="01:09:44.980" style="s2">and chanyeol and she did is what she</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.970" end="01:09:46.420" style="s2">said the host Piers Morgan I see at one</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.980" end="01:09:47.890" style="s2">point said I just want to get dog as him</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.420" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">because because he hasn&#39;t had a chance</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.890" end="01:09:51.310" style="s2">to speak and I said well you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:52.960" style="s2">tried to come in and she said no I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.310" end="01:09:56.530" style="s2">he&#39;s spoken a lot I&#39;ve had to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.960" end="01:09:59.080" style="s2">him already and and I just thought okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.530" end="01:10:01.720" style="s2">I can&#39;t do anything about this in this</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.080" end="01:10:03.370" style="s2">studio this morning yep we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.720" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">black advantage and you&#39;ve got a female</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.370" end="01:10:07.900" style="s2">advantage already and the reason I</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.920" end="01:10:10.120" style="s2">mentioned this is because I think that a</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.900" end="01:10:13.030" style="s2">lot of people know this stuff I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.120" end="01:10:14.650" style="s2">she knew and I and I definitely knew and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.030" end="01:10:17.020" style="s2">I know the hosts knew</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.650" end="01:10:20.610" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of those things going</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.020" end="01:10:24.510" style="s2">around in the sious in the society and</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.610" end="01:10:27.010" style="s2">and we we don&#39;t have any of it out ever</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.510" end="01:10:28.990" style="s2">because we have all fallen for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.010" end="01:10:30.700" style="s2">social justice interpretation which says</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.990" end="01:10:33.300" style="s2">there&#39;s only one type of power and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.700" end="01:10:36.940" style="s2">elderly white heterosexual cisnormative</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.300" end="01:10:39.670" style="s2">power and and it means that there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.940" end="01:10:42.150" style="s2">these very mean the example I give of my</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.670" end="01:10:45.030" style="s2">turbine experiences a very minor one and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.150" end="01:10:48.370" style="s2">unimportant but but there are major</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.030" end="01:10:51.700" style="s2">weaponization zuv this power happening</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.370" end="01:10:54.100" style="s2">at major institutions all the time which</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.700" end="01:10:56.980" style="s2">everybody can see and no one can</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.100" end="01:11:00.220" style="s2">identify beautiful now I want to take</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.980" end="01:11:04.150" style="s2">your last two points because I think it</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.220" end="01:11:07.140" style="s2">gets even more dire if we extrapolate no</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.150" end="01:11:09.910" style="s2">doubt you will have seen this coming but</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.140" end="01:11:12.550" style="s2">all right so you&#39;ve got these ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.910" end="01:11:15.310" style="s2">create a kind of power an unacknowledged</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.550" end="01:11:17.680" style="s2">sort of power that schedules what can be</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.310" end="01:11:19.990" style="s2">said and who can say it and you know who</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.680" end="01:11:22.060" style="s2">gets to take up space in a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.990" end="01:11:25.030" style="s2">there&#39;s something like that and you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.060" end="01:11:27.790" style="s2">these ideas that become unexplored</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.030" end="01:11:28.960" style="s2">right so we can study genetics but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.790" end="01:11:33.190" style="s2">becomes difficult to study genetics</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.960" end="01:11:36.340" style="s2">anywhere around race or gender or sexual</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.190" end="01:11:38.590" style="s2">orientation and as you say the bridges</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.340" end="01:11:41.650" style="s2">will fall down well they will but</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.429" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">yeah yeah and I&#39;ve I&#39;ve very little</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:12.039" style="s2">doubt that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:14.199" style="s2">what happens by the way there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.039" end="01:14:16.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort of more mundane</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.199" end="01:14:19.690" style="s2">but more painful day to day thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.599" end="01:14:21.610" style="s2">notice which is I mean we hear a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.690" end="01:14:25.960" style="s2">talk about you know disenfranchisement</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.610" end="01:14:28.329" style="s2">and much more and but let me give one</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.960" end="01:14:31.809" style="s2">example of that is that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.329" end="01:14:33.429" style="s2">that emerging is that slightly more</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.809" end="01:14:36.610" style="s2">privileged if you wanted to play that</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.429" end="01:14:39.400" style="s2">game slightly more privileged say young</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.610" end="01:14:42.130" style="s2">white men are able to work out the game</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.400" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">and are able to adapt play around it do</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.130" end="01:14:44.020" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:45.820" style="s2">stupid stuff everyone&#39;s got to do to</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.020" end="01:14:48.850" style="s2">perform it but actually get what they</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.820" end="01:14:51.430" style="s2">want and the problem is that less</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.850" end="01:14:53.530" style="s2">advantaged including less intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.430" end="01:14:55.900" style="s2">advantage less economically advantaged</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.530" end="01:14:58.210" style="s2">people are going to get stuck in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.900" end="01:15:01.030" style="s2">game and I see this all the time with</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.210" end="01:15:04.210" style="s2">what I would you know the cuttlefish and</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.030" end="01:15:08.380" style="s2">I give I know I know exactly the type of</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.210" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">rich Western man who has worked out how</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.380" end="01:15:13.000" style="s2">to how to feminized themselves</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:16.210" style="s2">sufficiently around women to get to shag</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.000" end="01:15:19.570" style="s2">the women and I know exactly the type of</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.210" end="01:15:23.650" style="s2">man who is failing at that because they</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.570" end="01:15:27.460" style="s2">just haven&#39;t worked out the game yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.650" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s just it&#39;s a horrible</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.460" end="01:15:37.540" style="s2">horrible thing secret knowledge yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:39.730" style="s2">secret knowledge right and again it goes</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.540" end="01:15:43.870" style="s2">to your point about whether gay men know</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.730" end="01:15:46.780" style="s2">something that both straight men and</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.870" end="01:15:51.880" style="s2">straight women are fascinated by and</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.780" end="01:15:55.630" style="s2">need to know something about I should</p>

<p begin="01:15:55.630" end="01:16:00.520" style="s2">know is is a fascinating one it is not</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.900" end="01:16:02.830" style="s2">the only version of this it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.520" end="01:16:05.050" style="s2">strategy that involves many times across</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.830" end="01:16:06.790" style="s2">the animal kingdom right it&#39;s called a</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.790" end="01:16:15.820" style="s2">that anymore because it&#39;s tobacco</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.550" end="01:16:17.200" style="s2">ladyboys right but anyway the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.820" end="01:16:18.490" style="s2">evolutionary dynamics around it are</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.200" end="01:16:20.260" style="s2">fascinating but you&#39;re right what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.490" end="01:16:21.670" style="s2">effectively created is a niche for</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.260" end="01:16:23.490" style="s2">people who can figure out how to game</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.670" end="01:16:27.100" style="s2">the system in a particular way and</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.490" end="01:16:29.800" style="s2">anytime you set up a system that can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.100" end="01:16:31.450" style="s2">gamed and won by those who do it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.800" end="01:16:34.690" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to see and so we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.450" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">creating a a very dangerous environment</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.690" end="01:16:39.100" style="s2">in which even those who are well</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:42.460" style="s2">intentioned in setting this up do not</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.100" end="01:16:43.840" style="s2">understand that okay you may advance the</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.460" end="01:16:45.190" style="s2">interests of black people for example</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.840" end="01:16:47.500" style="s2">but which black people are going to end</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.190" end="01:16:49.690" style="s2">up at advantage in the end of this game</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.500" end="01:16:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be the bad actors in that</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.690" end="01:16:56.050" style="s2">group not the people who are most</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.040" end="01:17:00.760" style="s2">deserving so anyway we are we</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.050" end="01:17:07.930" style="s2">are in a terrible pickle in this in this</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.760" end="01:17:12.460" style="s2">regard and the question I guess I feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.930" end="01:17:15.130" style="s2">like we are in an arms race right there</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.460" end="01:17:16.600" style="s2">is an attempt to take over society and</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.130" end="01:17:21.480" style="s2">restructure the rules around these very</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.600" end="01:17:24.250" style="s2">naive syllogisms and and the like and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.480" end="01:17:29.560" style="s2">then those of us who are fighting back</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.250" end="01:17:32.530" style="s2">and blowing up landmines are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.560" end="01:17:34.870" style="s2">spread the instinct towards applying</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.530" end="01:17:37.540" style="s2">nuance and extrapolating carefully and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.870" end="01:17:42.670" style="s2">these things and the question is which</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.540" end="01:17:45.460" style="s2">of these two instincts will will win one</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.670" end="01:17:49.410" style="s2">thing that is maybe going to act in our</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.460" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">favor is that the point you make about</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.410" end="01:17:54.600" style="s2">even if the intersection list could have</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:56.740" style="s2">what they wanted it would be horrible I</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.480" end="01:19:01.540" style="s2">always eating itself either oh it so</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.910" end="01:19:04.540" style="s2">it&#39;s always eating itself because of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.540" end="01:19:06.850" style="s2">basic game theoretic instability right</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.540" end="01:19:08.770" style="s2">these coalition&#39;s function when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.850" end="01:19:09.849" style="s2">pointed in the same direction and at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.770" end="01:19:14.050" style="s2">point that they have spoil</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.849" end="01:19:16.420" style="s2">to divide they turn on each other and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.050" end="01:19:17.949" style="s2">one of the things that struck me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.420" end="01:19:22.090" style="s2">been saying that for a long time but in</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.949" end="01:19:26.170" style="s2">in reading your book it struck me that</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.090" end="01:19:28.239" style="s2">the question of trans women that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.170" end="01:19:32.619" style="s2">people born male who transitioned to</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.239" end="01:19:37.119" style="s2">female competing in women&#39;s sports is</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.619" end="01:19:40.389" style="s2">the first wave of the turning on itself</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.119" end="01:19:43.270" style="s2">because at this point trans is now</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.389" end="01:19:47.679" style="s2">backing women against the wall in a way</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.270" end="01:19:52.060" style="s2">that will destroy the hard-won access to</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.679" end="01:19:54.130" style="s2">sports that women have enjoyed for the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.060" end="01:19:55.599" style="s2">last several decades yeah as you know I</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.130" end="01:19:57.130" style="s2">think that I think the trans one is</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.599" end="01:19:58.929" style="s2">important because it reveals some of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.130" end="01:20:00.400" style="s2">what is actually going on and because it</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.929" end="01:20:01.929" style="s2">runs fundamentally against the other</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.400" end="01:20:03.790" style="s2">groups of distillation to have so much</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.929" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">in common with so it obviously runs</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.790" end="01:20:07.360" style="s2">against women runs against men as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:08.650" style="s2">but people less bothered about that but</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.360" end="01:20:10.119" style="s2">it runs against women in a very</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.650" end="01:20:12.070" style="s2">fundamental way which I tried to show</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.119" end="01:20:13.599" style="s2">and it also runs against gay which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.070" end="01:20:14.980" style="s2">one which I mean almost nobody has</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.599" end="01:20:16.659" style="s2">bothered to point out and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.980" end="01:20:18.219" style="s2">presumed that trans is just the next</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.659" end="01:20:19.329" style="s2">stage in gay but actually it runs</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.219" end="01:20:21.610" style="s2">totally counter to it</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.329" end="01:20:23.170" style="s2">so that the female tomboy and her teams</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.610" end="01:20:24.610" style="s2">actually might be told now actually you</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.170" end="01:20:28.179" style="s2">are a boy and we&#39;ll make you one</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.610" end="01:20:30.010" style="s2">and so I yeah I&#39;m very concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.179" end="01:20:31.329" style="s2">that I just by the way you started to</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.010" end="01:20:34.179" style="s2">say something there which led me to</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.329" end="01:20:36.429" style="s2">remember that that of course when we</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.179" end="01:20:39.099" style="s2">talk about how to get out of this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.429" end="01:20:40.869" style="s2">very struck that there are there are</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.099" end="01:20:44.500" style="s2">several ways what I tried to do in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.869" end="01:20:46.179" style="s2">book obviously is to undo the</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.500" end="01:20:47.739" style="s2">intersectional thing to accept that it</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.179" end="01:20:52.329" style="s2">came down to show that it how it&#39;s woven</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.739" end="01:20:55.449" style="s2">to unweave it and then to redirect</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.329" end="01:21:00.369" style="s2">people until I think and I don&#39;t I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.449" end="01:21:01.860" style="s2">as you know I&#39;m not dogmatic about what</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.369" end="01:21:05.320" style="s2">it is I think they should do but</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.860" end="01:21:10.389" style="s2">redirect people onto better paths and of</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.320" end="01:21:12.010" style="s2">the various options open to us those of</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.389" end="01:21:13.900" style="s2">us who think that people are wasting</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.010" end="01:21:16.480" style="s2">their time it does seem to me that a</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.900" end="01:21:19.599" style="s2">very important thing must be addressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.480" end="01:21:21.309" style="s2">which is okay let&#39;s say we can get lots</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.599" end="01:21:23.329" style="s2">of people out of this horrible</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.309" end="01:21:26.659" style="s2">retributive zero-sum game</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.329" end="01:21:28.670" style="s2">what ought they to be doing and and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.659" end="01:21:30.290" style="s2">I think that that we you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.670" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">that we can&#39;t get out of this unless</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.290" end="01:21:35.690" style="s2">that is also in in the frame and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:37.389" style="s2">very concerned about this and I give</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.690" end="01:21:41.989" style="s2">some hints in the book of what I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.389" end="01:21:44.000" style="s2">might be an answer I I&#39;m concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.989" end="01:21:47.449" style="s2">the opportunity cost in this generation</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.000" end="01:21:49.429" style="s2">of doing this stuff of this intense</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.449" end="01:21:51.739" style="s2">navel-gazing with the idea that if we</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.429" end="01:21:55.610" style="s2">gaze at it enough we will we will sort</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.739" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">out the navel and but but but in a way I</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.610" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">think one of the faster ways out of this</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:03.440" style="s2">is to say why don&#39;t why don&#39;t why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:04.670" style="s2">people for many disciplines start to</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.440" end="01:22:05.480" style="s2">talk about what we should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.670" end="01:22:07.969" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.480" end="01:22:09.770" style="s2">you know because rather like setting up</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.969" end="01:22:11.329" style="s2">a prize you know it&#39;s always a good way</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.770" end="01:22:13.820" style="s2">if you say you know it&#39;s ten million</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.329" end="01:22:15.230" style="s2">dollars if you solve this problem you</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.820" end="01:22:18.650" style="s2">you know it&#39;s quite a good way to solve</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.230" end="01:22:20.719" style="s2">a problem is why don&#39;t some people just</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.650" end="01:22:25.460" style="s2">start to work out what actually we would</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.719" end="01:22:27.380" style="s2">like to be doing and now it might be I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.460" end="01:22:29.659" style="s2">not a great I don&#39;t think the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.380" end="01:22:32.480" style="s2">life will simply be longevity and that</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.659" end="01:22:34.610" style="s2">if we all live to 150 we&#39;ve won because</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.480" end="01:22:38.540" style="s2">it&#39;s all got all the same problems we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.610" end="01:22:41.300" style="s2">always had but but there should be</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.540" end="01:22:42.829" style="s2">attempts I think and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.300" end="01:22:44.860" style="s2">not saying we need to fabricate them I</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.829" end="01:22:47.150" style="s2">just think we need to identify them</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.860" end="01:22:49.780" style="s2">accurately what as accurately as we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.150" end="01:22:52.790" style="s2">manage across many disciplines and say</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.780" end="01:22:53.929" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful you know it</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.790" end="01:22:56.150" style="s2">because the thing that the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.929" end="01:22:57.679" style="s2">just amazes me at the moment I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.150" end="01:22:59.210" style="s2">it&#39;s full but you know everywhere I go</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.679" end="01:23:00.829" style="s2">and I travel all the time I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.210" end="01:23:03.710" style="s2">different country every week and I I</p>

<p begin="01:23:29.929" end="01:23:35.630" style="s2">leave Russia and go to Paris and Berlin</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.329" end="01:23:37.060" style="s2">to pick up the latest critical ideas and</p>

<p begin="01:23:37.060" end="01:23:41.200" style="s2">just took such a long time and it was</p>

<p begin="01:23:42.190" end="01:23:45.550" style="s2">now we&#39;re not in that world where as I</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.200" end="01:23:47.620" style="s2">say when this extraordinary situation</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.550" end="01:23:50.050" style="s2">where anyone in any country access to</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.410" end="01:24:00.610" style="s2">of this so so why would we not be trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.550" end="01:24:03.580" style="s2">to work out what we can do in not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.610" end="01:24:07.030" style="s2">not harnessing but like unleashing that</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.580" end="01:24:11.800" style="s2">potential so I completely agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.030" end="01:24:14.500" style="s2">and I think the the irony of attacking</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.800" end="01:24:18.090" style="s2">not only the Enlightenment but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.500" end="01:24:23.230" style="s2">of enlightenment as if it was a con is</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.090" end="01:24:25.450" style="s2">the irony is just gargantuan and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.230" end="01:24:26.920" style="s2">right we are on the verge almost</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.450" end="01:24:29.710" style="s2">accidentally of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.920" end="01:24:31.960" style="s2">democratize access to all of the highest</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.710" end="01:24:36.580" style="s2">quality thinking and we are fumbling the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.960" end="01:24:38.620" style="s2">ball but you do you know what course I</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.580" end="01:24:40.570" style="s2">was teaching at the point that evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.620" end="01:24:43.090" style="s2">blew up golf</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.570" end="01:24:46.540" style="s2">go on now now there&#39;s no reason you</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.090" end="01:24:48.580" style="s2">should I just you mentioning that go on</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.540" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">oh it&#39;s gonna break your heart I think I</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.580" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">was teaching something called hacking</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:55.120" style="s2">human nature this was a full time 16</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.440" end="01:24:57.190" style="s2">credit course so I had these students</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.120" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">full-time it was my only job their only</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.190" end="01:25:02.650" style="s2">job and we were studying basically the</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:04.870" style="s2">premise of the course was it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.650" end="01:25:06.460" style="s2">to get the power to change civilization</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.870" end="01:25:09.640" style="s2">nobody knows how to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.460" end="01:25:11.710" style="s2">so let&#39;s skip it if we had the power to</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.640" end="01:25:13.540" style="s2">change civilization given what we</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.710" end="01:25:15.220" style="s2">understand about what works and what</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.540" end="01:25:17.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work what would the rules of a</p>

<p begin="01:25:17.950" end="01:25:25.960" style="s2">tool was really the trade-offs between</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.090" end="01:25:28.930" style="s2">competing values so at the so a I should</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.960" end="01:25:31.900" style="s2">tell you my students were entirely loyal</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.930" end="01:25:35.260" style="s2">the students that you saw were ones I</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.900" end="01:25:37.240" style="s2">had never met my students and I were</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.260" end="01:25:39.130" style="s2">exploring this question and we were</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.240" end="01:25:41.830" style="s2">deeply into that exploration at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.130" end="01:25:44.010" style="s2">point that evergreen boiled over such</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.830" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">that at the very end I had to hold my</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.010" end="01:25:51.010" style="s2">evaluation conferences off campus in my</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:53.230" style="s2">backyard in fact so I met with every</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.010" end="01:25:55.719" style="s2">student after after the fiasco had</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.230" end="01:25:59.559" style="s2">disrupted our ability to meet on campus</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.719" end="01:26:04.570" style="s2">and a number of them asked me if I had</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.559" end="01:26:07.989" style="s2">somehow created the entire catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.570" end="01:26:10.960" style="s2">to illustrate the principles in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.989" end="01:26:12.429" style="s2">program and that you know it wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.960" end="01:26:15.369" style="s2">they thought that had happened but they</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.429" end="01:26:17.619" style="s2">couldn&#39;t shake the idea because it fit</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.369" end="01:26:19.719" style="s2">so perfectly with what we had been</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.619" end="01:26:23.349" style="s2">studying very good of you to lay that on</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.719" end="01:26:26.019" style="s2">yeah yeah well it was you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.349" end="01:26:27.789" style="s2">ultimate teachable moment I guess but</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.019" end="01:26:30.519" style="s2">but anyway I agree with you completely</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.789" end="01:26:33.250" style="s2">what we should be doing is agreeing on</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.519" end="01:26:34.809" style="s2">the values as this conversation started</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.250" end="01:26:36.309" style="s2">there you and I seem to agree on at</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.809" end="01:26:38.530" style="s2">least a great many of the values maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.309" end="01:26:40.389" style="s2">all of them and then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.530" end="01:26:41.460" style="s2">well if you were serious about those</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.389" end="01:26:44.230" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.460" end="01:26:46.090" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna achieve perfection on</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.230" end="01:26:47.829" style="s2">any of them but what would an optimal</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.090" end="01:26:50.079" style="s2">balance look like and what rules would</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.829" end="01:26:51.730" style="s2">stabilize it would achieve it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.079" end="01:26:53.800" style="s2">stabilize it it&#39;s it&#39;s a fair question</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.730" end="01:26:55.809" style="s2">and we really we ought to be having a</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.800" end="01:26:58.619" style="s2">broad explanation for it much as even</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.809" end="01:27:02.110" style="s2">then and then what ought we to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.619" end="01:27:06.159" style="s2">you know that that is a the most</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.110" end="01:27:08.260" style="s2">enormous gap in our society is the fact</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.159" end="01:27:11.920" style="s2">that the adults have become distracted</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.260" end="01:27:14.800" style="s2">or lacking in confidence and have</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.920" end="01:27:17.380" style="s2">decided as I say hand over the keys I</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.800" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">mean never before have we seen phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.380" end="01:27:22.659" style="s2">where what he&#39;s not not not for a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.840" end="01:27:24.670" style="s2">long time where the adults are willing</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.659" end="01:27:26.380" style="s2">to tell the children what to believe and</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.670" end="01:27:29.769" style="s2">then say we must listen to the children</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.380" end="01:27:33.250" style="s2">because only the children know and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.769" end="01:27:37.239" style="s2">know for whatever the reasons are I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.250" end="01:27:39.519" style="s2">just struck that there is this vacuum</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.239" end="01:27:41.320" style="s2">and I wrote about this in my last book a</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.519" end="01:27:44.170" style="s2">bit more but it&#39;s all she touches on it</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.320" end="01:27:47.230" style="s2">in this one but that this vacuum of</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.170" end="01:27:50.380" style="s2">purpose and meaning and I know that that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.230" end="01:27:52.780" style="s2">is it&#39;s what it&#39;s what everybody hopes</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.380" end="01:27:54.940" style="s2">for in their adolescence in particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.780" end="01:27:57.730" style="s2">that at some point somebody&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.940" end="01:27:59.789" style="s2">stand across their lives and say let me</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.730" end="01:28:02.369" style="s2">tell you what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.789" end="01:28:04.019" style="s2">and what you should be doing and what</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.369" end="01:28:08.610" style="s2">would be a life that would be worth</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.019" end="01:28:10.199" style="s2">living and and it was it not everyone</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.610" end="01:28:13.039" style="s2">ever got it</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.199" end="01:28:16.710" style="s2">but to have a society in which no one</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.039" end="01:28:19.349" style="s2">gets it and no one is expected to get it</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.710" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">and we all just i know save up for the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.349" end="01:28:27.599" style="s2">next holiday is is not it&#39;s not not fit</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:30.389" style="s2">for the enormous lack of the situation</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.599" end="01:28:33.090" style="s2">we find ourselves in i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.389" end="01:28:36.840" style="s2">unfortunately the reason that we are in</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.090" end="01:28:41.460" style="s2">this predicament is that very few people</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.840" end="01:28:43.949" style="s2">actually reach meaningful adulthood that</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.460" end="01:28:46.590" style="s2">the adults are incompetent and part of</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.949" end="01:28:51.269" style="s2">why they are turning the reins over to</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.590" end="01:28:54.059" style="s2">the kids is not only do they not know</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.269" end="01:28:57.239" style="s2">what to do they wouldn&#39;t have the first</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.059" end="01:28:58.440" style="s2">clue how to figure it out and maybe it</p>

<p begin="01:29:01.559" end="01:29:07.159" style="s2">to the internet can be at the forefront</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.119" end="01:29:10.440" style="s2">of the most important conversations the</p>

<p begin="01:29:30.659" end="01:29:36.929" style="s2">causing people to stand up who otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.079" end="01:29:39.329" style="s2">might never be heard from and to</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.929" end="01:29:41.550" style="s2">participate in really bold discussions</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.329" end="01:29:44.670" style="s2">about well what is true of our situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.550" end="01:29:46.309" style="s2">and what what would be a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.670" end="01:29:52.170" style="s2">objective how do we get there and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.309" end="01:29:54.449" style="s2">i hope i don&#39;t think we can paint a well</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.170" end="01:29:58.170" style="s2">rendered picture of a good future but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.449" end="01:30:02.190" style="s2">think we can essentially figure out the</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.170" end="01:30:04.380" style="s2">path toward a a good future and if those</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.190" end="01:30:06.059" style="s2">of us who are inclined towards that</p>

<p begin="01:30:11.309" end="01:30:15.119" style="s2">or caricatured into a</p>

<p begin="01:31:58.010" end="01:32:06.560" style="s2">there is I think a single switch that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.599" end="01:32:08.969" style="s2">flipped differently in people who are</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.560" end="01:32:10.949" style="s2">participating well in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.969" end="01:32:13.980" style="s2">and people who are doing something</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.949" end="01:32:17.989" style="s2">perhaps more destructive and it is</p>
