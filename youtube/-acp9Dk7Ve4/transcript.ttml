<p begin="00:00:04.640" end="00:00:09.210" style="s2">Tim thank you for coming we first got in</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.710" end="00:00:09.990" style="s2">touch because of a shared interest in</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.210" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.990" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">you wrote the first article for The</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">Spectator I think at about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.549" end="00:00:19.130" style="s2">as I brought out my documentary and</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">Jordan Peterson last year and you also</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.130" end="00:00:25.949" style="s2">have a really keen interest in Alan</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">Watts and a lot of people have made this</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.949" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">comparison that Jordan Pederson in some</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">ways is doing for Western religion what</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">Alan Watts did for Eastern religion back</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">in the 50s and 60s I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:41.899" style="s2">interesting topic to explore do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good comparison well also</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.899" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">Alan Watts demystified Christianity I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">mean as Peterson is doing in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">he is a precursor of Peterson in other</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:58.649" style="s2">words he tried to rethink the real</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">meaning of Christianity without any need</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.649" end="00:01:04.229" style="s2">for magical thinking or you know he</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">wasn&#39;t religious in that conventional</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.229" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">sense you know that he thought there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">a great God watching us all you know he</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">was debunking debunking that idea and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">was trying to get at the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">questions of what the Bible was trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">to reach much often through the Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">Gospels he would he would refer to as</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">Peterson does also that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:34.909" style="s2">wisdom in the book you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">largely hidden from view by the church</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.909" end="00:01:40.700" style="s2">you know much of the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">about the Bible are kept out of sight</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.700" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">and I think in that sense he is he</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.630" style="s2">certainly a precursor to Peterson in in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">that he&#39;s involved in this great project</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.630" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">or what Peterson calls redefine the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:02.090" style="s2">substrate of the Western ideological</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">project if you&#39;re not ideological proper</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.090" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">philosophical project of individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">freedom and so forth and from what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">understand about the the Gnostics versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">the kind of Christian tradition is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.850" style="s2">the Gnostics were about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:20.210" style="s2">livid experience of God so it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.850" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">an inner spiritual knowing is that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.210" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know much about the Gnostics but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:28.890" style="s2">do think that sounds about right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:31.110" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what what was about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.890" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">you know he was about the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.110" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">present experience of your of your life</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">you know and about you know very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:41.460" style="s2">emphasis on that this is one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">he does differ from Peterson because</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.460" end="00:02:47.820" style="s2">Peters and in a way is is all about</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:49.800" style="s2">having a goal for the future and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.820" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">what&#39;s was not about that he was all</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.800" end="00:02:56.430" style="s2">about saying that the future take care</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">of its self which I think he he quoted</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.430" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">Jesus about that you know care not for</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">the morrow consider that it is the field</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">it&#39;s section which he said this is never</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:08.850" style="s2">really preached anymore you know because</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a subversive message which is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.850" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about tomorrow you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">you&#39;ll be fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">and that&#39;s quite quite contrary to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:19.470" style="s2">sort of things that Peterson talks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">the fine enough I you know last time I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.470" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">met Jordan Peterson I asked him that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:26.760" style="s2">very thing because I said well how are</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">you coping with all this pressure that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.760" end="00:03:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;re under and he said well you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">just don&#39;t think about tomorrow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.440" end="00:03:35.070" style="s2">constantly and I said what&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">paradox isn&#39;t it you know is this and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.070" end="00:03:38.070" style="s2">then you know anything yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">it&#39;s any way I can get through it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.070" end="00:03:43.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just blogged and living all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:46.680" style="s2">present all the time so oddly enough you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.110" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">know the idea there&#39;s something in both</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.680" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">of the ideas I mean they can both become</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.850" style="s2">corrupted in a way you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">you think of of thinking and living in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.850" end="00:03:58.830" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s goal-directed life you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:01.890" style="s2">I think very easily find yourself stuck</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.830" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">in the future so psychologically and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.890" end="00:04:06.300" style="s2">you lived</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">what&#39;s is non goal-directed life which</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.300" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">is kind of he was kind of anti goal I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:15.600" style="s2">think by nature of you know Zen Ness and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:16.980" style="s2">living in the now um you can get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.600" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">in that because I think that can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.980" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">quite a crisis I mean it&#39;s all very well</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:24.170" style="s2">to live in the present but you know if</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">sort of slap someone the round face and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.170" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">ten minutes later used to turn around</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:29.760" style="s2">them so you&#39;re still going on about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">fall that was ten minutes ago you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.760" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t make much sense does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:35.730" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a place for</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:38.970" style="s2">these things but but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.730" end="00:04:40.830" style="s2">both but what they have in common is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.970" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">they&#39;re both brilliant brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.830" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">teachers whose minds and not merely</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">great minds but have great communication</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:54.450" style="s2">skills that is quite rare you know for</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">somebody of that level of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.450" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">to have such a flair for expressing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">and also both of them really are</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">interpreters you know that in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">they&#39;re not known certainly what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">so than with them Pearson was not really</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">an original thinker he was just very</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:15.210" style="s2">very brilliant extracting meanings from</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:17.790" style="s2">other thinkers and other traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.210" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">Peterson to some extent no I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.790" end="00:05:24.270" style="s2">um you know he&#39;s more of an original</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">thinker but he&#39;s you know he realized</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.270" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">very heavily on people like nature and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:33.390" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn but he does formulate I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:35.850" style="s2">think I&#39;m Joseph Campbell but I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.390" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">think he he formulates a very coherent</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.850" end="00:05:45.410" style="s2">understanding out of us of those sources</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:50.910" style="s2">and moves them on I think in other words</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.410" end="00:05:53.450" style="s2">he&#39;s discovery as he would put it of an</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.910" end="00:05:58.140" style="s2">essential DNA of all the great stories</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.450" end="00:06:01.290" style="s2">which is something people have been you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.140" end="00:06:04.980" style="s2">know edging towards ever since the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.290" end="00:06:07.860" style="s2">Golden Bough and and the for the Fraser</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.980" end="00:06:11.130" style="s2">Book II think I think he moves out on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.860" end="00:06:14.310" style="s2">very long way and I think he really he</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.130" end="00:06:19.080" style="s2">really develops that theory of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.310" end="00:06:21.510" style="s2">as a form of expressing things that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.080" end="00:06:23.610" style="s2">cannot express yet by words which we</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:24.510" style="s2">cannot conceptualize and that&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.610" end="00:06:25.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s what which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.510" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">reasons are very interested in Peters</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.710" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">and Watts doesn&#39;t me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">narrative in that in that way so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">not a big difference is I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">is is concerned with mythological</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:41.260" style="s2">and what&#39;s his is not really his</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">interesting understanding what we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.260" end="00:06:52.300" style="s2">learn from Eastern thought how it can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:54.730" style="s2">combined with Royston religion and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.300" end="00:06:56.890" style="s2">they&#39;re both Mavericks because they you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.730" end="00:07:00.070" style="s2">know they take a very radical view in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.890" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">both cases not only of Christianity but</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.070" end="00:07:04.600" style="s2">I mean in what&#39;s this case of Eastern</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.600" end="00:07:09.430" style="s2">is very unlike other you know you read</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.550" end="00:07:11.530" style="s2">about pieced and philosophers and Zen</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.430" end="00:07:13.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all about sitting</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:28.750" style="s2">sort of he was very much of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.340" end="00:07:30.700" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think he became more and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">more of a Taoist as he went on because</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.700" end="00:07:35.140" style="s2">he also he wasn&#39;t much into self</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:37.630" style="s2">discipline which I think in Jordan Buzz</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.140" end="00:07:39.820" style="s2">Peterson is on the point of their</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.630" end="00:07:43.020" style="s2">differences and especially on the the</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.420" end="00:07:56.740" style="s2">what&#39;s also I think very much of his</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.730" end="00:07:59.320" style="s2">time and place do you think those two</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.740" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">messages kind of fit into two different</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.320" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">cultural eras do you think what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">was saying would have the same impact if</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.940" style="s2">you were saying it now and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:08.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very astute point I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.940" end="00:08:11.650" style="s2">they are products at their time you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.920" end="00:08:14.440" style="s2">I may think what&#39;s came out of a time</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.650" end="00:08:16.660" style="s2">when the culture was very uptight you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.440" end="00:08:18.130" style="s2">know and it was very you know who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.660" end="00:08:20.440" style="s2">much the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.130" end="00:08:23.080" style="s2">the tyrant king was running things you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.440" end="00:08:25.600" style="s2">know and it was very authoritarian it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.080" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">was very straight-laced I mean his peak</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.600" end="00:08:31.450" style="s2">was in the 50s you know just before</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:33.820" style="s2">nominee he was teaching through the 30s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.450" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">40s and 50s I think he started in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:39.460" style="s2">30s um but he was he was at a time when</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:42.820" style="s2">that as it were the straitjacket that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.460" end="00:08:45.970" style="s2">had to be loosened was one of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.820" end="00:08:50.920" style="s2">you know autocrat autocratic hype</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.970" end="00:08:55.900" style="s2">controlling fearful psychology and her</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.920" end="00:08:59.800" style="s2">now as it were he&#39;s take has been taken</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.900" end="00:09:03.310" style="s2">to his absolute extreme and peace and is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.800" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">as it were acting as the antithesis to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.310" end="00:09:07.750" style="s2">to bring it back to there to some</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">greater understanding again so I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">yeah you could see them once as two</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.120" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">poles of an underlying unity which would</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">be a very zen way of looking at you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:19.840" style="s2">I know you describe yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.990" style="s2">atheist what is it about these two</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.840" end="00:09:25.300" style="s2">figures that you find fascinating well</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.990" end="00:09:28.620" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.300" end="00:09:31.450" style="s2">they&#39;re both atheists a sense you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.620" end="00:09:34.980" style="s2">think with the word atheist is is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.450" end="00:09:38.440" style="s2">laden with kind of I think first I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.980" end="00:09:40.900" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to use that word because I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.440" end="00:09:46.770" style="s2">immediately want to distance myself from</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.900" end="00:09:50.440" style="s2">a you know dogmatic Christians and be</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.770" end="00:09:52.630" style="s2">new-age idiots you know so I talked</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.440" end="00:09:55.500" style="s2">about spirituality all the time I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.630" end="00:09:59.350" style="s2">I&#39;m very quick probably too quick to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.500" end="00:10:03.220" style="s2">the word atheist and it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.350" end="00:10:05.650" style="s2">the right word because it it suggests a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.220" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">Richard Dawkins kind of narrowness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:13.080" style="s2">mind about these things you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:16.630" style="s2">certainly not put it this way I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.080" end="00:10:18.040" style="s2">scientific materialist I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.630" end="00:10:19.720" style="s2">just look at the world and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.040" end="00:10:23.470" style="s2">seeing is just stuff you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.720" end="00:10:26.980" style="s2">absolutely don&#39;t think that at all is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.470" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">very very mysterious element which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.980" end="00:10:31.089" style="s2">revealed in science you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:33.730" style="s2">lose a thing controversial</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.089" end="00:10:36.269" style="s2">I mean when you look at quantum physics</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.730" end="00:10:39.189" style="s2">and recent scientific discoveries to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.269" end="00:10:41.709" style="s2">for it to be very plain that something</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.189" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">bloody weird is going on you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.709" end="00:10:47.350" style="s2">not just the 19th 18th century view that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:48.519" style="s2">we&#39;re all sort of hard machines and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.350" end="00:10:51.850" style="s2">that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.519" end="00:10:54.610" style="s2">so when I say I&#39;m a theist I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.850" end="00:10:58.089" style="s2">don&#39;t believe you know that if I believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.610" end="00:11:00.009" style="s2">in God this I will you know be rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.089" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">in heaven or in reward on earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.009" end="00:11:07.149" style="s2">necessarily and if I say I&#39;m you know an</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:09.009" style="s2">atheist it doesn&#39;t mean that it means I</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.149" end="00:11:10.779" style="s2">don&#39;t sort of you know if I see the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.009" end="00:11:12.370" style="s2">Buddha on the road I will kill him you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.779" end="00:11:14.709" style="s2">know so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s that sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.370" end="00:11:16.540" style="s2">of idea but where there&#39;s not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.709" end="00:11:19.660" style="s2">not there&#39;s not kind of a word for how I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.540" end="00:11:24.009" style="s2">feel myself to be which is somewhere on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.660" end="00:11:26.829" style="s2">the margins of a belief in a great</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.009" end="00:11:30.309" style="s2">mystery that&#39;s going on and there the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.829" end="00:11:32.529" style="s2">peculiarity of existence so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.309" end="00:11:35.199" style="s2">against I know it&#39;s not minute I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.529" end="00:11:37.230" style="s2">scientific materialist I hate scientific</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.199" end="00:11:41.589" style="s2">materialism I think it&#39;s a destructive</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.230" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">stupid ideology that is largely</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.589" end="00:11:47.079" style="s2">responsible for all sorts of problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:49.629" style="s2">and in today&#39;s world it&#39;s given us a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.079" end="00:11:52.529" style="s2">great deal but also psychologically I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.629" end="00:11:56.019" style="s2">think it&#39;s been a very arid and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.529" end="00:11:57.910" style="s2">inaccurate way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.019" end="00:11:59.709" style="s2">and growing up as I did in the nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.910" end="00:12:05.559" style="s2">fifties which is almost the high point</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.709" end="00:12:07.629" style="s2">of you know scientific materialism which</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.559" end="00:12:10.269" style="s2">really said this that he said if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.629" end="00:12:12.339" style="s2">can&#39;t measure it doesn&#39;t exist that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.269" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">the scientific view or the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.339" end="00:12:16.179" style="s2">materialism if you can&#39;t measure the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.970" style="s2">damned thing there it&#39;s it&#39;s a figment</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.179" end="00:12:20.499" style="s2">of your imagination and that includes</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.970" end="00:12:21.339" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s like we can&#39;t measure</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.499" end="00:12:23.009" style="s2">consciousness so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.339" end="00:12:25.870" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s an epiphenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.009" end="00:12:27.639" style="s2">you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.870" end="00:12:30.819" style="s2">and that&#39;s just like saying yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.639" end="00:12:32.230" style="s2">you know but you&#39;re thinking that how</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.819" end="00:12:34.329" style="s2">come you&#39;re thinking that if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.230" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">that people now I mean is there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.329" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">denying the most fundamental reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:40.809" style="s2">that we have which is the inside of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:42.680" style="s2">own heads which is our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.809" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.680" end="00:12:47.270" style="s2">we are reality than that people say well</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:48.770" style="s2">that&#39;s not real what the hell is real</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.270" end="00:12:51.410" style="s2">you know if that&#39;s not real that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.770" end="00:12:54.620" style="s2">ridiculous and that is kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.410" end="00:12:57.260" style="s2">things are all too common I think and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.620" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">that&#39;s really the in as much as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.260" end="00:13:03.110" style="s2">thought about at all you might call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.060" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">the default view of this society it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.110" end="00:13:09.380" style="s2">strikes me just on that point that both</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:12.130" style="s2">warts and Peterson have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.380" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">metaphysical element what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.130" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">may be in different ways that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">know that&#39;s actually my question is are</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.790" style="s2">it from you know East and West and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.620" style="s2">ostensibly quite different are they</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.790" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">pointing to some similar metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.620" end="00:13:29.779" style="s2">reality do you think or is it different</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.750" end="00:13:41.570" style="s2">there is a metaphysical we arty now was</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.750" end="00:13:51.709" style="s2">it&#39;s good in a way are they not both</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.880" end="00:13:54.290" style="s2">pointing to the I mean you described as</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.709" end="00:13:56.690" style="s2">a mystery there is a humility in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.290" end="00:13:58.459" style="s2">Peterson I don&#39;t know what&#39;s quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.690" end="00:14:00.770" style="s2">so well but I get a sense there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.459" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">humidity and both of there so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.770" end="00:14:05.779" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good point because what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.560" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">it&#39;s about is is the acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.779" end="00:14:11.540" style="s2">uncertainty you know I mean I and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">Peterson is very big on this assignee</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:15.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t know anything you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:16.459" style="s2">small and the world is very big you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.080" end="00:14:18.740" style="s2">got a whole of history before you the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.459" end="00:14:20.540" style="s2">whole of the future ahead of you and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.740" end="00:14:23.060" style="s2">whole world around you and you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.540" end="00:14:23.690" style="s2">tiny little grunt you know have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.060" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.690" end="00:14:28.040" style="s2">what the hell do you know you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">I&#39;m what&#39;s is one what&#39;s his greatest</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.040" end="00:14:33.890" style="s2">books was the wisdom of insecurity which</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:34.940" style="s2">is really the same principle is saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.890" end="00:14:37.490" style="s2">look you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.940" end="00:14:40.130" style="s2">you know how humility in the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.490" end="00:14:42.380" style="s2">mystery which is that in reality you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.130" end="00:14:45.970" style="s2">know things are very very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.380" end="00:14:48.020" style="s2">understand and I suppose that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.970" end="00:14:50.390" style="s2">perception I&#39;ve had with me since I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.020" end="00:14:53.209" style="s2">quieter well as long as I can remember</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.390" end="00:14:55.790" style="s2">he&#39;s like what the hell is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.209" end="00:14:56.010" style="s2">why is everybody so down with it you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.790" end="00:14:58.260" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.010" end="00:15:00.810" style="s2">because it strikes me as bizarre and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.260" end="00:15:03.180" style="s2">perplexing and um and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.810" end="00:15:05.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to most people urgency to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.180" end="00:15:09.630" style="s2">register there and so they both speak to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.790" end="00:15:13.140" style="s2">me in saying you know life is ineffable</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.630" end="00:15:15.870" style="s2">and unknowable so they&#39;re very much both</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.140" end="00:15:17.700" style="s2">in the same camp now but it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.870" end="00:15:20.490" style="s2">like their response to that is different</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.700" end="00:15:22.130" style="s2">because for what&#39;s and the more Daoist</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:27.020" style="s2">response to that would be to surrender</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.130" end="00:15:29.280" style="s2">into the unknowable mystery and your ego</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.020" end="00:15:32.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t trying to control it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.280" end="00:15:35.340" style="s2">whereas peterson is saying to an extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.490" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">at least find meaning find</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.340" end="00:15:40.080" style="s2">responsibility you know find some</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.460" style="s2">directions and go in the future and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.080" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">not sure whether those things square</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.460" end="00:15:44.610" style="s2">with each other I don&#39;t think those do</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:48.090" style="s2">square with each other but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.610" end="00:15:50.010" style="s2">that sort of walks you in a stroke</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.090" end="00:15:55.280" style="s2">Eastern point of view is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.010" end="00:16:00.510" style="s2">an essential inner wisdom that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.280" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">we don&#39;t use enough you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.510" end="00:16:04.760" style="s2">that we need to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:08.310" style="s2">mysterious Center of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.760" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">which which is the the heart of real</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.310" end="00:16:13.560" style="s2">knowing as a piece I&#39;m not sure except</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:15.990" style="s2">that I would say that he does speak very</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.560" end="00:16:18.750" style="s2">much about humility he speaks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.990" end="00:16:21.240" style="s2">about how you know you have to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.750" end="00:16:25.260" style="s2">beginnings of wisdom as the fear of God</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:27.210" style="s2">the idea that you and and the and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.260" end="00:16:30.390" style="s2">Satan was an intellectual and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.210" end="00:16:31.980" style="s2">no idea that that the knowledge that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.390" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">possess is the beginning and the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.980" end="00:16:36.930" style="s2">the world is that you know the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:39.690" style="s2">sin of pride you know and and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.930" end="00:16:43.610" style="s2">actually they are quite similar in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.690" end="00:16:47.310" style="s2">because they&#39;re saying just understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.610" end="00:16:50.820" style="s2">you know your place in things which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.310" end="00:16:53.520" style="s2">at one level as what say you know there</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:16:56.810" style="s2">is something godlike in you but you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.520" end="00:16:59.190" style="s2">the human side of you is is woefully</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.810" end="00:17:01.320" style="s2">inadequate you know I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.190" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of yeah I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.320" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s interesting how what&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:07.890" style="s2">wear how julen pleases was about how</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:09.420" style="s2">your your pathetic little weasel</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.890" end="00:17:12.179" style="s2">you know he&#39;s gotta this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.420" end="00:17:14.069" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re essentially in originated</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.179" end="00:17:17.309" style="s2">this kind of original sinner idea that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.069" end="00:17:20.429" style="s2">you are just weak and and pathetic and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.309" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">think that would be quite alien towards</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.429" end="00:17:26.370" style="s2">who is sort of you know much more this</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:29.549" style="s2">sort of you know what&#39;s inside you is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.370" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">can be relied upon even though it can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.549" end="00:17:33.570" style="s2">unreliable you know so so he you know he</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:35.490" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t make the point as always trust</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.570" end="00:17:37.410" style="s2">you know always trust your inner voice</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.490" end="00:17:41.010" style="s2">he said you&#39;re in the position where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.410" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">have life is essentially to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.010" end="00:17:49.410" style="s2">position of a gambler who is making bets</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:52.500" style="s2">and there are no certain outcomes or or</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.410" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">a yachtsman who&#39;s trying to tack and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:18:01.530" style="s2">sail through very unpredictable waters</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:06.150" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s no clear way forward</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.530" end="00:18:07.740" style="s2">and you have no guarantees of a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.150" end="00:18:10.049" style="s2">outcome and I think now you know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.740" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">unlike religion which even even Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.049" end="00:18:14.130" style="s2">which says you know just meditation</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:16.440" style="s2">you&#39;ll be everything will be beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.130" end="00:18:18.630" style="s2">that&#39;s like really you know and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.440" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">and Peterson likewise you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.630" end="00:18:23.880" style="s2">go you know this is the this is your</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:25.650" style="s2">best bet is to follow this path but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.880" end="00:18:27.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t guarantee anything you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.650" end="00:18:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it you know you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.419" end="00:18:31.020" style="s2">horrible bad luck and dreadful things</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.880" end="00:18:33.510" style="s2">can happen to you and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.020" end="00:18:36.210" style="s2">controlling those things it&#39;s just you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.510" end="00:18:39.030" style="s2">know it&#39;s just bad happens to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.210" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">people and you can&#39;t control that so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.030" end="00:18:43.950" style="s2">this sort of yeah does there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.660" style="s2">element you know if you humility I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.950" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">certainly think what&#39;s is more about as</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.660" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">you say letting go the need to control</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.610" end="00:18:53.910" style="s2">things but there&#39;s an element of that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">think in Jordan Peterson too and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.910" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and in a sense letting go the need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:00.179" style="s2">know things in a strange way you know or</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">they need to know of your certainties</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.179" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">would you say there&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">utopianism in what&#39;s because with</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.210" end="00:19:08.100" style="s2">Peterson he says you have to take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">poison or all you have is the choice of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.100" end="00:19:12.179" style="s2">which poison to take you have to take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:14.520" style="s2">poison or as what there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.179" end="00:19:18.179" style="s2">sense of maybe a bit more of a utopian</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.520" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">element to it I don&#39;t think is utopian I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.179" end="00:19:22.980" style="s2">think it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">probably more optimistic you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.980" end="00:19:29.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t think he thinks there&#39;s some I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">don&#39;t think he sees the utility of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.790" end="00:19:37.620" style="s2">sufferin perhaps that&#39;s in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:40.770" style="s2">you know Jordan Peterson does he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.620" end="00:19:42.540" style="s2">necessarily think one should be beating</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.770" end="00:19:44.070" style="s2">one selves up and it&#39;s probably nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.540" end="00:19:46.020" style="s2">you never probably know I did this P</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.070" end="00:19:47.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t be fair but I mean you know I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.020" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s not that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.820" end="00:19:54.600" style="s2">sort of sense you&#39;ve got to go down as</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">the depths before you can emerge fully</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.600" end="00:19:59.430" style="s2">formed</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:20:00.870" style="s2">I think what&#39;s is just like just stop</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.430" end="00:20:04.020" style="s2">trying so hard and you&#39;ll be all right</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.870" end="00:20:06.750" style="s2">you know that&#39;s because some up is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.020" end="00:20:10.260" style="s2">know just to stop straining you know to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:12.060" style="s2">do things and and what&#39;s was much</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.260" end="00:20:13.770" style="s2">misunderstood at the time what&#39;s didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.060" end="00:20:17.010" style="s2">like that beatniks for instance you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.770" end="00:20:18.990" style="s2">the whole Kerouac do what you feel type</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.010" end="00:20:21.930" style="s2">of thing he&#39;s very much just disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.990" end="00:20:26.010" style="s2">of that nonsense I thought it was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.930" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">very had a lesson really so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.010" end="00:20:33.210" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there are differences</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">and there are similarities but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.210" end="00:20:39.300" style="s2">that they were on the same path and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:40.620" style="s2">had a lot of admiration for young even</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.300" end="00:20:42.360" style="s2">though he didn&#39;t talk about it requires</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.620" end="00:20:43.530" style="s2">as much as Jordan Peterson and maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.360" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t playing that same role of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.530" end="00:20:49.620" style="s2">reviving him to the culture but one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:51.980" style="s2">one of my favorite lectures he talks</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.620" end="00:20:54.600" style="s2">about young in the shadow in particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.980" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">and that striking is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.600" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">point where they they meet because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:02.100" style="s2">shadow is maybe one of the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:06.030" style="s2">Union ideas that Peterson is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.100" end="00:21:08.340" style="s2">back into the culture so I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.030" end="00:21:10.050" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know much about Watson his</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.340" end="00:21:12.090" style="s2">take on young but how much do you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.050" end="00:21:15.720" style="s2">young kind of influences thinking or how</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.090" end="00:21:17.640" style="s2">important was it not really aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.720" end="00:21:19.080" style="s2">I mean you know it must have I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.640" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2">know maybe there and if you&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.080" end="00:21:23.190" style="s2">lecture but it hasn&#39;t stuck with me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.150" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">sort of seen everything and listened to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.190" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">everything that he&#39;s done so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:28.770" style="s2">imagine it was a repeating motif I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">I&#39;d have to say I&#39;d be very interested</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.770" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">to see that that sure but I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:34.190" style="s2">know I don&#39;t remember he talked talks</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:36.509" style="s2">about fraud</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.190" end="00:21:38.759" style="s2">of course young was into Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.509" end="00:21:40.409" style="s2">philosophy himself and and any and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.759" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t immediately think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.409" end="00:21:45.230" style="s2">Yungas he frames it in those terms but</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:48.360" style="s2">but actual facts the idea of there being</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.230" end="00:21:50.549" style="s2">polarities within us you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.360" end="00:21:53.460" style="s2">essentially that the Union was that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.549" end="00:21:55.590" style="s2">everything&#39;s opposing forces you know is</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.460" end="00:21:57.389" style="s2">exactly what he I&#39;m you said he&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.590" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">the book is all about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.389" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">polarities that that that are at working</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:06.029" style="s2">inside the human psyche I know how much</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:07.649" style="s2">this is referring to the question you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.029" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">asked me her but it was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.649" end="00:22:18.090" style="s2">thinking about while you were asking it</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:23.490" style="s2">and it makes me think that this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.090" end="00:22:25.019" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if balance is the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.490" end="00:22:27.179" style="s2">word but they said it but certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.019" end="00:22:29.190" style="s2">idea that there are that what appear to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.179" end="00:22:32.789" style="s2">be opposites are in fact not opposites</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.190" end="00:22:34.470" style="s2">at all but are in fact you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.789" end="00:22:36.179" style="s2">that the more you push in one direction</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:38.490" style="s2">the more that goes in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.179" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">where you going there&#39;s in the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.490" end="00:22:42.090" style="s2">would he would he would talk the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">about things like free will saying you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.090" end="00:22:46.529" style="s2">know what it depends if you look at in</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.730" end="00:22:47.940" style="s2">one way it&#39;s free world look at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.529" end="00:22:49.559" style="s2">other way it&#39;s total determinism if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:50.639" style="s2">push past that determiners and looks</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.559" end="00:22:57.090" style="s2">like pretty well there&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.639" end="00:22:59.730" style="s2">flipping of these of these two poles so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.090" end="00:23:02.009" style="s2">and he talks about women are lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.730" end="00:23:04.379" style="s2">same way as peace and does for the male</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.009" end="00:23:07.139" style="s2">and the female he talks about those</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.379" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">archetypes of the woman being unknowable</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.139" end="00:23:12.419" style="s2">and dark and represented by the earth</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:15.419" style="s2">and the underground you know and and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.419" end="00:23:17.639" style="s2">she&#39;ll be damned if she&#39;ll be known you</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.419" end="00:23:20.840" style="s2">know the women are always unknowable in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.639" end="00:23:23.100" style="s2">his his view and and men are much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.840" end="00:23:25.289" style="s2">but he always divides the world into</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.100" end="00:23:27.450" style="s2">spiky and wiggly I think you know and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.289" end="00:23:29.490" style="s2">and and the men are much more spiky you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.450" end="00:23:32.580" style="s2">know can you didn&#39;t demonstrate exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.490" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">this and this and this and sort of and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.580" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">women are much more like water and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.519" style="s2">idea that they&#39;re much more and these</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:40.930" style="s2">sort of ideas of gender these are kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.519" end="00:23:43.690" style="s2">of taboo ideas in the sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.930" end="00:23:45.820" style="s2">on the left in politics today the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.690" end="00:23:47.560" style="s2">that there can be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.820" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">fundamental difference in the male and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.560" end="00:23:55.000" style="s2">female principles but clearly it was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:56.500" style="s2">union to that extent and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.000" end="00:23:58.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a real shame those kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.500" end="00:24:00.490" style="s2">there unsayable it&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.150" end="00:24:03.220" style="s2">that we seem to have lost our wires as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.490" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">thinking culture because once we start</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.220" end="00:24:08.440" style="s2">to deny the way their different ways men</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:11.170" style="s2">and women put their world together you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.440" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">know and say oh well that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.170" end="00:24:16.840" style="s2">that&#39;s either irrelevant or it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:19.860" style="s2">exist or worse it&#39;s offensive or</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.840" end="00:24:23.710" style="s2">oppressive to even suggest the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.860" end="00:24:26.590" style="s2">strikes me as a very dangerous denial of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.710" end="00:24:29.650" style="s2">reality I wonder if part of it is due to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.590" end="00:24:32.680" style="s2">the fact that so was pointed out that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.650" end="00:24:34.060" style="s2">the Western mindset we can see objects</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.680" end="00:24:36.130" style="s2">and they&#39;re distinct from one another</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.060" end="00:24:37.990" style="s2">and in the Eastern mind said especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.130" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">Taoism there&#39;s more sense of things in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.990" end="00:24:41.710" style="s2">each for your eyes like a flower and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">bee are in essence the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.710" end="00:24:45.250" style="s2">they can exist without each other really</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.370" style="s2">different ways to see the world I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:51.250" style="s2">he even uses the example somewhere of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.370" end="00:24:52.900" style="s2">Japanese art and argue my phone in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.250" end="00:24:54.280" style="s2">motel in the Midwest in America where</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.900" end="00:24:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like a fruit bowl it&#39;s right in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.280" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">your face and there&#39;s hardly any space</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.570" end="00:24:58.510" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">whereas in Japanese art a lot of white</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.510" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">space and just an object in the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">order of human figure is tiny and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:07.390" style="s2">the natural landscape is enormous as</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:11.410" style="s2">opposed to the man on his horse in</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">England being in the foreground yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.410" end="00:25:17.110" style="s2">what&#39;s the so for me the point is we</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:19.270" style="s2">find it incredibly difficult to even</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.110" end="00:25:21.430" style="s2">hold that idea that polarities can imply</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.270" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">one another rather than one being better</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.430" end="00:25:27.100" style="s2">than the other exactly and what I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:28.930" style="s2">gonna ask is so very early on in one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.100" end="00:25:31.030" style="s2">the Bible lectures Peterson mentions</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.930" end="00:25:33.160" style="s2">almost offhand he quite like to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.030" end="00:25:34.930" style="s2">something around Taoism and there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.160" end="00:25:37.150" style="s2">of the sense for me with Peterson that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.930" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">he&#39;s talked a lot about the West and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.150" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">Western philosophy but there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.380" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2">potential to also talk about the East do</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:43.000" style="s2">you think that&#39;s necessary do you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:45.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.000" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">East needs to come in in a new way into</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.160" end="00:25:50.710" style="s2">Western culture and the problems were</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:54.460" style="s2">facing now well absolutely I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.710" end="00:25:57.700" style="s2">something in was doing you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.460" end="00:26:02.680" style="s2">know and many poets do and people people</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.700" end="00:26:06.430" style="s2">like um Eliot you know and I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.680" end="00:26:09.070" style="s2">is a how can you ignore eastern wisdom I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.430" end="00:26:12.820" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a whole found you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.070" end="00:26:15.820" style="s2">know of fascinating ideas once you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.820" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">past you know there&#39;s rather like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.820" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">Christianity is like once you get past a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:27.970" style="s2">religious iconography and superstructure</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:30.190" style="s2">and instead of just going over this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.970" end="00:26:32.950" style="s2">all superstitious nonsense and go yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.190" end="00:26:34.450" style="s2">well what&#39;s underneath it what what are</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.950" end="00:26:37.000" style="s2">these stories trying to tell us you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.450" end="00:26:38.380" style="s2">which is exactly what Peterson is doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.000" end="00:26:39.970" style="s2">I&#39;m really what What&#39;s it saying what</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.380" end="00:26:41.770" style="s2">are these stories what does the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.970" end="00:26:45.220" style="s2">story was written what&#39;s that trying to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.770" end="00:26:47.260" style="s2">tell us actually you know and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.220" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">like you know Buddha has got all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.260" end="00:26:52.060" style="s2">answers what&#39;s good is trying to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:54.430" style="s2">and what the Buddhist tradition trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.060" end="00:26:55.810" style="s2">to tell us you know ignore all the you</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.430" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">know all the sort of you know kissing</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.810" end="00:27:00.340" style="s2">the gold Buddha - you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.910" end="00:27:02.890" style="s2">things become co-opted by religion and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.340" end="00:27:04.780" style="s2">what Watts was doing was getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.890" end="00:27:07.150" style="s2">root of Eastern religion so what does it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.780" end="00:27:08.710" style="s2">really mean and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.150" end="00:27:10.510" style="s2">Peterson has been doing and answered</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.710" end="00:27:13.540" style="s2">Western religion as well but Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.510" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">has been mainly concentrating on Western</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.540" end="00:27:18.270" style="s2">religion is what does this mean and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.740" style="s2">are these stories tell us and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.270" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s gripping to me you know and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.740" end="00:27:25.750" style="s2">they&#39;re so they&#39;re both they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:30.430" style="s2">deep delving under the surface of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.750" end="00:27:32.380" style="s2">we kind of dismissed as trivia in a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.430" end="00:27:34.630" style="s2">you know or as was said before</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.380" end="00:27:39.790" style="s2">epiphenomenon you know that they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.630" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">these stories have much more profound</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.790" end="00:27:45.250" style="s2">meanings than we understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:46.630" style="s2">interesting for me about hearing Alan</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:47.490" style="s2">Watts talk about the shadow is that in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.630" end="00:27:49.480" style="s2">his personal life</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.490" end="00:27:52.179" style="s2">you know especially in later years</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:53.880" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of talk about his own</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.179" end="00:27:57.240" style="s2">personal shadows and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.880" end="00:27:58.410" style="s2">with with alcohol for example it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.240" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">great to hear a little bit about you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.410" end="00:28:01.380" style="s2">know I wonder how much of that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">seems like a contradiction to me and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.380" end="00:28:07.169" style="s2">probably a lot of people that he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:09.960" style="s2">wise incredibly deep thinker and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.169" end="00:28:12.179" style="s2">his family life is really quite chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.960" end="00:28:13.500" style="s2">it seems compared to Peterson who seems</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.179" end="00:28:17.730" style="s2">like a different figure at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.500" end="00:28:19.980" style="s2">culturally is quite upstanding yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.730" end="00:28:23.250" style="s2">absolutely I mean he&#39;s personal life was</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.980" end="00:28:25.799" style="s2">disaster I mean he had seven children I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.250" end="00:28:28.289" style="s2">think my three wives yeah certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.799" end="00:28:31.169" style="s2">one he had four children will hated him</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.289" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">til her she died you know I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.169" end="00:28:37.250" style="s2">mean he he was a womanizer I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:43.169" style="s2">know he was that he slept around a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.250" end="00:28:44.820" style="s2">and he was a drunk and he took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.169" end="00:28:47.700" style="s2">drugs I mean there&#39;s no he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.820" end="00:28:49.230" style="s2">different Buddhism in that sense but</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.700" end="00:28:51.090" style="s2">again that&#39;s all it&#39;s time you know he</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.230" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">was he was pushing out the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.090" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2">and everyone drank in the fifties anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:58.110" style="s2">you know I mean I was pissed all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:28:59.669" style="s2">time you know so it wasn&#39;t quite but he</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:02.039" style="s2">was an alcoholic let&#39;s be honest and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.669" end="00:29:05.940" style="s2">ended up marrying an alcoholic he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.039" end="00:29:10.500" style="s2">dragged him down and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.940" end="00:29:11.970" style="s2">clearly he&#39;s relationship with you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.500" end="00:29:13.950" style="s2">who&#39;s really I mean I don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.970" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">into psychoanalyzing him but he had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.950" end="00:29:17.820" style="s2">very interesting relationship with his</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:20.100" style="s2">mother who was clearly the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.820" end="00:29:24.630" style="s2">figure in in his life and he encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.100" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">all his all his fascination in Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.630" end="00:29:28.580" style="s2">philosophy in a head sort of it started</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:32.400" style="s2">with her having all these Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.580" end="00:29:35.309" style="s2">artifacts in her home and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.400" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">was here the mother was a big figure for</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.309" end="00:29:39.570" style="s2">him I get the sense listening to both</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:41.880" style="s2">what Sam Peterson there there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.570" end="00:29:44.909" style="s2">strong performative element to what</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.880" end="00:29:47.370" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that that I think people</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.909" end="00:29:49.409" style="s2">find really compelling well they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.370" end="00:29:52.260" style="s2">got tremendous charisma you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.409" end="00:29:54.900" style="s2">mean that&#39;s so inevitably that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.260" end="00:30:00.570" style="s2">the things that attracts people to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.900" end="00:30:02.610" style="s2">but there&#39;s also so what is the nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.570" end="00:30:05.400" style="s2">of that performance well firstly in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.610" end="00:30:07.680" style="s2">the case of watts he&#39;s very funny and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.400" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">has a wonderful laugh</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.680" end="00:30:12.150" style="s2">and what&#39;s up and mr. bout peace and</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.740" end="00:31:16.890" style="s2">Peterson has got this very folksy kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.450" end="00:31:19.230" style="s2">of you know Canadian he does a very good</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.890" end="00:31:20.520" style="s2">Kermit impersonation I think I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.230" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">think it sounds like a camera unless he</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.520" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">wants to sound like Kermit bit son but</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:27.690" style="s2">he has he has that sort of real</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.760" end="00:31:36.210" style="s2">you know I think because all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.260" end="00:31:39.570" style="s2">because I think they both really have</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.210" end="00:31:42.980" style="s2">thought through to the very root what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.570" end="00:31:45.180" style="s2">is they&#39;re saying so they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.980" end="00:31:46.950" style="s2">careful with what they&#39;re saying it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.180" end="00:31:49.880" style="s2">a tremendous power because so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.950" end="00:31:52.200" style="s2">people you hear talking and signing</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.880" end="00:31:54.030" style="s2">extremely clever but when you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.200" end="00:31:56.250" style="s2">about it actually what the hell were you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.030" end="00:31:58.560" style="s2">talking about you know and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.250" end="00:32:00.090" style="s2">I mean I feel that about I won&#39;t name</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.560" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">names but you know there are there are a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.090" end="00:32:04.170" style="s2">number of psychologists and thinkers you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:05.460" style="s2">know and I&#39;ll sit and listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.170" end="00:32:07.140" style="s2">talk I think that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.460" end="00:32:09.270" style="s2">then I&#39;ll think about a bit more thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.140" end="00:32:10.740" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not really interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.270" end="00:32:12.270" style="s2">know what you&#39;ve been saying there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.740" end="00:32:14.670" style="s2">something that sounds like something</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.270" end="00:32:17.370" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting but actually when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.670" end="00:32:19.490" style="s2">really examine it it&#39;s quite hollow you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.370" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">know and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.490" end="00:32:24.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of posturing to it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:26.360" style="s2">know because there&#39;s no real deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.049" end="00:32:28.690" style="s2">knowledge underneath it and when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.360" end="00:32:32.419" style="s2">come to Peterson and what so I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.690" end="00:32:34.610" style="s2">towering figures in their way you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.419" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">you can talk about you know Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.610" end="00:32:40.179" style="s2">Jung being towering figures of nature</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.990" style="s2">being towering figure and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.179" end="00:32:43.850" style="s2">trouble is that most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.990" end="00:32:46.370" style="s2">understand them you know and don&#39;t read</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:55.640" style="s2">for an average you know consumer of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.940" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">information and what what would Pierson</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.640" end="00:33:02.470" style="s2">watts provide is is a wonderful conduit</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:06.649" style="s2">interesting and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.490" end="00:33:08.539" style="s2">interesting about Peterson and what&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.649" end="00:33:11.779" style="s2">well is that because they&#39;re Mavericks</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.539" end="00:33:14.570" style="s2">you know what&#39;s was always divided in in</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.570" end="00:33:20.140" style="s2">Cambridge Univ a just thought he was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.100" end="00:33:22.610" style="s2">joke because he because he was very</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.140" end="00:33:23.929" style="s2">understandable you know and people and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.610" end="00:33:25.460" style="s2">everybody understood what he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.929" end="00:33:25.940" style="s2">and they really didn&#39;t like that very</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.460" end="00:33:28.909" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.940" end="00:33:31.669" style="s2">you know what and likewise Pearson is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.909" end="00:33:34.940" style="s2">ostracized by many of the at the academy</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.669" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">just as well as sports I mean Moss demon</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.940" end="00:33:37.970" style="s2">it didn&#39;t even get a degree in the end I</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">don&#39;t think you know they were outside</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.970" end="00:33:43.370" style="s2">us and outside has always had the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:46.309" style="s2">interesting take somehow you know but</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.370" end="00:33:48.950" style="s2">but but Peterson to is being you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.309" end="00:33:52.100" style="s2">his own colleagues are sort of disowning</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.950" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">him because he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t sign</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.100" end="00:33:58.190" style="s2">up to their you know their articles of</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">faith and lots was exactly the same he</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.190" end="00:34:02.059" style="s2">didn&#39;t sign up to their articles of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:03.710" style="s2">faith and thought they were quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.059" end="00:34:04.820" style="s2">shallow and I was they didn&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.710" end="00:34:08.659" style="s2">that very much</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.820" end="00:34:10.849" style="s2">so Tim just to close we&#39;ve talked to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.659" end="00:34:11.990" style="s2">before about Jordan Peterson so I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.849" end="00:34:14.629" style="s2">to take the opportunity to ask about</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.990" end="00:34:16.490" style="s2">Alan Watts just in particular so</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.629" end="00:34:19.339" style="s2">Peterson has had a huge impact on people</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.490" end="00:34:22.250" style="s2">in this kind of post truth radical</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.339" end="00:34:25.220" style="s2">relativist world changing the way people</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.250" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">view themselves and their lives what do</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.220" end="00:34:29.000" style="s2">you think Watts</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:29.859" style="s2">can bring right now to to that same</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.000" end="00:34:33.029" style="s2">audience look</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.859" end="00:34:35.710" style="s2">for meaning looking for some direction</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.029" end="00:34:43.450" style="s2">well I think know what what springs to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.710" end="00:34:45.819" style="s2">it is it&#39;s partly that&#39;s in a strange</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.450" end="00:34:49.629" style="s2">way and it is it is slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.819" end="00:34:51.190" style="s2">from what Peters and his sank he was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.629" end="00:34:53.769" style="s2">great believer in this sort of law of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.190" end="00:34:58.059" style="s2">the law of sort of reverse I think he</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.769" end="00:35:00.970" style="s2">called it the reverse principle you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.059" end="00:35:02.589" style="s2">it is that the more you try the more you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.970" end="00:35:04.269" style="s2">fail the more you look for something</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.589" end="00:35:05.950" style="s2">then what you fail to find it you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.269" end="00:35:09.039" style="s2">which is sort of slightly different from</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.950" end="00:35:11.289" style="s2">Peters and he&#39;s you know he was and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.039" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">what what I think he&#39;s got to offers is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.289" end="00:35:26.140" style="s2">this kind of willfulness towards always</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:29.289" style="s2">living in and they do have something in</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.140" end="00:35:31.029" style="s2">common here actually they dislike this</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.289" end="00:35:35.489" style="s2">willfulness towards living in the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.029" end="00:35:35.489" style="s2">you know and that we that our whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.849" end="00:35:44.259" style="s2">project is about arriving at some</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.200" end="00:35:48.730" style="s2">hypothetical future and and that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.259" end="00:35:50.529" style="s2">know when you get to that future you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.730" end="00:35:52.539" style="s2">just be thinking of another future so</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.529" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">you&#39;ll never get there you know and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.539" end="00:35:58.109" style="s2">a nuts I think in this sort of late</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:36:03.220" style="s2">capitalist hyper competitive society</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.109" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">that idea you know very simple and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.220" end="00:36:06.249" style="s2">increasingly popular idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:09.789" style="s2">if you think about the future all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.249" end="00:36:11.019" style="s2">time you&#39;ll never get there and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.789" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">would think well that&#39;s not Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.019" end="00:36:16.029" style="s2">however Pearson also talks about this he</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.769" style="s2">talks about he talks about the Sermon on</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.029" end="00:36:21.130" style="s2">the Mount himself he talks about what</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.769" end="00:36:23.380" style="s2">the proper what the proper unit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.130" end="00:36:25.690" style="s2">thinking about the world is and he also</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.380" end="00:36:27.789" style="s2">talks about that consider the lilies of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.690" end="00:36:30.130" style="s2">the field interestingly instead the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.789" end="00:36:32.829" style="s2">proper unit for thinking about is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.130" end="00:36:34.599" style="s2">day you know so it&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.829" end="00:36:37.210" style="s2">constantly making I mean yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.599" end="00:36:40.010" style="s2">important to have a goal but you know he</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.210" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">oddly enough does he does</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.010" end="00:36:45.260" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:49.010" style="s2">have a conjoining with with what&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.260" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">you know and and as I told you he said I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.010" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">have to think about the day and he does</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:55.580" style="s2">he does now I&#39;m not quite sure how you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">marry that up you know the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.580" end="00:36:58.820" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to have this grand goal and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:36:59.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve got think about the day and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.820" end="00:37:02.780" style="s2">not sure Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.980" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">you know he&#39;s doubtless be out some</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.780" end="00:37:06.560" style="s2">seamlessly stitch it together but I you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:11.360" style="s2">know I can&#39;t quite work out how those</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.560" end="00:37:12.950" style="s2">two things coexist but it&#39;s he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.360" end="00:37:17.930" style="s2">aware of that you know he&#39;s very aware</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.950" end="00:37:20.690" style="s2">that people gets he&#39;s very suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.930" end="00:37:23.570" style="s2">the grand plan you know and certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.690" end="00:37:25.730" style="s2">terms of the Marxist idea of the grand</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.570" end="00:37:28.130" style="s2">plan that you know if you if you set</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:30.440" style="s2">this vision of idea this ideal vision</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.130" end="00:37:33.530" style="s2">ahead of you you know you will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.440" end="00:37:35.870" style="s2">rewarded with a heaven on earth you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.530" end="00:37:37.760" style="s2">and he&#39;s very he&#39;s very suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.870" end="00:37:41.420" style="s2">that obviously you know so the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:45.380" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of place you can get</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.420" end="00:37:51.820" style="s2">to so here&#39;s so pizzas vision is much</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.380" end="00:38:00.290" style="s2">more about you know taking</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.820" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">responsibility for yourself but but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.290" end="00:38:05.590" style="s2">think he would be very careful in how he</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:07.670" style="s2">defined responsibility and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.590" end="00:38:09.770" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean everything&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.670" end="00:38:11.030" style="s2">fault you know and and I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.770" end="00:38:12.710" style="s2">know I think I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.030" end="00:38:16.010" style="s2">what was very concerned was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.710" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">like it was a very guilt ridden society</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.010" end="00:38:20.060" style="s2">the society that he was teaching it in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:23.330" style="s2">he was and that&#39;s something that the Zen</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.060" end="00:38:25.310" style="s2">itself was created really to remove the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.330" end="00:38:28.340" style="s2">guilt of Japanese society when everybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.310" end="00:38:30.200" style="s2">was worrying about if they gave you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.340" end="00:38:32.180" style="s2">a beautiful box to their neighbors for</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:33.560" style="s2">dinner or how much they give back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.180" end="00:38:37.580" style="s2">they know this whole highly ritualized</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.560" end="00:38:40.690" style="s2">Society or whole idea of removing their</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.580" end="00:38:47.170" style="s2">anxiety you know and Watts was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.690" end="00:38:47.170" style="s2">involved with us and yeah Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:38:58.290" style="s2">Pisan inflex on these central ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.060" end="00:39:00.660" style="s2">somehow in my mind and I can&#39;t prove it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.290" end="00:39:03.060" style="s2">to you that if you if you follow them</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.660" end="00:39:06.750" style="s2">through to the end I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.060" end="00:39:10.110" style="s2">probably serving the same fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.750" end="00:39:12.770" style="s2">truth perfect place to end Tim thank you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.110" end="00:39:12.770" style="s2">very much thank you</p>
