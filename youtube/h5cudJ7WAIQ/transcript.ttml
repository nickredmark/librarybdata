<p begin="00:20:03.020" end="00:20:09.590" style="s2">through yoga a very similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:13.140" style="s2">of putting yourself in a stressful</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.590" end="00:20:15.900" style="s2">physical situation be a you know a bend</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.800" end="00:20:27.000" style="s2">how to breathe through the stress and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.150" end="00:20:29.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually found that yoga translates</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">and you have to take a deep breath and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.090" end="00:20:46.140" style="s2">exhale and like really just clear your</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">mind and just something that we need to</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.380" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">significant because it I mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.900" end="00:21:25.410" style="s2">this freakin blog post and it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.650" end="00:21:41.070" style="s2">created this situation where the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.660" end="00:21:45.110" style="s2">only kind of safe thing if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.070" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">accused of being you know an abuser or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.110" end="00:21:50.250" style="s2">monster or whatever the only safe thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:53.040" style="s2">is to say well I&#39;m a victim - mm-hmm you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.250" end="00:21:56.220" style="s2">know you know and you see this all the</p>

<p begin="00:21:59.580" end="00:22:04.560" style="s2">abused you know and and we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:06.510" style="s2">just you know my victimhood Trump&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.560" end="00:22:09.930" style="s2">victimhood Trump&#39;s your victimhood and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.510" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">it just goes on and on and on and I you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.930" end="00:22:14.490" style="s2">know as a therapist I mean you know when</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:17.660" style="s2">I work with people you know who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.490" end="00:22:20.430" style="s2">suffered traumas and and victim a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.660" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2">experiences and everything else the job</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.430" end="00:22:27.930" style="s2">is learning how to define your life</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.100" end="00:22:31.680" style="s2">differently the job is learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.930" end="00:22:34.530" style="s2">say that experience happened to me but</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.680" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">is not me</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.530" end="00:22:38.340" style="s2">and again I mean I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:40.920" style="s2">one of the things that we learned kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.340" end="00:22:45.870" style="s2">of you know in life and jujitsu and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.920" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">whatever is is you know I I can survive</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:50.130" style="s2">this and unfortunately that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:53.430" style="s2">one of the messages in all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.130" end="00:22:55.080" style="s2">victim culture that that I really worry</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.430" end="00:22:59.940" style="s2">about because when we tell people that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.080" end="00:23:01.800" style="s2">your identity is as a victim that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.940" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">becomes all that they are it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.800" end="00:23:05.400" style="s2">currency as well yeah because your</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:07.950" style="s2">currency in life and then and then there</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.400" end="00:23:09.460" style="s2">becomes a competition yeah whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.950" end="00:23:12.460" style="s2">purposeful or not it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.460" end="00:23:15.789" style="s2">tends to happen where people people find</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.460" end="00:23:19.950" style="s2">their place in a status hierarchy based</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.789" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">on their relative victimhood and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.950" end="00:23:24.669" style="s2">really a few years ago I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:27.309" style="s2">learning about this and and especially</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.669" end="00:23:29.350" style="s2">Jonathan he hates article in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.309" end="00:23:31.299" style="s2">Atlantic in 2015 called the coddling</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.350" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">American mind and where he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.299" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">the transition America has made from an</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:39.370" style="s2">honor culture to a victim culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.320" style="s2">you know my first instinct was to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.370" end="00:23:42.850" style="s2">that this is this is bullshit this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.320" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">really happening but like every data</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.850" end="00:23:47.230" style="s2">point that I get every experience that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:49.510" style="s2">have every anecdote that I have every</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.230" end="00:23:51.789" style="s2">expert that I talk to is just confirming</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.510" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">it all along the way and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.789" end="00:23:56.710" style="s2">starting to scare me because that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.520" end="00:24:03.539" style="s2">concerned about what&#39;s gonna happen when</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.110" end="00:24:06.429" style="s2">these people matriculate into</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.539" end="00:24:08.620" style="s2">professional world and into their 30s</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.980" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">much as we really kind of think that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:10.510" style="s2">can and so I think that you know we got</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:11.920" style="s2">this blip right now and and and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.510" end="00:27:14.350" style="s2">ways I think it&#39;s good I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.920" end="00:27:17.290" style="s2">the more we can move to you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.350" end="00:27:20.470" style="s2">a non-judgmental non shaming kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.290" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">approaches the better especially around</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.470" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">issues like around gender and sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:28.210" style="s2">but I but I also kind of think that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:33.020" style="s2">know people are people in humans or</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.210" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">humans and this stuff is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.020" end="00:27:39.270" style="s2">the wave is gonna crest and and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:42.270" style="s2">people are gonna come out of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.270" end="00:27:45.420" style="s2">interesting I&#39;ve often wondered to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.270" end="00:27:49.830" style="s2">extent there&#39;s gonna be variability and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.420" end="00:27:51.450" style="s2">behaviors versus variability in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.830" end="00:27:52.920" style="s2">communication about those behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.450" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">I think that you really nailed it there</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.920" end="00:27:57.330" style="s2">when you said that you know maybe our</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:59.700" style="s2">parents behaviors were just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.330" end="00:28:01.290" style="s2">more you know well well hidden and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.700" end="00:28:02.970" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a trend these days to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.290" end="00:28:05.850" style="s2">be much more public about your sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.970" end="00:28:07.500" style="s2">about your gender ideas about how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.850" end="00:28:10.290" style="s2">living your life your private life in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.500" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">the bedroom and whatnot and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.290" end="00:28:15.000" style="s2">the circles that I run in I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:18.030" style="s2">probably the most sex positive guy</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.000" end="00:28:21.030" style="s2">that&#39;s out there writing in my sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.030" end="00:28:22.710" style="s2">sphere on the internet and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.030" end="00:28:26.070" style="s2">definitely been I think that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.710" end="00:28:27.780" style="s2">met right it may it may have been but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.070" end="00:28:29.850" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember exactly to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.780" end="00:28:32.120" style="s2">honest but you know we definitely cross</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.850" end="00:28:36.630" style="s2">paths on Twitter and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.120" end="00:28:40.470" style="s2">sexuality and and masculinity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.630" end="00:28:43.350" style="s2">it&#39;s been an experience for me to be in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.470" end="00:28:45.720" style="s2">this world that&#39;s like sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.350" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">combination of like traditional mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.720" end="00:28:50.760" style="s2">but also like pick up and game and red</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">pill philosophies and like and like how</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.760" end="00:28:55.710" style="s2">people are squaring all those things and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">and squaring like notions of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.710" end="00:28:59.250" style="s2">guys you know seeking out multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:00.990" style="s2">partners and women seeking the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.250" end="00:29:04.230" style="s2">partner and like how we&#39;re squaring that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.990" end="00:29:05.700" style="s2">with modern relationships and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.230" end="00:29:08.040" style="s2">think to the extent that we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.700" end="00:29:09.720" style="s2">about things more openly and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.040" end="00:29:11.310" style="s2">honestly I think it&#39;s better for</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.720" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">everybody and we&#39;ll have everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.310" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">sort of make their own choices and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:17.880" style="s2">know my conversation with Jeffrey Miller</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:20.790" style="s2">was very much on the same vein in terms</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.880" end="00:29:23.550" style="s2">of sort of being an accepting of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.790" end="00:29:25.740" style="s2">people&#39;s lifestyle choices but you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.550" end="00:29:27.290" style="s2">also then you know being highly critical</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.740" end="00:29:29.400" style="s2">of people who are critical of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.290" end="00:29:30.750" style="s2">lifestyle choices at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.400" end="00:29:33.060" style="s2">whether it&#39;s you know coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.750" end="00:29:34.740" style="s2">right or the left or whatnot you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.060" end="00:29:37.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been somebody that believes</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.740" end="00:29:39.210" style="s2">and live and let live and as long as</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.140" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing is in harming Mir</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.210" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:43.169" style="s2">one else and I don&#39;t really give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.039" end="00:29:44.940" style="s2">what you do right and you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.169" end="00:29:46.500" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s some of that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.940" end="00:29:47.820" style="s2">really really missing today</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.500" end="00:29:49.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.820" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">transition into what I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.799" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">about today with you beyond the combat</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:56.760" style="s2">sport stuff which we really really have</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.990" end="00:29:58.890" style="s2">in common tonight and again I just want</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.760" end="00:30:00.299" style="s2">to hammer home for guys that like when</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.890" end="00:30:01.710" style="s2">you&#39;re really trying to get your life</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.299" end="00:30:04.020" style="s2">together and you&#39;re really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.710" end="00:30:05.880" style="s2">find a way to build your inner strength</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.020" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">and your confidence and again I always</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.880" end="00:30:10.590" style="s2">stress this element of building</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">community you know there&#39;s no better way</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.590" end="00:30:14.309" style="s2">in my mind then going out and joining a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">gym getting your ass in shape getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.309" end="00:30:17.250" style="s2">your ass kicked a couple times</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:19.260" style="s2">eventually finding some new white belt</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.250" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2">fishes that you can eat up and stomp and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.260" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">then finding your way up the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.240" end="00:30:24.919" style="s2">and making great friends along the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:29.780" style="s2">so I will constantly be pitching that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.919" end="00:30:35.340" style="s2">but in my sort of men&#39;s community online</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.780" end="00:30:40.400" style="s2">there is a tendency for people to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.340" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">that pornography and masturbation are</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.400" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">detrimental to man&#39;s personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:49.830" style="s2">development both personally and then in</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:51.809" style="s2">their relationships and there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.830" end="00:30:53.700" style="s2">this is November something or other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.809" end="00:30:55.470" style="s2">Election Day that we&#39;re doing this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.700" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">missing out on the midterm run down</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.470" end="00:31:00.450" style="s2">where we are using this as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:02.549" style="s2">avoid Washington right well you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.450" end="00:31:04.409" style="s2">David David and I are definitely on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.549" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">on the other side of the aisle from each</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.409" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">other but either either way we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:12.570" style="s2">sort of avoiding the election stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:14.190" style="s2">right now but the there the people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.570" end="00:31:18.169" style="s2">been talking about November being a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.190" end="00:31:21.390" style="s2">nofap November hey no no no masturbation</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.169" end="00:31:23.429" style="s2">November and as apparently they really</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.560" end="00:33:38.010" style="s2">interesting thing was that I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.750" end="00:33:44.760" style="s2">reason I was able to work with those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.010" end="00:33:46.800" style="s2">guys was because I went at them with</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.760" end="00:33:49.470" style="s2">kind of a non-judgmental approach</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.800" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">they&#39;re human I&#39;m human let&#39;s figure out</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.470" end="00:33:58.170" style="s2">and and the more we removed kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:34:00.350" style="s2">shame and stigma the more they were able</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.170" end="00:34:01.850" style="s2">to be healthy and safe and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.350" end="00:34:04.070" style="s2">you know that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:05.809" style="s2">very clear the more we stigmatize and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.070" end="00:34:09.560" style="s2">shame and isolate you know people like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.809" end="00:34:13.730" style="s2">pedophiles the worse they get right well</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.560" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s not you know associate</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.730" end="00:34:17.179" style="s2">this conversation that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">have here with like normal normal normal</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.179" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">male healthy behavior with with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">clearly technically deviant behavior</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:25.490" style="s2">right so we&#39;re not talking about deviant</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:29.060" style="s2">behavior we&#39;re talking about a twenty</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.490" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">five year old guy who who is at home on</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.060" end="00:34:33.169" style="s2">a Friday night he&#39;s jerking off and see</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that guy got referred</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.169" end="00:34:37.850" style="s2">to me because ninety five percent of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:40.340" style="s2">therapists in the United States have no</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.850" end="00:34:42.409" style="s2">training in sexuality no training is</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.340" end="00:34:45.230" style="s2">mind-boggling no training that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.409" end="00:34:47.480" style="s2">all sexual beings yeah I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.230" end="00:34:49.909" style="s2">Kinsey said it best at a definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.480" end="00:34:52.220" style="s2">nymphomaniac or a sex addict or deviant</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.909" end="00:34:55.909" style="s2">is anybody who has more sex or different</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.220" end="00:34:57.890" style="s2">sex and then the therapist and and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.909" end="00:34:59.840" style="s2">the problem is that you know most</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.890" end="00:35:03.940" style="s2">therapists at this one is is a largely</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.840" end="00:35:06.770" style="s2">female driven field and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.940" end="00:35:09.710" style="s2">they get no training in sexuality and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.770" end="00:35:12.260" style="s2">they judge you know your sexuality if</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.710" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">you if you endorse it or identified in</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.260" end="00:35:17.000" style="s2">therapy they judge it based on whether</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:20.510" style="s2">they would do it or not right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.000" end="00:35:23.780" style="s2">they&#39;re not men so they wouldn&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.510" end="00:35:26.000" style="s2">and so and so you know they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.780" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">aware of their bias and and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:30.710" style="s2">difference in female and male attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:32.180" style="s2">and so very normal you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.710" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">sexual behaviors were getting referred</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.180" end="00:35:38.450" style="s2">to me as as kind of deviant and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.090" end="00:35:40.100" style="s2">going to give me an example oh Jesus I</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.450" end="00:35:41.630" style="s2">mean this one you know 18 year old guy</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.570" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">around pornography because what</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.950" end="00:37:57.830" style="s2">pornography does is pornography offers</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:01.160" style="s2">an outlet largely to men but to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.830" end="00:38:07.070" style="s2">increasing numbers of women to enjoy or</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.940" end="00:38:27.640" style="s2">anti-porn person but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">she and I in a battle often but when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.640" end="00:38:33.549" style="s2">think she said one time was that she</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:37.329" style="s2">said you know sex workers are the scabs</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.549" end="00:38:39.640" style="s2">of feminism no ma&#39;am and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.329" end="00:38:42.039" style="s2">really powerful thing because a scab is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.640" end="00:38:45.039" style="s2">somebody who undercuts the price right</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.039" end="00:38:49.569" style="s2">right and so what she&#39;s saying is that</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.119" end="00:39:01.569" style="s2">because nobody will buy the cow right</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.530" end="00:39:04.299" style="s2">because because female sexuality is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.569" end="00:39:06.849" style="s2">cartel that&#39;s right and pornography and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.299" end="00:39:08.890" style="s2">internet pornography puts high speed you</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.819" end="00:43:21.729" style="s2">something that you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.109" end="00:43:27.309" style="s2">earlier which was that pornography</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.729" end="00:43:32.900" style="s2">brings a sexual experience to two people</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.309" end="00:43:35.239" style="s2">without the labor or effort previously</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.900" end="00:43:38.359" style="s2">required now I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.239" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">actually the crux of the argument with</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.359" end="00:43:44.059" style="s2">since sort of my community against</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:45.890" style="s2">pornography in that if you&#39;re a guy that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.059" end="00:43:47.809" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a satisfying female</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.890" end="00:43:49.069" style="s2">relationship and you&#39;re heterosexual if</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.279" end="00:43:55.339" style="s2">frequently you&#39;re getting laid or having</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.259" end="00:43:58.819" style="s2">a loved and committing intimate</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.339" end="00:44:01.099" style="s2">relationship that it takes practice and</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.819" end="00:44:03.289" style="s2">it takes effort and it takes getting out</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.099" end="00:44:06.249" style="s2">in there in the field and and winning or</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.289" end="00:44:08.989" style="s2">losing and trial and error and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.249" end="00:44:13.729" style="s2">masturbating to pornography is though is</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.989" end="00:44:15.829" style="s2">a way to it&#39;s like a short circuit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.729" end="00:44:17.799" style="s2">like a it&#39;s like a shortcut to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.829" end="00:44:21.679" style="s2">release the pleasure of the release</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.799" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">which is in the end not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.679" end="00:44:25.999" style="s2">fulfilling as a long-term intimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:30.769" style="s2">sexual relationship and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.999" end="00:44:35.109" style="s2">what people will say is that to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.769" end="00:44:37.050" style="s2">build-up and the urge and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.109" end="00:44:40.440" style="s2">testosterone and</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.030" end="00:44:52.680" style="s2">masturbating to pornography in</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.650" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">particular sort of takes away some of</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.859" end="00:53:32.200" style="s2">all these things conflated and so in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.410" end="00:53:35.349" style="s2">your mind like when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.200" end="00:53:38.020" style="s2">visualizing this fantasy whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.349" end="00:53:40.299" style="s2">with your eyes closed or whether with</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.020" end="00:53:42.099" style="s2">your eyes open is there a difference is</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.299" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">there is there some somehow that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.650" end="00:53:56.109" style="s2">um I so one of the things that that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.529" end="00:53:57.369" style="s2">possibly going on here and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.109" end="00:54:00.430" style="s2">I&#39;m enough of a scientist and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.369" end="00:54:02.140" style="s2">psychologist to say you know anything is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.430" end="00:54:03.819" style="s2">possible and and here&#39;s what I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.140" end="00:54:08.010" style="s2">could be going on but I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.819" end="00:54:11.230" style="s2">change my opinion based on data yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.010" end="00:54:13.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s where that&#39;s where you need</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.230" end="00:54:15.369" style="s2">to be skeptical if you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.059" end="00:54:17.950" style="s2">somebody or listening to somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.369" end="00:54:20.349" style="s2">telling you that they know by god they</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.950" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">know they are 100 percent certain that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.349" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening you need to run</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:29.789" style="s2">like a run like a chicken because they</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">they are trying to sell you shit and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.789" end="00:54:33.640" style="s2">because you know nothing in this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:36.460" style="s2">is certain everything is developing</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.640" end="00:54:38.170" style="s2">there&#39;s so much we don&#39;t know so one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.460" end="00:54:42.089" style="s2">the things that might be going on is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.170" end="00:54:45.400" style="s2">that you know pornography offers the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.089" end="00:54:48.250" style="s2">ability to masturbate to sexual fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.400" end="00:54:50.200" style="s2">made external you know if pornography is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.250" end="00:54:53.079" style="s2">nothing more nothing less than our</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.200" end="00:54:55.930" style="s2">sexual fantasies made visible on video</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.079" end="00:54:58.569" style="s2">and now would you I think somebody might</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.930" end="00:55:02.069" style="s2">argue that it&#39;s actually working the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.569" end="00:55:04.329" style="s2">other way in that the the variety of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.069" end="00:55:06.900" style="s2">pornographer graphic material is</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.329" end="00:55:09.430" style="s2">actually influencing people&#39;s fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.900" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">what&#39;s probably leading to is actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.430" end="00:55:14.710" style="s2">diminishing of fantasies is that because</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:16.599" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t have to fantasize you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.710" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have to work in your own brain to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.599" end="00:55:23.349" style="s2">get turned on you just turn on the porn</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:25.150" style="s2">now the question is what if there was no</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.349" end="00:55:27.160" style="s2">porn you know all of a sudden if the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.150" end="00:55:29.309" style="s2">internet ended you know if you were all</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.160" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">of a sudden stuck on a deserted island</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.309" end="00:55:35.320" style="s2">and you had all the coconut oil you want</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:37.120" style="s2">to porn</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.320" end="00:55:39.850" style="s2">you know and you&#39;ve been jerking off you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.120" end="00:55:41.350" style="s2">know I know a guy who has never I know</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.850" end="00:55:43.780" style="s2">many guys actually who have never</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.350" end="00:55:46.210" style="s2">masturbated in their entire lives</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.780" end="00:55:47.500" style="s2">without pornography this one dude he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.210" end="00:55:50.230" style="s2">an artist and if he couldn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.500" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">pornography he would draw a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.230" end="00:55:55.000" style="s2">naked woman and then jerk off to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:57.220" style="s2">which is brilliant and creative now if</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.000" end="00:56:00.040" style="s2">that guy was stuck on a deserted island</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.220" end="00:56:02.380" style="s2">you know would he be able to create</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.040" end="00:56:04.540" style="s2">fantasies in his own mind again I</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.380" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">believe in the resiliency of people and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.540" end="00:56:10.180" style="s2">I think at a time he probably would</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:11.950" style="s2">right so what what maybe is happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.180" end="00:56:14.860" style="s2">right now is that pornography is leading</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.950" end="00:56:17.860" style="s2">to people kind of diminishing their own</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.860" end="00:56:19.900" style="s2">creative sexual fantasies and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.860" end="00:56:21.730" style="s2">just kind of adopting or accepting the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.900" end="00:56:25.180" style="s2">sexual fantasies that are present in</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.730" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">pornography but we but we kind of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.180" end="00:56:30.910" style="s2">know yeah and while we don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:32.980" style="s2">think we we need to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.910" end="00:56:35.010" style="s2">cautious now one of the other things is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.980" end="00:56:37.360" style="s2">that you know there is this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.010" end="00:56:39.250" style="s2">myth there&#39;s this there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.360" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">you know modern sort of approach that oh</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.909" end="00:58:01.229" style="s2">porn you know the kind of porn I watch I</p>

<p begin="00:58:03.209" end="00:58:07.229" style="s2">the early 1900&#39;s which is some of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.309" end="00:58:11.189" style="s2">dirty Samantha you&#39;re gonna say seven</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.229" end="00:58:12.659" style="s2">seventy that&#39;s when I grew up man with</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.189" end="00:58:15.239" style="s2">all the with all the pubic area I love</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.659" end="00:58:18.539" style="s2">it well I think that that an argument</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.239" end="00:58:22.709" style="s2">that people make is that pornography is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.539" end="00:58:24.029" style="s2">like you know compelling women to behave</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.709" end="00:58:29.759" style="s2">in ways that they wouldn&#39;t ordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.029" end="00:58:32.399" style="s2">behave I think that obviously based on</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.759" end="00:58:34.709" style="s2">these spectrograph and based on you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.399" end="00:58:37.409" style="s2">just what I know about women&#39;s sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.709" end="00:58:40.139" style="s2">through my greater than statistically</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.409" end="00:58:43.049" style="s2">relevant sample size is that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.139" end="00:58:45.059" style="s2">absolutely fucking horseshit so well so</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.049" end="00:58:47.699" style="s2">I&#39;ll say two things there you know first</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.059" end="00:58:49.769" style="s2">the interesting thing about the history</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.699" end="00:58:52.259" style="s2">of pornography is that it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.769" end="00:58:55.979" style="s2">historically only accessible to wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.259" end="00:58:57.989" style="s2">men and so that&#39;s where that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.979" end="00:58:58.559" style="s2">things start changing now is that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.989" end="00:59:01.949" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.559" end="00:59:04.109" style="s2">the Internet has democratized access to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.949" end="00:59:06.419" style="s2">information about sexuality and sexual</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.109" end="00:59:08.939" style="s2">material to people who did not use to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.419" end="00:59:12.509" style="s2">have access to it women and poor people</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.939" end="00:59:14.699" style="s2">and and I think that&#39;s really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.509" end="00:59:18.359" style="s2">and I also think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.699" end="00:59:22.289" style="s2">reasons why when you look at most of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.359" end="00:59:23.969" style="s2">bodies who are actively resisting you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.289" end="00:59:26.939" style="s2">know pornography and identifying it as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.969" end="00:59:28.979" style="s2">scourge they are largely these</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.939" end="00:59:32.189" style="s2">conservative wealthy institutions who</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.979" end="00:59:33.779" style="s2">want you to be afraid of sex and they</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.189" end="00:59:38.789" style="s2">don&#39;t want you to have information or</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.779" end="00:59:41.729" style="s2">access to it right and so they know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.789" end="00:59:44.519" style="s2">other thing is that a you know women are</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.729" end="00:59:46.979" style="s2">accessing you know erotic material and</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.519" end="00:59:50.099" style="s2">pornography online more than ever before</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.979" end="00:59:53.039" style="s2">and what is what I find really really</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.099" end="00:59:55.469" style="s2">interesting is that you know when women</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.039" end="00:59:57.059" style="s2">access pornography they do so in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.469" end="01:00:02.090" style="s2">little bit of a different way than men</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.059" end="01:00:04.700" style="s2">their predominant sex</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.090" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">simulated rape porn at three times the</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.520" end="01:00:12.050" style="s2">sure yes so so when you know anti-porn</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.430" end="01:00:14.390" style="s2">activists and such are saying that oh my</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.050" end="01:00:16.340" style="s2">god you know we we need to get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.390" end="01:00:19.730" style="s2">you know pourings is causing them in to</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.340" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">rape well actually it appears to be an</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.730" end="01:00:23.150" style="s2">outlet for women who have that fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:25.670" style="s2">and don&#39;t have access to it in their</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.150" end="01:00:26.990" style="s2">life right well you know again going</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.670" end="01:00:28.730" style="s2">back to some of my older writing I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.990" end="01:00:31.250" style="s2">I certainly addressed this issue the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.730" end="01:00:32.840" style="s2">women having rape fantasies and you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.250" end="01:00:34.430" style="s2">anybody that&#39;s making an argument that</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.840" end="01:00:36.680" style="s2">the availability of pornography is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.430" end="01:00:38.600" style="s2">leading to a prevalence and rape has not</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.680" end="01:00:40.460" style="s2">looked at the charts and the mobile top</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.600" end="01:00:41.900" style="s2">of each other rates of rates of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.460" end="01:00:43.700" style="s2">violence go down with access to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.900" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">pornography pornography is good for</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.700" end="01:00:49.610" style="s2">society feminists feminists should want</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:53.480" style="s2">more porn and in fact men who watch more</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.610" end="01:00:56.060" style="s2">pornography become more egalitarian they</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.480" end="01:00:58.340" style="s2">become more feminist so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.060" end="01:01:00.380" style="s2">jack maybe maybe one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.340" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">you&#39;re all you&#39;re all right fellas don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.380" end="01:01:06.080" style="s2">know all right no I&#39;ll trace it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:08.420" style="s2">David&#39;s using that in the 24th 2014</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.080" end="01:01:11.990" style="s2">version I&#39;m old yes he&#39;s not using that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.420" end="01:01:13.960" style="s2">in the 2018 version so so it may be one</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.990" end="01:01:16.580" style="s2">of the reasons that people don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.960" end="01:01:17.870" style="s2">you know guys watching that porn is</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.580" end="01:01:19.550" style="s2">because it makes it more feminist it</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.870" end="01:01:21.710" style="s2">makes them more it makes them more</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.550" end="01:01:23.420" style="s2">accepting of female sexual empowerment</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.710" end="01:01:26.930" style="s2">well I think ironically what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.420" end="01:01:30.020" style="s2">pointed out is that people men who are</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.930" end="01:01:31.700" style="s2">anti porn are working to increase the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.020" end="01:01:34.460" style="s2">price of pussy yeah right because</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.700" end="01:01:37.340" style="s2">they&#39;re rien hansung the cartel effect</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.460" end="01:01:39.350" style="s2">and I think that feminists have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.340" end="01:01:40.820" style="s2">problem with sex workers in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.350" end="01:01:45.740" style="s2">and they have a problem with pornography</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.820" end="01:01:49.340" style="s2">in the same way because sadly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.740" end="01:01:51.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion among women that their</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.340" end="01:01:53.840" style="s2">currency is sexuality yeah and so that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.950" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what makes them valuable and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.840" end="01:01:58.040" style="s2">therefore they have to restrict access</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:02:01.960" style="s2">to it and so I experienced that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.040" end="01:02:05.300" style="s2">personally in my own marriage therapy</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.960" end="01:02:07.610" style="s2">ten years ago or more I&#39;m in Marin</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.300" end="01:02:10.280" style="s2">County you know a couples therapy and a</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.610" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">60 year old woman who&#39;s trying to advise</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.280" end="01:02:13.999" style="s2">me and my wife</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.949" style="s2">whoo my wife wasn&#39;t fucking me we</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.999" end="01:02:17.930" style="s2">weren&#39;t having any sex at all and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.949" end="01:02:19.279" style="s2">therapist is like well I really want you</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.930" end="01:02:20.359" style="s2">to examine your feelings that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.279" end="01:02:22.640" style="s2">having when you masturbate to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.359" end="01:02:24.459" style="s2">pornography and she she clarified and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.640" end="01:02:29.059" style="s2">her search she pointed it out as</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.459" end="01:02:30.229" style="s2">infidelity and my ex-wife just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.059" end="01:02:32.209" style="s2">believe it I was looking at pornography</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.229" end="01:02:33.319" style="s2">and I was turning off and it was just</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.209" end="01:02:34.759" style="s2">the worst thing that could possibly be</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.319" end="01:02:36.619" style="s2">happened and every time that I jerked</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.759" end="01:02:36.979" style="s2">off to pornography like four times a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.619" end="01:02:39.619" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.979" end="01:02:41.809" style="s2">it was a huge grave injustice place to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.619" end="01:02:43.249" style="s2">burn her and of course all that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.809" end="01:02:45.469" style="s2">complete until the horseshit</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.249" end="01:02:47.299" style="s2">but what it was was that it did nuded</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.469" end="01:02:48.380" style="s2">the power that she had by withholding</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.299" end="01:02:50.930" style="s2">sex from me</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.380" end="01:02:52.789" style="s2">and ironically when we&#39;ve got guys now</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.930" end="01:02:54.619" style="s2">who are trying to advise other guys and</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.789" end="01:02:56.059" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying is don&#39;t don&#39;t jerk</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.619" end="01:02:57.499" style="s2">off and don&#39;t look at porn what they</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.059" end="01:03:00.319" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying is is that like</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.499" end="01:03:02.809" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of elevating which is sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.319" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">of contrary to the whole ethos they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.809" end="01:03:08.930" style="s2">elevating there&#39;s access to sex to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:10.819" style="s2">higher level rather than sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.930" end="01:03:13.279" style="s2">spreading it around a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.819" end="01:03:15.739" style="s2">you know the research actually research</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.279" end="01:03:17.029" style="s2">around all this and I get in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.739" end="01:03:19.400" style="s2">because I talk about the research a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.029" end="01:03:21.140" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s the way we please</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.400" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">well that&#39;s the way we get to pull</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.140" end="01:03:25.009" style="s2">ourselves out of you know pull our head</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:26.630" style="s2">out of our ass and look at the way the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.009" end="01:03:30.289" style="s2">world is as opposed to the way we think</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.630" end="01:03:32.539" style="s2">it is you know so a guy named Regnerus</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.289" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">he&#39;s a University of Austin I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.539" end="01:03:38.390" style="s2">Texas at Austin and any published</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:40.969" style="s2">research last year showing that men and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.390" end="01:03:44.539" style="s2">women who are married used masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.969" end="01:03:48.440" style="s2">differently that men used masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.539" end="01:03:51.019" style="s2">to compensate for not having enough sex</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.440" end="01:03:53.719" style="s2">when a man is sexually unsatisfied he</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.019" end="01:03:56.719" style="s2">masturbates more frequently as sex with</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.719" end="01:03:58.940" style="s2">his wife goes down but when his yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.719" end="01:04:00.829" style="s2">when he&#39;s satisfied he continues to</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.940" end="01:04:02.449" style="s2">masturbate and the frequency of</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.829" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">masturbation has no relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.449" end="01:04:07.670" style="s2">statistically to the frequency of sex</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:12.650" style="s2">but women as women have more sex</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.670" end="01:04:14.569" style="s2">masturbation goes up women use sex used</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.650" end="01:04:16.430" style="s2">masturbation as a way to complement</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.569" end="01:04:18.140" style="s2">sexuality so the way I talk about it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.430" end="01:04:21.200" style="s2">that you know the female sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:23.599" style="s2">female libido is kind of an engine</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.200" end="01:04:26.060" style="s2">as sex within a marriage gets the engine</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.599" end="01:04:28.760" style="s2">going they use masturbation to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.060" end="01:04:30.800" style="s2">engine revving yeah so I think again we</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.760" end="01:04:33.260" style="s2">need to we need to we need to stop</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.800" end="01:04:34.670" style="s2">looking at kind of this sort of blank</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.260" end="01:04:36.589" style="s2">slate</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.670" end="01:04:38.869" style="s2">everybody&#39;s equal everybody&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.589" end="01:04:40.339" style="s2">kind of approach and recognize people</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.869" end="01:04:42.170" style="s2">are different genders are different</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.339" end="01:04:45.349" style="s2">people approach sexuality and marriage</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.170" end="01:04:48.230" style="s2">differently and now let&#39;s stop shaming</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.349" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">everybody for being different and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.230" end="01:04:51.470" style="s2">understand what those differences mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:53.300" style="s2">masturbation is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.470" end="01:04:55.010" style="s2">really teaches is a lot about that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.300" end="01:04:56.900" style="s2">well I&#39;ve found in my personal</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.010" end="01:04:59.150" style="s2">experience that there&#39;s virtually no</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.900" end="01:05:02.329" style="s2">correlation to me for masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.150" end="01:05:06.050" style="s2">versus sex sexual frequency with my</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.329" end="01:05:07.339" style="s2">partner or partners even if I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.050" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">sex twice and three times a day</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.339" end="01:05:10.369" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;ll slip one in you know it</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:13.130" style="s2">just kind of it&#39;s just kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.369" end="01:05:14.900" style="s2">thing and and but then also I can go you</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.130" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">know a couple of weeks without it so</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.900" end="01:05:20.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve personally seen no correlation in</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:23.780" style="s2">my life you know and I see guys who come</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.240" end="01:05:25.250" style="s2">to me and you know they&#39;re I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.780" end="01:05:26.930" style="s2">if you want to call them in cells or</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.250" end="01:05:28.940" style="s2">they&#39;re there guys who were concerned</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.930" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">there you&#39;re addicted to masturbation or</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.940" end="01:05:33.319" style="s2">pornography or whatever and and and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:35.990" style="s2">feel for those guys and and what I find</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.319" end="01:05:38.930" style="s2">across the board is that these these</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.990" end="01:05:41.510" style="s2">tend to be guys with higher levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.930" end="01:05:46.310" style="s2">anxiety struggles and higher levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.510" end="01:05:48.619" style="s2">kind of social struggles and as they</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.310" end="01:05:50.930" style="s2">they they actually get some benefits</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.619" end="01:05:52.880" style="s2">sometimes from buying into these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.930" end="01:05:54.849" style="s2">online you know kind of cult beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.880" end="01:05:59.260" style="s2">around pornography and masturbation</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.849" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">because when they when they stop</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.260" end="01:06:03.770" style="s2">masturbating to pornography and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:06.650" style="s2">kind of take charge of their life and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.770" end="01:06:09.619" style="s2">that I think is is the one benefit of</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.650" end="01:06:12.230" style="s2">all of this but it&#39;s accidental is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.619" end="01:06:14.000" style="s2">by these by these cults kind of saying</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.390" end="01:08:27.740" style="s2">than spending five hours watching</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.980" end="01:08:30.250" style="s2">television got it or playing video games</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.740" end="01:08:33.410" style="s2">or playing video games yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.250" end="01:08:35.150" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately Jack I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.410" end="01:08:37.759" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is that we treat</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.150" end="01:08:42.140" style="s2">sexuality as though it is this you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.759" end="01:08:47.029" style="s2">inherently uh kind of special behavior</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.140" end="01:08:48.560" style="s2">and thing in life and I&#39;m sorry but it</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.029" end="01:08:51.650" style="s2">it&#39;s no diff</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.560" end="01:08:56.450" style="s2">than any other human behavior it has the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.650" end="01:09:00.890" style="s2">value that we give to it but it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.450" end="01:09:04.040" style="s2">inherently special in the way that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.890" end="01:09:07.280" style="s2">treat it and so the psychology of it the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.040" end="01:09:10.970" style="s2">behavior of it is just like all other</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.280" end="01:09:12.740" style="s2">human behaviors you know that I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.970" end="01:09:13.940" style="s2">know when you say it&#39;s like all the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.740" end="01:09:15.319" style="s2">human behaviors but my first thought is</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.940" end="01:09:16.839" style="s2">like okay well it&#39;s like eating or</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.319" end="01:09:20.050" style="s2">sleeping or taking a shit or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.839" end="01:09:22.190" style="s2">but there&#39;s not a hormonal release or</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.050" end="01:09:26.870" style="s2">after taking a shit there&#39;s a hormone or</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.190" end="01:09:27.980" style="s2">release you know I mean if we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.870" end="01:09:31.280" style="s2">time I&#39;ll tell you about some of the</p>

<p begin="01:24:06.320" end="01:24:09.800" style="s2">power exchange it&#39;s partially because</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.180" end="01:24:11.750" style="s2">they&#39;re already living a consensual</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.800" end="01:24:12.470" style="s2">power that&#39;s interesting I thought about</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.750" end="01:24:17.090" style="s2">that that&#39;s clever</p>

<p begin="01:24:17.090" end="01:24:22.010" style="s2">way that our fantasies bubble up it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.850" end="01:24:23.570" style="s2">always about the forbidden right it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:24:35.210" end="01:24:40.250" style="s2">into that and and in my opinion gives us</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.090" end="01:24:43.970" style="s2">a healthy outlet until until you can</p>
