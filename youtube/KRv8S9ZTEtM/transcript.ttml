<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">so i thought um i start uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">with uh kind of an overview of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:04.159" style="s2">thought because i think you read the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">cultural piece i sent you the medic</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.159" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">tribes and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">and one of the themes here at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">is just holding</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">complexity and we&#39;ve had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">thinkers come in who have distinct views</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">um so i wonder if there is a john zurzan</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">101 that you can give it that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:22.000" style="s2">lot to ask but</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s my first question for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">well i focused a lot on uh what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">when a society is more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">technological</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">the whole civilization question and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">think we are now</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">pretty clearly at the point of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">all these crises converge and put into</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">things at a civilizational level</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">heart of it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">uh the rest of it is is kind of details</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">i think all of the previous</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">civilizations we&#39;ve seen have failed</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">and now there&#39;s really only one under</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">the sign of technology and capital</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s one integrated totality</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">in various cultures but really only one</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">world civilization now</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s failing spectacularly in every</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">single</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">area every level every sphere</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">name one that isn&#39;t going south and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">uh the point is well there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">points to it but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">fundamental i think we could say uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">civilization is a parasite that consumes</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">host and then the subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">versions uh seem in general</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">to have a bigger purchase because you</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">need a bigger host to consume and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">finally we get to this one which is all</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">enveloping</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing outside of it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">there&#39;s almost nothing outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a few indigenous holdouts or</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:07.599" style="s2">and uh so i mean all these various</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:10.239" style="s2">efforts to to safeguard things to reform</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">things to salvage something</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.239" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">they&#39;re really they really mean nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">they just</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">that&#39;s why so many people have thrown in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">the towel they had very very weak</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">solutions they</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">looked at things at anything but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">required depth</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">the needed to address the problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re gone i mean they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">giving up like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">you know all sorts of political types</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">too not just uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">say environmentalists but uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">people too it&#39;s just uh game over</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">really that&#39;s so you&#39;ve got to if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">as a civilizational problem then what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">obviously is to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">yes or no it&#39;s hard to say no even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">uh even if and when you&#39;ve decided it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.000" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">exactly the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what causes all this</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">starting with domestication</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">starting with that epical shift to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">the control deepens and uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">broadens and you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a continuum that&#39;s fairly easy to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.280" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">chart</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">i think paul shepard said it well when</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">he was he was sort of referring the late</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">anthropologist paul shepard referring to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:34.800" style="s2">things like nanotechnology and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">a lot of current high-tech things he</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.800" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">said it&#39;s all there at the start</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s there in the first step it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">implicit in the first step which is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">step to domestication</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">to agriculture to the domination of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">nature and it feeds on itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a progression that i think is easy</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">to spot</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">uh easy to track and then you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">place where</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">the control is total and that&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">in terms of science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">obviously in terms of say survival</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">the whole name of the game is control</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">pursue that and uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">make it stronger make it more extensive</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">and uh and here we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">and here we are with everything uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">really failing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">and the the technology part let me just</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:33.919" style="s2">go back to that for a second</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very central in so many</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.919" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">ways partly because</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">political ideology used to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">certain answers or claims or promises</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">the american dream or what have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s really it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">worthless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">very few people believe in that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">i think the promises and claims that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">technology makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">every day in all the huge ads and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">have stepped into that vacuum and now</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what is going to either help us</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">or heal us or create a brave new</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">future and i say that with some irony uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening i</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">mean in other words it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">swallow given that we have more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">and more technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">and things are getting worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">and worse for the individual for society</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">for the physical environment do you name</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">there we go it could go on and on but</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">some idea yeah yeah i want to double</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">click on the technology piece in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">moment but i was thinking it would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">prudent to come to terms um you had that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">label anarcho primitivist</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">um attached to you and in your work you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">have a dualism between</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">primitive and uh civilized where</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:07:59.800" style="s2">primitive is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">you know non-alienated wild uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.800" end="00:08:02.879" style="s2">non-hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">while civilized is um alienated</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.879" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">domesticated uh hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">uh so i was wondering if you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">expand on that concept a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">of that dualism that you have in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">well yeah i think you put it very well</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s i would say that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">accurate way to put it in the thumbnail</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">way well it&#39;s it&#39;s the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">imparted to the idea that if the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t somehow primitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">there won&#39;t be a future if we just keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">going down this suicidal road</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">uh that&#39;s that&#39;s the end of it it really</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">uh in terms of the human experience in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">boy civilization sure was great wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">it or</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">or maybe it destroyed everything it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">just a path of ruin</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">time after time and now this time as</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s a i mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">anarchists uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">some some of us who see rewilding as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">and i think that goes along with the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">perspective of some</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">native folks who see decolonization</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">i think the two can be fairly linked</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">i think some of us are pursuing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">anyway in a more in a more real</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">sense uh or in a more uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">maybe down-to-earth sense decolonization</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">maybe is easier</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">to picture or or think about or proceed</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">with than</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">rewilding because rewilding after all</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:34.000" style="s2">that means d</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">domestication we&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.000" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">i certainly am we can have these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">about domestication but</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">shedding the domestication is quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">another thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know if we&#39;re ever going</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">to do that i don&#39;t know if we&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">at all to do that to tackle that but uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the way out of this it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">to refuse all these different uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">and values that have brought us to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">uh sorry place</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">so the circle back to the technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">piece uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">you&#39;re critical on technology but also</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">on what john vicki would call</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">psychotechnologies like</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">math or the concept of time um that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">complicit in the destructiveness that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">civilization brings could you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">um speak more on that well in the 80s i</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:30.320" style="s2">wrote what turned out to be a series</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">of i guess five essays i didn&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.320" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">it as a series at the beginning of it or</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">anything but uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">what are the categories or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">of alienation in other words where does</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">all this get started</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">and i was thinking about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">time number language</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">art and agriculture to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s very speculative i mean some some</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">of the pieces more than others</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">the language one is very speculative</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">uh more so than the others but when do</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">you start seeing this estrangement</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">in other words for example let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">the concept of number</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">not numbers but number itself if you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.360" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">where did that enter human existence</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">where is the need</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">to count things to to come up with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">uh category of thinking uh number</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:29.040" style="s2">uh well it&#39;s not too hard to see the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.040" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s totally evil or uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">or horrible i</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s the start of that but uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">when do you need to count things you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s a certain stage of uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">society and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">eminently necessary with domestication</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">with private property with farming and</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the commodity and</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">every anthropology 101 will tell you</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s just a truism</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">and well time and here we are this</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">dimension that one is another example</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">we&#39;re totally colonized by time uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">myself included uh it stands over us</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">as a materiality well where did that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">where did that get started</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">where is the time consciousness there</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">are we</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">we tend to think that uh some societies</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">early well hunter-gatherer societies</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a notion of time time didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">in so far as time is a consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">and objectified uh whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">no one can quite die no one can quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">identify what that word means time</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">einstein said it&#39;s what a clock measures</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">yes but what is it that&#39;s being measured</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">you know he he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">get into that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">because it says it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s you know these things start</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">and it it strikes me it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">coincidence that the development of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">certain things uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s not a coincidence that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">they grow uh a pace they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">related to a situation and a situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">which is changing</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">and they it&#39;s a part of an adjustment to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">something and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">and a way to make that something grow</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">when it becomes the dominant order when</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">it becomes the uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">the ruling paradigm the ruling set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">structures and all that then it&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">you know the fact i think time is</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">you could say time and alienation are</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">you can you can chart one just like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">other your time consciousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">measure of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">of your estrangement your alienation</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.079" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s the stuff uh yeah that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">wrote</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.079" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">that stuff in the 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">some some originality there i guess some</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">have said i should have quit in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">i haven&#39;t come up with anything very new</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.199" style="s2">since but uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">we&#39;re all trying to contribute trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.199" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">contribute to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">dialogue that which has to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">transparent and honest if it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:47.279" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">so we&#39;ll pivot into the chats in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">moment as much questions being populated</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">and i think we kind of fleshed out a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">good um</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">architecture of your views</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">when we were exchanging over email you</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">said you had some thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">uh late stage civilization our current</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">a lot of people are saying that we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">in a meta crisis or an omni crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:14.240" style="s2">um so i&#39;m curious what is your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">on what is happening now</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.240" end="00:15:18.079" style="s2">well yeah i think that&#39;s quite accurate</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">to put it that way those are</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">those are uh words that have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">ring it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">uh it&#39;s kind of hard to miss isn&#39;t it do</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">you think there&#39;s anybody out there</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">things are going in a good direction</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">fundamentally uh or otherwise i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">it&#39;s catastrophic and it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">pace of it is accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">you know we we look at our grandkids and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">i&#39;m sure we&#39;re not the only ones that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">will wonder what kind of a world will</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">they have in</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">maybe even five years i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">not to mention the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">uh more generally speaking and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">all these pathologies that maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">uh as loudly as anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">since the late 90s for example here in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">the us</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">the mass shootings the school shootings</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s even emerging more that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">if the pandemic is lessening or</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">lightening up i don&#39;t know if it is but</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">you know there&#39;s been certain return to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">school and work and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">uh which may or may not obtain it may</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">just a remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">scary thing because it seems to me one</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">of the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">typical responses in the story about a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">shooting</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">is something like well the guy never</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:16:59.440" style="s2">missed work he never played his music</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">cloud he was very polite and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.440" end="00:17:03.759" style="s2">then he went in there and killed 20</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">people no history of mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.759" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">no criminal record just snapped</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">that is pretty damn telling and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">that is that&#39;s only one uh little slice</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">of it of course now we got rising</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">suicide rates</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">uh people are less and less healthy uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">the place is awash in the statistics</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">anxiety and depression even longevity</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">rates have started to stall</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">it used to be a bottom line answer to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">some of our thinking and people would</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">say well yeah that all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">people have never lived longer we live</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">longer and longer</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">well that&#39;s not quite so true anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">that and if you count all the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m not saying we don&#39;t count</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">them but</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:52.960" style="s2">all the people that are totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">dependent on the medical industry</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.960" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">taking half a dozen uh drugs a day to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:17:59.919" style="s2">stay alive</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">quality life is very very poor they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.919" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">still living but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">not compared to we used to be robust we</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">used to be healthy</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">and by the way speaking of longevity</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">people used to say well yeah but hunter</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">gathered in life they were all dead by</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">30.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">well that&#39;s just not true that&#39;s a comic</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">book fiction</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">like a lot of other things about uh the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">record of prehistory so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just there isn&#39;t any part of</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">interconnected or interdependent these</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">you could just read a newspaper once a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.720" style="s2">while you could see it plainly</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">this is the age of pandemics it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.720" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">questions um</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">the one on population uh uh the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">reduction of population</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">could you ask that one hey john</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">um thanks for doing this q a um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">reading um the unibomber manifesto had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">was a big turning point in my life um</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">growing up with technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">and having to question what the water</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">around me was</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:29.679" style="s2">for the first time i had two questions i</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">guess i could start with my first one</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.679" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">the carrying capacity of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">hunter-gatherer lifestyle would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">significantly less than 7 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">do you think there needs to be methods</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:39.919" style="s2">to reduce population to accomplish this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">way of living</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.919" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">how do you suppose this may happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">well one could imagine anyway uh a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">possible reversal</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">i mean it was domestication that started</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:54.240" style="s2">the huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">increase in population uh it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.240" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">uh at the beginning it was in absolute</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">numbers it wasn&#39;t a lot but</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">but uh you know in a percentage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">just gigantic just</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">leaped up but the only other thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">comparable is the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">revolution when the factory system got</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">going another great big spike in</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">so if you remove those basic things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">drive this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">you would be going in a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">direction because</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t a natural phenomenon i</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">uh noam chomsky is he&#39;s uh he&#39;s said to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">us a few times not to our face but uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">he said look you primitivists are insane</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">and genocidal there&#39;s seven billion</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">people to feed</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">and uh and the question occurs to one</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">uh mr chomsky why are there seven</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">billion people</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">how did that happen what drove that come</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">on don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">don&#39;t just yeah we know how many people</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.039" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want anyone to starve but</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">doing nothing about it having more</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">development because we&#39;ve got more</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.240" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">we need more development more factories</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">more everything uh more global warming</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s nuts that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">nuts that&#39;s just suicide</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">so i think you know it&#39;s i i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">saying this would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">easy to figure out what parts of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">process or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">transition would be needed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">bring down the numbers uh but</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">you know it&#39;s that&#39;s got to be tackled</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">you can see where it comes from so well</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">take away those things take away</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">domestication and industrialization</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">then we&#39;d be on a healthy path and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">think including a healthier number of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">people on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">you have a follow-up luncheon</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">um it&#39;s a slightly different question</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:58.400" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.400" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">technique and technology um and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">jacqueline i&#39;m curious if you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">of explain</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">your angle on it and kind of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">influenced your work i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">about the concept of molok and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">curious if this distinction helps</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">well i gotta confess i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">understood that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">and you know a little i think maybe part</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">of it maybe i&#39;m just trying to get off</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">the hook here but</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">you know uh the technological society</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">he&#39;s writing in this uh rather abstract</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">french style they&#39;re trained in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">kind of classical</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">uh mode to to the language to writing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">uh and it can be rather abstract i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;ve tried to figure out what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">the difference would</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">this technique sound more uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know reputable or something i</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s you can break it down</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">in fact i think you mentioned uh in</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">passing the unabomber manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">so-called manifesto peter</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">you know that&#39;s nothing but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">nothing but jacqueline put into more</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">american or</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">vernacular language you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">puzzle over what his technique is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">some esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">definition he has that we don&#39;t know or</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">you know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">in fact kaczynski told me that and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">said that was uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what it is industrial</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">society in its future is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">is the easy form of the technological</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much all it is he added a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">few things but</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:44.799" style="s2">much easier to read</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">cool um nick</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">benjamin you got a question</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">thank you peter hi john i&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.039" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">my question</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">um while life under late stage</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">capitalism tends toward</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">alienation stress the meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">accumulation of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">moral bankruptcy and a host of other</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:13.039" style="s2">ills if we&#39;re honest</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">it remains the undisputed attractor of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.039" end="00:24:16.720" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">its libidinal pull has us all desiring</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.720" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">our self-desecration</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">though most of us remain unaware where</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">and how do you see us countering this</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">architecture of compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">with alternate attractors of desire that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">can shift humanity toward more beautiful</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t exist but</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">but it but i&#39;m not so sure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">you know people are so enamored of it i</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">otherwise i&#39;m just just to add to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m riffing off a book written by a</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">already been colonized</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">have we lost our ability to primarily</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.919" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">express ourselves creatively or is there</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">some type of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">hope or like renaissance possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">well i hope there is with art just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">i hope there is with writing i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">writer so uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">but you know i&#39;ve looked at this largely</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">in terms of the uh what is called the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">sapient</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">paradox i just ran across this although</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:00.799" style="s2">what what this refers to i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking about for decades</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">really and that is the question of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">the how why is symbolic culture so</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">recent it&#39;s practically just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:12.480" style="s2">seconds ago in terms of the whole sweep</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">the two million years of homo species</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">uh there was no art and about 35</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">000 years ago which is you know blink of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">an eye really relatively</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">then we get to kmart we got the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:31.039" style="s2">artifacts of of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">symbolic uh culture which</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.039" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">a little bit before it became a culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">but there was there was the symbolic you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">could see it in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">not just the cave art but anyway at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">same time we know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">people were able to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">amazing uh things what we would call</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">behaviorally human</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">capacities skills over a million years</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">easily over a million years ago so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that they weren&#39;t bright enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">to come up with art</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">but somehow they didn&#39;t i mean it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">um so i&#39;ve actually tended to see this</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">compensation uh you you get art but</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to give up a lot to then</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">have that dimension to have that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">satisfaction of art</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">but it may be a trade-off there and uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">along the lines somehow you&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">to lose the immediacy and so many other</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">things about uh pre-domesticated life</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">that maybe you didn&#39;t need art just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">it didn&#39;t need number</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">or you know these other things i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">people seem to be doing fine i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">will never know what their consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:50.000" style="s2">was how they were feeling about it or</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">i mean you know it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.000" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">implication that they were just totally</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">happy to not have art but</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">well we don&#39;t know that but you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">what i mean there there were</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">there were things that were missing uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">and they were largely the bad things</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">that were missing so you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">kind of make some conjectures about how</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">um you know people went along with</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">with with without complex society</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">without domination of nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">without hierarchy and all this other</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">stuff so uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">and you know the archaeologists have</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">always puzzled over this</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not the only one you know well why</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">were they so stuck they didn&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">anything they didn&#39;t improve anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:32.240" style="s2">they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">inventing the future or nothing but and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.240" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know it just sometimes they just</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">get back to the cliche</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s fine then why jump off</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">into something else</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">which quickly becomes not fine anyway</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">that&#39;s just part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">you know conjecture about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">any follow-up question uh rachel</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:59.679" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting that you put it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">as art being just a another invention</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:04.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">i feel like a lot of artists have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.640" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">trying to bring back this primitivism</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">through art you know like as a vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">to have a re-experiencing of the times</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">have lost to civilization and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">like this colonization of the force of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">life i mean i see art as um</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">like one of the few fields where people</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">still do have um</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">more of that primal energy um you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">like just in terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">of of primal expression right um like</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">the primal inner you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">primitive soul in in the human right um</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:39.280" style="s2">and i guess my question is um even</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">though it already is a modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.280" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">invention that probably doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">exist for people to thrive</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:48.399" style="s2">um is it possible within the modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">context for art to leave uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">a primitive mark that could beckon</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">people positively</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">uh-huh uh-huh yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:34:59.680" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re grappling with what we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">you know with language with art with</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">you know trying to add something to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">equation</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">and maybe find a way out of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">so uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">music i mean these these these areas uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where we&#39;re at and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">trying to do something with what we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">i haven&#39;t given up writing because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">raised some</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">uh questions about language</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s in fact i have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">infamous essay called uh the case</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">against art</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s not it isn&#39;t the case against</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">art i was just you know being</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">provocative with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">title but it&#39;s more about origins of art</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">anyway let&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">i think you raised</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">cool thank you rachel uh our resident uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">primitive artist um evan you had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.800" style="s2">hi yeah let me pull up the what i</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">actually wrote um</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.800" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">so my my question here is um</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">about the sort of concept of of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">extended phenotype um</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">so you know uh beavers build dams uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">wasps spilled nests um lots of animals</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">create things that aren&#39;t just their</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:29.520" style="s2">physical bodies</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">um as part of their nature and when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.520" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">talk about um the sort of primitivism or</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">sort of return to these more</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">hunter-gatherer or nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">pre-agricultural pre-domestication</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">um every one of those that i&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">that we have records of still</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">developed something that we would</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">consider technology i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">bows and arrows spears flint napping etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">and and so it seems like the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">technology are</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">in humanity itself and so i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">let&#39;s suppose that we were able to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">rid of domestication and agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">what are your thoughts about how we</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">would prevent the whole cycle from</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">happening again</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">or is it desirable i assume it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">desirable to prevent the whole cycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">from happening again but</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">but what are your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">well to me it&#39;s it&#39;s instructive to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">tools and technology tools</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">uh especially tools that don&#39;t require a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">division of labor or</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">specialization because when you get into</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">uh when you get into the division of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">labor then</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">then you have systems of technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">pretty early on</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">whereas if you have whereas a tool</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">you know you can see you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">values there or the potential values</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">anyway there</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">there there&#39;s an intimacy there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s an equality in terms of again</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">simple tools</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">and those you don&#39;t have those things</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">uh you have them less and less as as</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">things develop</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">and you have the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">of technology so i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">you could say that everything is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">technology but</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s possible to to be more</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">exact about the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">definitions i think and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">yeah the equality comes in if if for</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">example if everybody&#39;s able to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">roughly the same stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">then one person isn&#39;t installed at a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">level or some effective level of control</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">over anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">because you know that&#39;s not needed you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">for example tools there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">there&#39;s some scholarship about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no gender</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">difference women or men</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">could make stone tools or you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t have these incipient uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">gradations</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">of power or authority that or the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s possible that the shaman was</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">the first specialist</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">and the shaman is not exactly a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">figure although</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">there are certainly in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">you can find</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">instances where the shaman is is really</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">a cop</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">it really uh wields his power over</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">and used it not necessarily in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">wonderful spiritual way because it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">because the authority was there and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">before it was a generalized condition</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">people knew</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">what that shaman knew but it ends up in</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">the in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">fewer people and then you then you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">a potential problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">do you have a follow-up question or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">comment evan</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">um yeah so i great answer um so i see</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">the distinction you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">between tools and technologies so my</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">my within that frame my follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">question would be something along the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">lines of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">what are your suspicions about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">caused the shift in some cultures</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">all cultures have tools and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">that only some cultures developed</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">technology and the since you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">of agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">systems of domination specialization etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">what do you think is the key</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">differentiating factor between the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">cultures that natively did and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">cultures that natively didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">wow that&#39;s a that&#39;s a huge one and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you would agree it varies from</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:34.400" style="s2">place to place and uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">climactic and other factors uh but uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.400" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">questions i i just don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">uh like people have pointed out in in</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:44.720" style="s2">germany in the 30s there was a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">town or a village</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.720" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">it was all pro hitler pro-nazi and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">kilometers away one that was not</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">and they seem to be the same there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">big difference</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">that&#39;s noticeable in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">political choice</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i i just you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">wonder what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">uh that force either forces people or</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">draws people to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">do something different i mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">it isn&#39;t perhaps strictly i mean some</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">people think</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">it&#39;s the question of population you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">more miles to feed so then you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">start farming because that&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">reliable or possibly a more reliable</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">means of feeding people and then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">other point of view is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">which is more mine that the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t start increasing until</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">domestication set in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">you know so you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">of putting the cart before the horse</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s uh i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">difficult uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">perhaps even existential question to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">some degree as to why</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">it made easier progress in some places</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">and others</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">just really did resist</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">all right uh carlos uh you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we can hear you carlos</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">uh so my question is uh in</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.920" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">how to change the course of human</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.000" style="s2">history by graber and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">wenger the author the authors present</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">uh at some point in history humans were</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">model would be a sort of transitional</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">phase and re-wildly</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">well i think there&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">flexibility there&#39;s got to be openness</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">it isn&#39;t so easy to to ponder these</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">things or maybe it is i mean i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">know you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">think maybe it is easier to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">when what uh obtains</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">isn&#39;t working you know but</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">you know and i think historically it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work out that way people</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">often more conservative when things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">rough</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:32.079" style="s2">for example the us in the 30s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a very radical period</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">actually and so many people thought it</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">was the end of capitalism but they still</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">you know didn&#39;t do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">bunch of radical things that we might</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">have thought they would under those</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">circumstances you know i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s a sad thing that graber died</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">last week at only 59</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">but he was trying i think this is fair</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">he was trying to avoid the question of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">domestication</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">he was trying to look at it differently</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:06.640" style="s2">and put something else in its place</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">and he was he was trying to find places</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.640" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">for example in prehistory that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">that did have some domestication but</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">uh not so bad you know didn&#39;t have all</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">the evils</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m not saying they can&#39;t be found</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;s always exceptions to any rule</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">i think but uh but i mean that was his</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">he was pretty set on that and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">his friend wengrow</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">as well they didn&#39;t want to they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">want to agree with the primitivists</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">to put you know put it kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">bluntly i guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">and uh there was a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">hostility on that front</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean one is right and what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">is wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">uh you i think you have to read it as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">effort to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">it&#39;s the problem isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">domestication</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s very sound i</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">mean i don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know why he&#39;s trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">but i bet again i think that uh if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">able to uh you know to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">address these things to try to openly</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">cope with what we&#39;re facing then</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">yeah we gotta have that and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">where it comes from i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.359" style="s2">i see some hopeful signs but you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s a damn</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.359" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">picture at the same time you know we</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">think we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s bleak for anarchists or anybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">all right um scott</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">you&#39;re up thanks peter uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">john um just want to thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">work i was influenced by you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">20 years ago when my kids were uh very</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">very young and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">um i was following a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">influenced uh parenting style based on</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">the continuum concept and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">and and i encountered her work and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">was very resonant</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">um particularly in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">understanding the mindset difference to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">to nurture</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">and then i try to to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">you i was completely</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">new to primitivism or it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">know much about it but i found an</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">article about you</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:22.240" style="s2">um stating that you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">a that you were living uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.240" end="00:46:24.800" style="s2">with someone and taking care of their</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">children and i thought that was very</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.800" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">that and i met i imagined that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">if i somehow needed a nanny i would want</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">you to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">my kid&#39;s nanny wow</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">so i was just wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">comment on that experience of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">of being a nurturer of very young</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">children and being in that position of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">to domesticate or not to domesticate and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">and what insights you got from that</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">well the parents man it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a lot easier to write about</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">these things than to enact them</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">yeah in the 80s i sort of threw a couple</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">of friends that could no longer</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">do that i kind of came into that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:08.319" style="s2">temporarily and ended up</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">80s and 90s i guess uh doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">that really enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">and also my time that if i could have</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">had this uh at the east blair housing</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:23.680" style="s2">co-op in eugene</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">where i was there for uh john</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:26.640" style="s2">i&#39;m just gonna jump in your i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re touching your mic but it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">going in and out and we hear some</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">friction</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">oh sorry keep my hands off the thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.319" style="s2">thanks yeah that was a somewhat similar</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.319" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">and uh i learned a lot i was living</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">across the street</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">in uh a joint household</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">this was in the 80s late 80s and uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:51.280" style="s2">and an artist friend of mine said well</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">you want to apply to the co-op you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.280" end="00:47:53.359" style="s2">and i i</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">lived across the street but i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.359" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">even know it was a co-op anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">uh i learned an awful lot of that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.599" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">there were a lot of single parents</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">that co-op was oh 40 50 adults</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">and then children a lot of single</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">uh single dads as well as single moms</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">anyway things it was a self-managed</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">thing it went you know committees</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">deciding stuff and people doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:22.480" style="s2">the upkeep and so on</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">and i one thing i discovered is how</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.480" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">and maybe i sort of knew this</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">intellectually maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:30.480" style="s2">i didn&#39;t really know it i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">difference between the way women operate</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">the way men tend to operate was really</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">instructive i mean it was just</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">it just seemed to me in the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:39.599" style="s2">exceptions and everything but just a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">healthier</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.599" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">let&#39;s get this done rather than kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">jockeying for</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">influence or you know competing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">other guys or something it was uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">it was pretty noticeable and uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">yeah that they uh the time with uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">taking care of kids</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">i had no money and that so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">wonderful thing just on that level but</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">more than that it was it was great</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">all right um so this might be the last</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">question or we might have one more</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">uh after it uh pde uh if you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">interact um sir i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">just maybe as a natural bias tempted to</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.319" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">take the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">the optimist position on civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:29.839" style="s2">um and the optimist story it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">has to be some version of well look yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.839" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">has like these really profound sources</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">of unsustainability</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.520" end="00:49:39.359" style="s2">you know a population globally climate</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.359" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">um maybe some questions about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">doing with digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">things certainly can&#39;t go on in their</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">present form</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">um but you can also see like fairly</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">like these are really new problems and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">you can see some fairly</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">large and impressive efforts um</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">within the kind of weird systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">have to try to tackle them you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">global capitalism for all like its late</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">stage problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">is trying to get carbon under control um</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">technologists are trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">how to make digital technology that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t terrible we&#39;re like we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">figured it out yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">um and so with that optimistic take</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">and then the primitivist take i guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">the question that i&#39;m drawn to is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:25.920" style="s2">how do</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">what kind of methodology can we use to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.920" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">decide between these perspectives do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">like a a way you like to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">to argue this out systematically with</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">with those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">who either say yeah we&#39;ll probably get</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">through this or</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">there&#39;s no other way but to get through</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">it right it&#39;s like civilization has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">through or not back well i guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">i guess one starts empirically i mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">are these things turning out</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">are they is uh is it a fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">record of progress with these things and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where you can find uh that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all working out just a little more</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">technology and that&#39;s gonna be always</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">and yet uh the record uh not so sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">it&#39;s showing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it seems to me it&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">deepening the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">you know i mean we all want some relief</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">we all want uh things to work and uh not</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">uh so uh scary or</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">making us more vulnerable but</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:30.880" style="s2">and part of it or maybe a large part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:33.040" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.880" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">i mean you keep reading about ais</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.040" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">marching forward and self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.760" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">everything else and uh maybe they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">maybe they will work out the kinks to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">lot of that but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">you know i think the bottom line is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">and it just seems to me it is a sorry</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">damn picture</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">i mean i know i have friends that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:58.000" style="s2">are totally relying on drugs to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">through the day i have a very suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.000" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">uh this is somewhat new you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">severity of it is new and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">people are just they&#39;re not in good</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">health it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">the dis-ease of it all isn&#39;t just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">not just to play on words but</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">the disease has to do with dis-ease and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:21.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.119" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t satisfy maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:30.880" style="s2">can&#39;t satisfy on the level of technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">even though well and of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.880" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">every different shade or</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">gradient of of optimism and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">i&#39;m glad somebody to bring up to bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">up the other point of view</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">but um i mean for example the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">transhumanists they&#39;re just giddy we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">get to the singularity</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">there&#39;ll be so much technology we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">reach the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">well the singularity and it&#39;s suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">bang everything will be fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">we&#39;ll live forever everything will be</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">healed meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:05.680" style="s2">uh more and more of it as i said</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">uh doesn&#39;t seem to be easing anything it</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.680" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">just really doesn&#39;t i see</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">i was quoting on my weekly radio show</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">the other night uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">citrix and i never even heard of citrix</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s some giant</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">networking uh outfit some high-tech</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">outfit</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.200" style="s2">and they had a long full-page ad and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">part of it read</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.200" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">imagine what we could be if technology</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">pulled out</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">all the stops and i was just staggered</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">by that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">it isn&#39;t pulling out all the stops for</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:40.160" style="s2">and be all we can be i mean people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">in sorry shape man it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.160" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">i can&#39;t believe how this walking wounded</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:45.680" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">there&#39;s and of course there&#39;s tons and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.680" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">tons of written on that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">you know you could say well these are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">the people that are what are they losers</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">or what are they</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">they got a point to make a point to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">or some</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">well now the overwhelming weight of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">from academia as well as from</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:05.680" style="s2">journalists and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">the whole thing there is no disputing</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.680" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">the picture</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">and i just don&#39;t think more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">is going to be the solution</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">do you have a quick follow-up pde</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">you&#39;re mute</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i do i mean i feel it</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">feels like a reasonable answer and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">you know to to to then to try to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:37.520" style="s2">into the weeds on each of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">directions you know other mitigations</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.520" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">for climate change working</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">like yes to some degree possibly way too</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">slowly</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">um mental health</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">uh i i don&#39;t feel like i know that the</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">well enough clearly you could make a</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">case that there are like psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">unhealthy things about</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">contemporary western societies um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">uh and maybe that turns out to be true</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">though it probably doesn&#39;t cause</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">fundamental unsustainability it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">something that&#39;s bad about them</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">um that we should try to fix and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">i think people have you know for 30 or</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">40 years have been saying oh it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:17.280" style="s2">be fine</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">and i&#39;m really not sure that it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:26.760" style="s2">but uh that one looks like the big</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:29.520" style="s2">unaddressed crisis that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.760" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">pro-civilizationists and primitivists</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.520" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">will have to grapple with together</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">is a lot of moving parts and uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">you know i look for the upside i look</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">for the silver lining and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">i i feel personally fine you know but</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean anything it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">mean i&#39;m unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">the what i would call the growing</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">immigration</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:57.359" style="s2">uh and not just psychologically but uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">but yeah we have to grapple with all</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.359" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">this somehow and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">i&#39;m just hoping that there&#39;s more ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">uh open up the dialogue you know to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">more of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:11.680" style="s2">that includes more you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">that&#39;s allowed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.680" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">uh that can be seen as as permissible or</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:19.920" style="s2">respectable and uh i hope so before too</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.920" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">more time is allowed to go by</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">all right um so we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">to the close uh so</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">uh john any closing thoughts for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">anything you&#39;d like to leave us with</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">oh boy um</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">i know all these questions were coming</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">at you from all these different</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">directions but</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the what happens at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">stoa oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">no it&#39;s great to have this uh be able to</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">have this conversation it&#39;s terrific</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">we just have to strive to get more of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">and i do think there there are some</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not enough i was expecting</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">more that there would be by this time</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">more of an opening</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">to be raising questions like these and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:08.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just happening a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.960" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">little bit but uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t want to be painting</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">some over optimistic picture either</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">just see uh now of course here in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">states that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">the dominant media the corporate media</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">is about a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:31.040" style="s2">all about the presidential election</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">and and of course rightly so about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s there&#39;s even less room at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">to kind of step back and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">you know trying to look at things more</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">um you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">because the whole thing is really i mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">for example voting i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">like we all know i think everybody here</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">would agree i&#39;m guessing here but</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">uh trump is absolutely loathsome just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:04.480" style="s2">you know a despicable individual</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">and so people say well you got to vote</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:07.119" style="s2">you got to vote it&#39;s it&#39;s between life</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">and death</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.119" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">well it isn&#39;t it&#39;s between death and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">death to pick the other guy</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">it keeps on getting worse it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">to save anything</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">i mean he&#39;s as a person i&#39;m sure he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">more decent than trump for god&#39;s sake</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">but so what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">you know that&#39;s you&#39;re letting it slip</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">by it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to work anyway that&#39;s</p>
