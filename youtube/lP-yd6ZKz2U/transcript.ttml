<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:14.009" style="s2">I wanted to first ask you guys how are</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.610" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">you doing how&#39;s everything how are you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.009" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">and and your families and you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">without anything personal just what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">going on over there in Toronto so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">doing well as all the people I love and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">care about including Chris and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">no in-person classes at the University</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:40.129" style="s2">of Toronto so I&#39;ve been switching</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">everything over to virtual the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.129" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">psychology department the department</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">physically closed on Friday I fully</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">expect that the entire University will</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">be physically closed as a month beer</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">Tuesday I think they&#39;re trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">it open as long as possible for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">libraries and whatnot but I expect that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">shortly because the premiere has asked</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:09.020" style="s2">us to go into pretty much lockdown so</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">and the University of course being</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.020" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">publicly funded a university will follow</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">what the premier says so I fully expect</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">that that will be it when what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">happen I don&#39;t know going forward I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">already received one email indicating</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:24.290" style="s2">that the courses that I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">teach in May and June</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.290" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">nothing official has been said but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">should plan for them to be done totally</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">virtually as well so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">happening sort of professionally and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">personally what&#39;s happening virtually is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a couple of talks with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">Hall around kovat 19 and issues around</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.820" end="00:01:50.189" style="s2">it around rationality and faith and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">starting Monday I&#39;m going to offer a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.189" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">live streaming free meditation course</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">for people so that they will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">go come on and I&#39;ll take them through</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:04.820" style="s2">like a 10 to 12 week meditation course</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">when I know it&#39;ll be mornings 9:30</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:14.650" style="s2">usually teach</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">probably a new principal Monday and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.650" end="00:02:18.580" style="s2">Thursdays and then in between we&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:19.720" style="s2">just meet regularly and sit together so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.580" end="00:02:22.240" style="s2">that&#39;s something I&#39;m gonna try and do to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.720" end="00:02:24.220" style="s2">help people out and Peter Lindbergh and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.240" end="00:02:26.230" style="s2">I are also putting together he&#39;s trying</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.230" end="00:02:31.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve got some of the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.020" end="00:02:34.240" style="s2">Stoics involved current Stoics I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.840" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">was not like we resurrected anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.240" end="00:02:42.070" style="s2">no Seneca Seneca will be yeah so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:46.480" style="s2">gonna be offering that for people as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.070" end="00:02:49.630" style="s2">place where they can go also to well try</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:51.070" style="s2">to cultivate some in-person stoicism to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.630" end="00:02:53.620" style="s2">give them a way of dealing with some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.070" end="00:02:55.240" style="s2">the extra strains that this is putting</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.620" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">on their lives so that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.240" end="00:02:58.660" style="s2">where I&#39;m at right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">hmm so how about you Christian is there</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.660" end="00:03:04.210" style="s2">anything you want to add to that no not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.880" style="s2">really I&#39;m also fine my me and mine are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.210" end="00:03:10.390" style="s2">fine so far um we&#39;ve been very fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.880" end="00:03:13.900" style="s2">I think comparably here next to much of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.390" end="00:03:15.550" style="s2">the rest of the world I think and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.900" end="00:03:17.800" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been off work for</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.550" end="00:03:19.420" style="s2">some months anyway so my day-to-day life</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.800" end="00:03:20.380" style="s2">hasn&#39;t changed a whole lot although I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.420" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">learning that there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.380" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">between like elective solitude and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:26.709" style="s2">solitude by ordinance the activities on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:28.360" style="s2">the ground aren&#39;t all that different</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.709" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">that feeling is a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.360" end="00:03:32.260" style="s2">it has it&#39;s not quite an ordinance yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">here but it&#39;s that&#39;s just shy of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.260" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like we haven&#39;t been ordered to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:37.240" style="s2">remain cloistered in our homes but but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:39.310" style="s2">everything is as John said everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.240" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">more or less shuttered so you really you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of options if you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:47.110" style="s2">to venture out anyway but yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.630" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">say so far so good so far so good</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.110" end="00:03:52.390" style="s2">yeah how are you doing Andrew Oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:56.110" style="s2">something first I do person I were both</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.390" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">talking just before you came into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.110" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">room that we were actually very pleased</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">with how our both our federal and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.690" style="s2">provincial governments are handling this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">we&#39;re very happy about that and we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.690" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">they&#39;re doing an excellent job mmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:13.690" style="s2">that&#39;s good to know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">yeah about me personally well it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.690" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m an overworked</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:22.040" style="s2">underpaid teacher I would say so in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.040" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">months I&#39;ve been working crazily doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:32.310" style="s2">lot of classes and also doing this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:34.790" style="s2">of thing so so I&#39;ve been overworked</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.310" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">basically and a little bit burnt out and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.790" end="00:04:40.950" style="s2">so now I&#39;m on total lockdown I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve been on total lockdown for about a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.950" end="00:04:48.600" style="s2">week here in France and luckily we moved</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:52.220" style="s2">last year to the edge of Paris so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.600" end="00:04:56.300" style="s2">have a little garden so I&#39;m feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.220" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">I&#39;m very lucky compared to a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.300" end="00:05:02.040" style="s2">friends and colleagues who are stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">little apartments in Paris and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.040" end="00:05:05.550" style="s2">can&#39;t leave without a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">basically no they they need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.550" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">piece of paper to say I&#39;m going to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:12.570" style="s2">store or I&#39;m going for a jog or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">something like that so it&#39;s very extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.570" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">here and it seems we&#39;re on the up curve</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:20.010" style="s2">so it&#39;s just getting worse in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">numbers but so there&#39;s this extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.010" end="00:05:24.540" style="s2">contrast between how wonderful my life</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.590" end="00:05:26.520" style="s2">is right now I&#39;m here with my family and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.540" end="00:05:29.580" style="s2">I&#39;m doing I&#39;m working remotely like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:31.950" style="s2">you John and I I&#39;m doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.580" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">physical work every morning and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.950" end="00:05:37.590" style="s2">feeling much healthier than I have in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">long time actually and the grim picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:44.040" style="s2">outside and my neighbor who&#39;s elderly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">and just had a stroke and and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.040" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">odd he can&#39;t really we&#39;re not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">to go and talk to her and so well</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">usually we have a relationship so so so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a very very extreme</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:59.790" style="s2">contrast between me right now feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">like I&#39;m living my life like I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.790" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">want to be living my life really almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:08.730" style="s2">in a retreat like a Buddhist retreat</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:14.490" style="s2">with my family and and then the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.730" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">situation outside yeah so that&#39;s Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.490" end="00:06:18.120" style="s2">I just I&#39;m just this is a practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.100" style="s2">curiosity but I&#39;ve heard of that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.120" end="00:06:21.419" style="s2">heard I know this is true of Italy I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.100" end="00:06:23.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that it was also true of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:25.590" style="s2">France that you need some kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.880" end="00:06:27.419" style="s2">need effectively a permission slip to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.590" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">out and carry on your business what what</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.419" end="00:06:31.470" style="s2">does that mean like where do you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.770" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">that is you you can find it on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.470" end="00:06:33.720" style="s2">internet and you have to print it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">and it has to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.720" end="00:06:40.200" style="s2">date on it so we&#39;ve had our groceries</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:43.560" style="s2">delivered so I haven&#39;t even gone out and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.200" end="00:06:45.300" style="s2">done that yet actually but but so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.560" end="00:06:47.370" style="s2">guess you you can change the date each</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.300" end="00:06:49.350" style="s2">time you go go out and you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.370" end="00:06:52.020" style="s2">why you&#39;re going out if you&#39;re going out</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.350" end="00:06:54.200" style="s2">to walk the dog or go for a jog you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.020" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">to be six meters away from other people</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.200" end="00:06:58.200" style="s2">six meters something is something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:06:59.850" style="s2">that maybe I&#39;ve got that wrong I could I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.200" end="00:07:01.470" style="s2">could have a but but you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.850" end="00:07:03.480" style="s2">really keep a distance from everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.470" end="00:07:05.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not allowed to go out with my family</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.480" end="00:07:09.510" style="s2">for a walk for example I can go out</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.160" end="00:07:14.010" style="s2">alone I can go for a jog and I could do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.510" end="00:07:15.870" style="s2">exercise or go for a walk but but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.010" end="00:07:20.520" style="s2">again I&#39;m in a little village so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.870" end="00:07:22.230" style="s2">in the heat of the the the the heat of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.520" end="00:07:24.390" style="s2">the thing which a lot of my friends in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.230" end="00:07:26.550" style="s2">Paris are and I can kind of I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.390" end="00:07:29.660" style="s2">that from them that it&#39;s very intense I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.550" end="00:07:33.030" style="s2">think being stuck in a small apartment</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.660" end="00:07:35.790" style="s2">would be would be pretty hard yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.030" end="00:07:39.419" style="s2">know so I read your papers your paper</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.790" end="00:07:42.810" style="s2">today much too quickly i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">going to reread it in more more detail</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.810" end="00:07:46.710" style="s2">here it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:49.080" style="s2">gnosis in the second person responding</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.710" end="00:07:52.290" style="s2">to the meaning crisis in the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.080" end="00:07:58.880" style="s2">quest of authentic dialogue so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.290" end="00:08:01.020" style="s2">struck me in the end is is and please</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.880" end="00:08:02.669" style="s2">correct me if I&#39;m wrong if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.020" end="00:08:08.370" style="s2">misunderstood something because I this</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.669" end="00:08:13.050" style="s2">is a big overview so this is about dialo</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.370" end="00:08:16.950" style="s2">goes right yeah and you outline sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.050" end="00:08:20.310" style="s2">five dimensions of dialogue OHS and one</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.950" end="00:08:22.290" style="s2">is the let&#39;s say person to person which</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.310" end="00:08:26.550" style="s2">is the horizontal dimension of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.290" end="00:08:28.830" style="s2">us me talking to you and then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:32.039" style="s2">vertical dimension which is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.830" end="00:08:34.370" style="s2">talking to to being about questioning</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.039" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">yourself and/or your existence I guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.370" end="00:08:40.050" style="s2">or being itself and then you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">how that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.050" end="00:08:45.150" style="s2">but that moves into something a third</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:47.640" style="s2">dimension which is related to the eye</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.150" end="00:08:49.590" style="s2">maybe the ID though in some level that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.640" end="00:08:52.230" style="s2">something is created out of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.590" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">dialogue hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.230" end="00:08:58.200" style="s2">and I and then the fourth dimension is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">that moves into time and then the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.200" end="00:09:03.660" style="s2">dimension is a kind of timelessness that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:05.460" style="s2">results and so so I like this whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.660" end="00:09:07.710" style="s2">model I think it&#39;s very very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.460" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2">and I wondered if you could just go into</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.710" end="00:09:13.530" style="s2">detail and flush it out a bit so I&#39;ll uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.100" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">I&#39;ll start Chris and I&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.530" end="00:09:19.910" style="s2">tag-team a lot because our thinking on</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">this paper is deeply symbiotic I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.910" end="00:09:24.510" style="s2">one thing is to perhaps it would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:25.950" style="s2">useful to keep a distinction in hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.510" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">that we could refer to throughout which</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.950" end="00:09:32.100" style="s2">is dialogo cesare the process that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:34.920" style="s2">being realized and dialectic is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.100" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">psycho technology that people can learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.920" end="00:09:40.230" style="s2">and practice in order to try and realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:43.530" style="s2">the process and try to cause it to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.230" end="00:09:44.460" style="s2">instantiated in a dialogue and so part</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.530" end="00:09:48.180" style="s2">of what we&#39;re trying to do in the paper</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.460" end="00:09:51.840" style="s2">is to figure out as you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.180" end="00:09:55.820" style="s2">the dimensions both phenomenological and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:10:00.030" style="s2">functional of D logos as a process and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.820" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">we&#39;re also starting to that of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.030" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">has merit in its own right we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:05.340" style="s2">doing that also because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.630" end="00:10:07.350" style="s2">figure out from the phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.340" end="00:10:09.750" style="s2">the functionality what the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.350" end="00:10:11.700" style="s2">technology should look like what should</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.750" end="00:10:12.900" style="s2">dialectic look like what are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.700" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">features that should be put into</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.900" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">practice and the hope is the oral hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">from the paper is if we can work back</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:22.290" style="s2">from the phenomenology and functionality</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:25.860" style="s2">of the Ilocos into sort of reverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.290" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">engineering the dialectic we can put</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.860" end="00:10:31.350" style="s2">that potentially into a deep dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:34.280" style="s2">and I choose that term intentionally a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.350" end="00:10:36.570" style="s2">deep dialogue with what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.280" end="00:10:39.980" style="s2">Socratic practice within the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.570" end="00:10:44.030" style="s2">dialogues and the Neoplatonic traditions</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.980" end="00:10:46.850" style="s2">as a way of then putting all of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.030" end="00:10:49.499" style="s2">into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.850" end="00:10:51.809" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.499" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">emergence of both psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.809" end="00:11:00.139" style="s2">like guy sense talks circling or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.509" style="s2">know Atwood Rocha is empathy circling or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.139" end="00:11:06.299" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.509" end="00:11:09.179" style="s2">aunty debate these new practices and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.299" end="00:11:10.739" style="s2">their attempts to tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.179" end="00:11:11.989" style="s2">collective intelligence of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.739" end="00:11:14.819" style="s2">cognition and so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.989" end="00:11:17.249" style="s2">reverse-engineer dialectic put it into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.819" end="00:11:19.559" style="s2">contact with the historical scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.249" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">of platonic dialectic take that whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.559" end="00:11:24.299" style="s2">thing and put it into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:27.589" style="s2">these emerging practices in which people</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.299" end="00:11:31.139" style="s2">are seeking to reformulate Andry vivify</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.589" end="00:11:33.929" style="s2">dialogue so that it can be a means by</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.139" end="00:11:37.319" style="s2">which people can cultivate wisdom in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.929" end="00:11:44.309" style="s2">deep sense then we think what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.319" end="00:11:46.410" style="s2">is help to bring philosophy ax the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.309" end="00:11:49.199" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom into these</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.410" end="00:11:51.419" style="s2">emerging practices because I generally</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.199" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">see although I have great value and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.419" end="00:11:55.319" style="s2">appreciation and I participate in these</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:58.829" style="s2">practices I&#39;m not just an outsider of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.319" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">great value and appreciation for things</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.829" end="00:12:02.879" style="s2">like circling and I&#39;m in constant</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">communication with guys and Stein and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.879" end="00:12:08.609" style="s2">guy actually sanctions this in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:11.009" style="s2">positive sense on what I&#39;m about to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.609" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">I see these practices as largely lacking</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.009" end="00:12:15.959" style="s2">the integration with philosophy ax and</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:17.699" style="s2">that maybe means if can i interject a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.959" end="00:12:20.609" style="s2">little bit of lacking in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.699" end="00:12:22.919" style="s2">lacking in a Nigerian yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.609" end="00:12:25.919" style="s2">you&#39;re in when we what Heidegger means</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.919" end="00:12:27.569" style="s2">by thinking yeah this is almost taboo in</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.919" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">in these kind of circles we&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.569" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">to have a we&#39;re supposed to work on our</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:37.709" style="s2">feeling somatic experiences and then on</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:41.429" style="s2">the other hand so there&#39;s this divide</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.709" end="00:12:44.249" style="s2">between the somatic experience and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.429" end="00:12:47.359" style="s2">somatic Romanticism yeah there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.249" end="00:12:49.829" style="s2">intellectualization and extreme sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.359" end="00:12:51.509" style="s2">empiricism on one hand and extreme sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.829" end="00:12:53.309" style="s2">of experience on the other am i give you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.509" end="00:12:55.949" style="s2">very much very much I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.309" end="00:12:59.210" style="s2">I think there&#39;s kind of yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.949" end="00:13:02.350" style="s2">kind of a Cartesian intellectualism</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.210" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">that&#39;s often the presentation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.350" end="00:13:06.260" style="s2">propositional argumentation or there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.760" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">sort of it like I call it the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.260" end="00:13:11.210" style="s2">romantic moment a system where somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">by sort of exploring our somatic States</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.210" end="00:13:18.260" style="s2">we will accrue to the good life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:20.180" style="s2">not to say that there isn&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.260" end="00:13:22.340" style="s2">value in mindfulness and reception you</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.180" end="00:13:28.070" style="s2">know I buy and hold all of that but I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.340" end="00:13:30.020" style="s2">agree what&#39;s missing and I think you put</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.070" end="00:13:31.610" style="s2">your finger on it well in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.020" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">practices where we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.610" end="00:13:37.490" style="s2">communicate and even commune if by that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">we mean that the connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.490" end="00:13:41.750" style="s2">intimacy between people is also valued</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:44.570" style="s2">what&#39;s missing and all in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.750" end="00:13:47.000" style="s2">practices is like I said is but how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.570" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">they how do they help us cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.000" end="00:13:51.740" style="s2">wisdom both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">collectively in a way that&#39;s seriously</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.740" end="00:13:57.950" style="s2">needed for addressing the meaning crisis</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.070" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">yeah yeah um so I mean the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.720" end="00:14:45.950" style="s2">Socrates is such a choice symbol or</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.970" end="00:14:49.160" style="s2">symbol only for us is precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.950" end="00:14:52.100" style="s2">the Socratic dialogue goes combines the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.160" end="00:14:54.020" style="s2">dramaturgical dimensions of in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.080" end="00:15:01.310" style="s2">right the dimension of it that&#39;s played</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.060" end="00:15:03.200" style="s2">through and dramatized and enacted and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.310" end="00:15:08.300" style="s2">then the dimension of it that then</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.200" end="00:15:10.220" style="s2">regather zazz as a as a process of of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.300" end="00:15:12.769" style="s2">what we might call reasoning or</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.220" end="00:15:17.179" style="s2">rationing right and so because because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.769" end="00:15:18.920" style="s2">Socrates as a symbol is both a entreats</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.179" end="00:15:21.410" style="s2">us to both at once he entreats us both</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.959" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">you have what we called or what right</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.160" end="00:15:53.449" style="s2">they&#39;re bundled together and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">because of the nature of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.449" end="00:15:57.589" style="s2">because of his countenance he tends to</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.589" end="00:16:01.699" style="s2">because Socrates sort of stands Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.290" end="00:16:04.459" style="s2">is both a personal and impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.699" end="00:16:06.739" style="s2">mystery right and we don&#39;t know who that</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.459" end="00:16:08.869" style="s2">somehow who knowing who Socrates is</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:27.980" style="s2">opens so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve dropped him I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.790" end="00:16:29.720" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not exactly an ingenious move</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.980" end="00:16:32.179" style="s2">Socrates has been this for a long long</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.720" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">time too many people we&#39;ve dropped him</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.179" end="00:16:36.199" style="s2">into the middle of this because he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:38.689" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s an emissary and an exemplar</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.199" end="00:16:43.269" style="s2">for it at same time right so he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.689" end="00:16:45.970" style="s2">bridge and he&#39;s sort of a bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.269" end="00:16:48.049" style="s2">the per the personal and the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.970" end="00:16:49.970" style="s2">going back and forth and he also</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.049" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">transcends both the personal and the</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:56.360" style="s2">well he variously presents himself as a</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.360" end="00:17:04.100" style="s2">and as Mattacks ooh somehow between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.019" end="00:17:06.260" style="s2">human and the divine and so he he</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.100" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">consciously or at least through in</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.260" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">plato&#39;s dialogue identifies with those</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:26.540" style="s2">identity for human beings and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.220" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">he sits between the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.540" end="00:17:31.010" style="s2">devine and therefore he can bind both of</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.010" end="00:17:36.620" style="s2">good book Heidegger&#39;s Platonism talks</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.080" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2">about why Socrates in the dialogic form</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.700" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">baby the basic idea is and it&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:55.730" style="s2">think it actually comports a very well</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.650" end="00:18:13.550" style="s2">need three things you need argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:14.990" style="s2">obviously mm-hmm in order to do as Chris</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.550" end="00:18:16.850" style="s2">said provoke those kinds of profound</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.990" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">insight it has to be a kind of an</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:22.280" style="s2">affordance of aporia right that that way</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.600" end="00:18:24.290" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re forced to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.280" end="00:18:25.610" style="s2">wonder in a profound way to call</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.290" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">yourself into question and think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.610" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">Heidegger we are the beings whose aporia</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:34.460" style="s2">is means a sort of a state of unknown</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:37.490" style="s2">buck City yeah that&#39;s like a net right</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.460" end="00:18:40.340" style="s2">yeah deep deep perplexity an epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.490" end="00:18:42.770" style="s2">precipice beyond okay so he pushes you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.340" end="00:18:44.450" style="s2">little bit towards the precipice and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.770" end="00:18:46.040" style="s2">then you stand back and you experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.450" end="00:18:47.900" style="s2">wonder and everything comes into</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.040" end="00:18:50.030" style="s2">question and therefore you you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.900" end="00:18:51.860" style="s2">actually identify with what Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.030" end="00:18:55.130" style="s2">would call design you identify with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.860" end="00:18:56.510" style="s2">aspect that seems to be central to human</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.130" end="00:18:58.460" style="s2">beings how we are the beings whose</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.510" end="00:19:01.070" style="s2">beings are in question and that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.460" end="00:19:04.370" style="s2">a privileged kind of access in our being</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.070" end="00:19:07.730" style="s2">not in a not in our self or oh yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.370" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">a nurse analogy but but beyond that not</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.730" end="00:19:12.020" style="s2">yeah not just in our propositional</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">thoughts but in in that deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.020" end="00:19:15.590" style="s2">thing we&#39;re talking about earlier the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.130" end="00:19:18.530" style="s2">thinking and so that of course it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.590" end="00:19:20.330" style="s2">centrally are the argumentation but you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.530" end="00:19:22.700" style="s2">but what you you don&#39;t have just a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.330" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">competition of arguments right in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.700" end="00:19:26.570" style="s2">dialogue you also the competition of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.380" end="00:19:28.280" style="s2">ways of life separate you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.570" end="00:19:30.680" style="s2">represent a way of life he represents</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:32.800" style="s2">the unexamined life that is right sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.680" end="00:19:34.520" style="s2">the examined life is living in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.800" end="00:19:36.800" style="s2">competition so you&#39;re not only having</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:40.130" style="s2">arguments in competition you need to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.800" end="00:19:43.430" style="s2">ways of life in competition</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.130" end="00:19:45.590" style="s2">with each other hey yeah continue your</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:46.850" style="s2">thought I just will make the third point</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.590" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">and you can choose how you wish to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.850" end="00:19:52.100" style="s2">respond and so Socrates exemplifies the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.240" style="s2">competition between arguments that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.100" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">supposed to induce wonder and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.240" end="00:19:57.590" style="s2">insight that Chris mentioned he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">supposed to you can&#39;t do this with</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.590" end="00:20:01.700" style="s2">argumentation you have to in order to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:04.190" style="s2">represent the competition between ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.700" end="00:20:06.770" style="s2">of life you have to rely on drama that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.190" end="00:20:09.410" style="s2">so the das be embodied all right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.770" end="00:20:10.670" style="s2">you have to have that and right so how</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.410" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">are you gonna get argument and drama</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.670" end="00:20:14.450" style="s2">together you need dialogue and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">next thing you need right is you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.450" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">you need Socrates represents aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:22.310" style="s2">he represents our relationship to our</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:24.620" style="s2">sacred second self he represents a call</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.620" end="00:20:30.650" style="s2">right and that call to to I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.270" end="00:20:33.470" style="s2">another reason why has to be symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.650" end="00:20:36.290" style="s2">for us that call to self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.470" end="00:20:40.040" style="s2">right that&#39;s there has to be you need a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.290" end="00:20:43.730" style="s2">form of thinking that&#39;s inherently woven</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.040" end="00:20:46.010" style="s2">with symbol it has to it has to both</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.730" end="00:20:48.110" style="s2">reach you where you are but draw you</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.010" end="00:20:50.090" style="s2">beyond where you are it has to do a dues</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.110" end="00:20:53.300" style="s2">it has to it has to be the Midwife for</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.090" end="00:20:55.460" style="s2">you and so the dialogue is also the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.300" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">in which you represent that aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.460" end="00:21:00.200" style="s2">relationship right it&#39;s in the back and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">forth between you the interlocutors and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.200" end="00:21:04.250" style="s2">Socrates that you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">aspirational movement taking place the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.250" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">dialogue they that the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:10.340" style="s2">dialogues are like they&#39;re non</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:13.940" style="s2">completable they&#39;re open-ended they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.340" end="00:21:15.500" style="s2">often emergent is exactly required for</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.940" end="00:21:19.220" style="s2">representing what Plato is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.500" end="00:21:21.080" style="s2">talk about so the so I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.220" end="00:21:25.420" style="s2">there&#39;s these three deep ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">Socrates exemplifies the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.420" end="00:21:29.830" style="s2">dialogue for the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:34.490" style="s2">mmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.830" end="00:21:37.880" style="s2">you were talking about the examined life</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.490" end="00:21:41.900" style="s2">in the unexamined life okay yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.880" end="00:21:44.920" style="s2">as you were saying that what came to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.900" end="00:21:47.450" style="s2">right now is the event that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.920" end="00:21:49.060" style="s2">experiencing which seems to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.450" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">background of all of our discussions</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.060" end="00:21:55.790" style="s2">even if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:57.190" style="s2">you know philosophical high abstract</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.790" end="00:22:02.300" style="s2">philosophical things Oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.190" end="00:22:04.280" style="s2">and so so I want I want to somehow make</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.300" end="00:22:08.840" style="s2">a bridge to what&#39;s going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.280" end="00:22:12.560" style="s2">right now and and the examined life and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.840" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">and what that means in the face of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.560" end="00:22:19.700" style="s2">extraordinary thing that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:22.070" style="s2">the world coronavirus or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.700" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2">how this can and also how to how this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.070" end="00:22:26.840" style="s2">can help us in terms of this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.100" end="00:22:29.870" style="s2">owes in terms of making life more</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.840" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">meaning through dialogue owes how can we</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.870" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">relate that to our actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:38.290" style="s2">right now you do you have anything to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:40.550" style="s2">say well I do I want to give I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.290" end="00:22:42.470" style="s2">relate a quick story and it will</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.550" end="00:22:45.290" style="s2">directly concerns Chris and that way I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.470" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">can segue to Chris yes I wanna hear what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.290" end="00:22:48.110" style="s2">he was just because Chris and I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.360" style="s2">been talking about this at length and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.110" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2">want I want him to take over a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.360" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">bit on this but I had another meeting</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:22:57.470" style="s2">with virtual meeting somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:23:01.010" style="s2">interviewing me about the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.470" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">and we were talking and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.010" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">at one point and I said I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">very careful with the language and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:11.270" style="s2">said and he picked up on that knee and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:14.360" style="s2">he&#39;s like you know that he really liked</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.270" end="00:23:16.910" style="s2">that and and then he and then I said you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.360" end="00:23:20.540" style="s2">know you know and then I pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.910" end="00:23:24.560" style="s2">Chris and Chris is gift his great gift</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.540" end="00:23:27.770" style="s2">for being both you know capable of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.560" end="00:23:29.870" style="s2">precision of expression that is at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">same time beautiful and beauty is one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.870" end="00:23:34.760" style="s2">the ways in which we aspire right this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:37.490" style="s2">is a plutonic idea and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.760" end="00:23:38.900" style="s2">that I pointed to Chris about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.490" end="00:23:41.060" style="s2">because Eric I was trying to say how</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.900" end="00:23:44.920" style="s2">that precision and beautification of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.060" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">thought is so needed and he had this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.920" end="00:23:49.790" style="s2">responsible spontaneous and beautiful he</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">said of course I would he said this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.790" end="00:23:54.470" style="s2">literally he said I would rather die</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">than not talk like that and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.470" end="00:23:57.710" style="s2">this example because it&#39;s very pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">to what we&#39;re talking about right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.710" end="00:24:03.530" style="s2">he&#39;s in the middle of this crisis and he</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:05.159" style="s2">says to me right he says it very since</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.530" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">earth I&#39;d rather died and not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.159" end="00:24:10.289" style="s2">to talk that way and then I said to him</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.320" end="00:24:12.599" style="s2">that&#39;s you I said you know you&#39;ve said a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.289" end="00:24:13.889" style="s2">lot but that&#39;s the Socratic moment for</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.599" end="00:24:15.929" style="s2">me that&#39;s what you that&#39;s where you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.889" end="00:24:18.659" style="s2">it not in thought but you get it in</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.929" end="00:24:20.460" style="s2">yourself like you&#39;re being right that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.659" end="00:24:23.609" style="s2">the unexamined life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.460" end="00:24:26.129" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about that and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.609" end="00:24:28.169" style="s2">know and notice that the context the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.129" end="00:24:30.479" style="s2">language he used and the context in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.169" end="00:24:33.029" style="s2">which Socrates offered that Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.479" end="00:24:36.450" style="s2">facing death the person that I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.029" end="00:24:38.039" style="s2">talking to he is you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.450" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">facing the situation you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.039" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">Andrew and that&#39;s that comes out from</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:46.099" style="s2">him naturally and spontaneously there</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:48.779" style="s2">right and so there there there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.099" end="00:24:51.330" style="s2">obviously you know there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.779" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">which we&#39;re jumping up and down Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.330" end="00:24:56.190" style="s2">hierarchy of needs right now and people</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:58.529" style="s2">have to take care of their survival but</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.190" end="00:25:02.629" style="s2">there&#39;s a point at which right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.529" end="00:25:06.200" style="s2">point at which people also need a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.629" end="00:25:09.149" style="s2">meaning to a difficult difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.200" end="00:25:10.950" style="s2">situation in fact in the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.149" end="00:25:13.769" style="s2">of situations the most threatening of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.950" end="00:25:17.099" style="s2">situations they are willing to put mere</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.769" end="00:25:20.249" style="s2">survival at risk in order to try and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.099" end="00:25:23.849" style="s2">maintain an examined and meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.249" end="00:25:27.899" style="s2">period as I said Chris came readily to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.849" end="00:25:28.979" style="s2">my mind about that deep connection him</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.899" end="00:25:32.099" style="s2">readily to my lips</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.979" end="00:25:35.159" style="s2">about that deep connection between the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.099" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">capacity for making meaning and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.159" end="00:25:45.690" style="s2">ability to revivify and you know empower</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:48.479" style="s2">the the entirety of one psyche yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.690" end="00:25:50.580" style="s2">please speak to that Chris because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.479" end="00:25:52.379" style="s2">think that&#39;s my experience of both you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">guys actually in and that&#39;s why I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.379" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">to talk to you I think you both have</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:26:02.429" style="s2">that drive that that kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:08.429" style="s2">monomania which which which wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.429" end="00:26:10.859" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t couldn&#39;t bear on some</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.429" end="00:26:14.639" style="s2">level to be living a life that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.859" end="00:26:18.149" style="s2">that didn&#39;t have authenticity but also a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.639" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">kind of striving towards beauty at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.149" end="00:26:20.650" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:24.250" style="s2">sorry to keep talking Chris please say</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.650" end="00:26:26.700" style="s2">something well I think I kind of hot at</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.250" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">the collar I thank you John and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.700" end="00:26:32.350" style="s2">it&#39;s definite I don&#39;t feel equals those</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:34.539" style="s2">estimations so maybe I&#39;ll just glide</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.350" end="00:26:40.630" style="s2">over them I&#39;m touched by it I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.539" end="00:26:42.940" style="s2">know what to say to it I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.630" end="00:26:45.000" style="s2">think there are some interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.940" end="00:26:47.950" style="s2">happening that I&#39;ve been noticing both</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.000" end="00:26:51.940" style="s2">personally and then in personally I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.950" end="00:26:55.450" style="s2">telling John that I had I had a strange</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.940" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">episode maybe a week ago or so where I</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.450" end="00:27:01.390" style="s2">felt there&#39;s really no other way to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:05.710" style="s2">it I just sort of felt the gulf open up</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.390" end="00:27:07.419" style="s2">beneath me and the sense of futility and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.710" end="00:27:09.400" style="s2">I and I mean I&#39;m a damn it this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.419" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">attribution I think at the time I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.400" end="00:27:14.679" style="s2">what I think now was a Mitch and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.320" end="00:27:18.400" style="s2">misattribution of any number of personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.679" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">failings or personal doubts and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.400" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">what it actually was is it had something</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:23.620" style="s2">more to do with the Supra personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:26.289" style="s2">nature of what&#39;s going on right now but</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.620" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">I was effectively enclosed by feelings</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.289" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">of futility that were tera lytic like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">torpor just something that I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:38.169" style="s2">move from I remember what I went in</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:43.870" style="s2">to do it and I just sort of lingered for</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.820" style="s2">a couple of days and then slowly over</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.870" end="00:27:48.280" style="s2">time it unwound enough for me to regain</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.419" end="00:28:06.070" style="s2">everywhere at the same time and the</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.770" end="00:28:14.140" style="s2">of virulence in general and because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.770" end="00:28:16.150" style="s2">that virulence is such an easy host for</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.140" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">meaninglessness just as the BIOS is host</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.430" end="00:28:28.260" style="s2">and it reminds me of I think it was</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.760" end="00:28:50.160" style="s2">we might hope so that with the ebbing of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.270" end="00:28:52.830" style="s2">certainty comes a renewed interest in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.160" end="00:28:57.390" style="s2">truth yes in a way that can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.830" end="00:28:59.160" style="s2">dissociate itself from the from the from</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.030" end="00:29:18.060" style="s2">of that misconception and if that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.190" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">happens enough for us to take notice</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.060" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s as that like it&#39;s as though we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.650" style="s2">it like an epistrophe we recite it over</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.650" end="00:29:29.610" style="s2">a sudden it&#39;s like a seizure and there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.610" end="00:29:33.390" style="s2">us to hear a moment of silence through</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.390" end="00:29:37.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like a Socratic aporia in a</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.920" end="00:29:42.570" style="s2">can get a foot across the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:45.630" style="s2">the aporia and hold it in place long</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.570" end="00:29:47.460" style="s2">enough to listen to listen into the</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.460" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">a&#39; then there might be something in</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:58.410" style="s2">becomes something life-affirming and</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:11.670" style="s2">um just groundlessness which is another</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.750" end="00:31:23.669" style="s2">is it could be the opportunity for</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.529" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">which just is it&#39;s a remarkable moment</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.640" end="00:36:20.799" style="s2">percent terror and so most of us are</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:22.420" style="s2">facing that right now you know many</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.799" end="00:36:23.950" style="s2">people are talking about you know</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">and on one hand they&#39;re facing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:30.910" style="s2">tremendous kind of boredom and then but</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:33.040" style="s2">then of course every now and then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.910" end="00:36:34.990" style="s2">lift their eyes towards the window and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.040" end="00:36:38.609" style="s2">they&#39;re filled with a kind of terror and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.990" end="00:36:44.290" style="s2">the thing that modifies both of those</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.609" end="00:36:46.030" style="s2">that enhances your capacity to find well</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.290" end="00:36:48.130" style="s2">meaning in the face of boredom because</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.030" end="00:36:51.369" style="s2">mortal boredom is sort of a mini meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.130" end="00:36:54.790" style="s2">crisis right and and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.369" end="00:36:57.220" style="s2">allows you to confront terror with</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.790" end="00:37:00.549" style="s2">courage is is precisely your capacity</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.549" end="00:37:05.380" style="s2">with yourself with other people and with</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.980" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">the world and so the people who I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.380" end="00:37:13.560" style="s2">are starting to sense this as not just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:15.450" style="s2">momentary</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.560" end="00:37:16.890" style="s2">disruption because that&#39;s not what it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.450" end="00:37:18.870" style="s2">we should stop pretending that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.890" end="00:37:21.750" style="s2">is this is a long-term thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.870" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">facing and the end and Jordan Hall and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.750" end="00:37:26.340" style="s2">talked about this in a couple of recent</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">videos this is not going to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.340" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">pandemic all other conditions that cause</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:32.010" style="s2">lists have not changed in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.750" end="00:37:33.480" style="s2">fact if anything they&#39;re going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.010" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">increasing we&#39;re gonna keep melting the</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.780" style="s2">the rainforests we&#39;re gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:43.190" style="s2">increasing our you know our travel and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.780" end="00:37:45.300" style="s2">our trade in grow in accelerating rates</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.190" end="00:37:48.780" style="s2">this is gonna happen again and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.300" end="00:37:50.870" style="s2">gonna happen again and so the people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.780" end="00:37:54.210" style="s2">are starting to realize that this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.870" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">could be something as game-changing</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.210" end="00:37:58.620" style="s2">could not maybe not this time but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.600" style="s2">but with increasing frequency the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.620" end="00:38:03.030" style="s2">probability of this happening is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.600" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">go up dramatically we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.030" end="00:38:06.990" style="s2">something like what the Black Plague did</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.770" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">to Europe in the Middle Ages and how it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.990" end="00:38:12.840" style="s2">completely altered the worldview the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:16.170" style="s2">sense of agency and arena that people</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.840" end="00:38:18.570" style="s2">had in a profound and irreversible</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.170" end="00:38:21.270" style="s2">manner I think we&#39;re facing that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.570" end="00:38:24.180" style="s2">like I say maybe not this pandemic but I</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.270" end="00:38:26.580" style="s2">would predict within the next one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.180" end="00:38:28.890" style="s2">what this is maybe a minor pandemic for</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.580" end="00:38:33.090" style="s2">one thing young people are not dying you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.890" end="00:38:35.610" style="s2">know absolutely terrible that elder</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.090" end="00:38:38.010" style="s2">people are dying but I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.610" end="00:38:41.130" style="s2">Spanish flu killed more people than</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.010" end="00:38:43.640" style="s2">olive oil longer or one or something so</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.130" end="00:38:48.540" style="s2">and I can having that every five years</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.640" end="00:38:49.590" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s another thing that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.540" end="00:38:51.270" style="s2">kind of interesting about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.590" end="00:38:54.120" style="s2">interesting and interesting in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.270" end="00:38:57.710" style="s2">perverse way but our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.120" end="00:39:00.270" style="s2">time which already has been affected in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.710" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">the way that Han talks about right the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.270" end="00:39:04.140" style="s2">third the aimless wizzy of time right</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">the effect that that has in our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.140" end="00:39:08.780" style="s2">is also changing as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:11.130" style="s2">that so for instance I find it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.780" end="00:39:13.110" style="s2">incredible in the proper meaning of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.130" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">term that a month ago or just over a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.110" end="00:39:18.450" style="s2">month ago I was I was traveling around</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:20.460" style="s2">and I was in Italy for maybe about 10</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.450" end="00:39:22.940" style="s2">days and then I came back you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.460" end="00:39:27.060" style="s2">through a couple of its larger airports</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.940" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">more or less carefree coronavirus had</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.060" end="00:39:30.270" style="s2">started at that point to permeate</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:34.590" style="s2">consciousness but not knowing that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.270" end="00:39:36.300" style="s2">has now and and certainly there was no</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.590" end="00:39:38.280" style="s2">ordinance to self isolate when I got</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.300" end="00:39:40.290" style="s2">back that was just over a month ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.280" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">the world has changed utterly since then</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.290" end="00:39:45.360" style="s2">and and the the fact that such change</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:49.050" style="s2">could be so comprehensive and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.360" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">instantaneous and every day every day</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.050" end="00:39:54.750" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s like there&#39;s this deepening</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:58.110" style="s2">recurrence that makes the virus feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:59.820" style="s2">cyclical like almost purgatorial right</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.110" end="00:40:01.290" style="s2">see cuz for many of us has dwelled in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.820" end="00:40:03.060" style="s2">our consciousness for only a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.290" end="00:40:06.270" style="s2">weeks and already it&#39;s starting to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.060" end="00:40:08.340" style="s2">inexorable and interminable like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.270" end="00:40:11.460" style="s2">been living with it for an eternity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.340" end="00:40:12.900" style="s2">yet it&#39;s only been a few a few weeks so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.460" end="00:40:15.930" style="s2">the way that it leaders the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.900" end="00:40:18.600" style="s2">rests on our consciousness seems not to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.930" end="00:40:20.730" style="s2">track our typical experience of time so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.600" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">I think our our ontology of passage of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.730" end="00:40:26.070" style="s2">ours is also changing because of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:29.100" style="s2">too and so you and the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.070" end="00:40:30.900" style="s2">you were talking about John of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:32.730" style="s2">transitory yielding to something</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.900" end="00:40:34.380" style="s2">indefinite I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.730" end="00:40:36.360" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite crossed that threshold yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.380" end="00:40:38.190" style="s2">but some people have and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.360" end="00:40:41.460" style="s2">when a quick critical mass crosses that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.190" end="00:40:45.260" style="s2">threshold that terror is the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.460" end="00:40:47.730" style="s2">all of all of the systems right economic</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.470" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">one that I&#39;m most apprehensive about is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.480" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">what happens when the critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:57.750" style="s2">starts to realize that this may yet be</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">an indefinite state of affairs and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.750" end="00:41:01.830" style="s2">our relationship to the world with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">fifth like the physiognomy of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.830" end="00:41:05.850" style="s2">the countenance of the world is slowly</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:07.740" style="s2">slackening it&#39;s slowly starting to look</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.850" end="00:41:09.540" style="s2">crestfallen and when that physiognomy</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.740" end="00:41:13.380" style="s2">completely goes slack and loses its</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.540" end="00:41:16.110" style="s2">confidence that&#39;s when that&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.380" end="00:41:18.270" style="s2">worried about it&#39;s like a judgment or</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.110" end="00:41:20.940" style="s2">something it&#39;s like the last judgment</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.270" end="00:41:22.980" style="s2">like I&#39;m sorry to bring that up but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.940" end="00:41:25.110" style="s2">thinking at all it&#39;s I think of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.980" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2">some people are fully prepared in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.110" end="00:41:28.500" style="s2">sense they&#39;re spiritually preparing</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:30.210" style="s2">themselves and they have been for a long</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.500" end="00:41:32.100" style="s2">time and other people will be just</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.210" end="00:41:34.490" style="s2">totally unprepared I mean some people I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.100" end="00:41:37.770" style="s2">guess there&#39;s degrees of preparedness</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.490" end="00:41:40.320" style="s2">but but but it almost feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.770" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">almost feels like this apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.320" end="00:41:44.609" style="s2">biblical moments or something and but</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.200" style="s2">notice that could notice that Antrim</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.609" end="00:41:47.880" style="s2">notice that I think it&#39;s on Paul</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.200" end="00:41:49.500" style="s2">recently I haven&#39;t seen the video yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.880" end="00:41:51.900" style="s2">Paul vindicated one on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:54.450" style="s2">this is a judgment of God oh I just saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.900" end="00:41:58.530" style="s2">it it&#39;s fantastic I don&#39;t like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.450" end="00:42:01.589" style="s2">wonderful that&#39;s really good though I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.530" end="00:42:02.790" style="s2">imposed is so insightful II yeah well he</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.589" end="00:42:06.839" style="s2">always does that that goes other</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.790" end="00:42:09.180" style="s2">question so what I wanted to say Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.839" end="00:42:12.030" style="s2">is notice how we are starting to shift</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.180" end="00:42:13.710" style="s2">and of course all of the and and and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.030" end="00:42:15.390" style="s2">should continue by the way all of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.710" end="00:42:17.369" style="s2">political socio-economic and most</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.390" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">importantly the medical language is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.369" end="00:42:21.300" style="s2">still rolling but already the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">mythological language is struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.300" end="00:42:25.349" style="s2">come to the fore and you invoked it</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:26.790" style="s2">spontaneously Andrew Paul&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.349" end="00:42:28.020" style="s2">invoked it it&#39;s part of his job to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.790" end="00:42:29.700" style="s2">invoke their thoughts and I mean that as</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.020" end="00:42:31.940" style="s2">a compliment there&#39;s any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.700" end="00:42:36.540" style="s2">appalled right and one of my concerns</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.940" end="00:42:39.210" style="s2">one of my concerns is and I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.540" end="00:42:42.869" style="s2">to this about Chris is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.210" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">pattern that could could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.869" end="00:42:50.160" style="s2">emerge in which this gives an initially</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.660" style="s2">a spike in a sense of meaningfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.160" end="00:42:54.510" style="s2">I was talking also with this with Peter</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.660" end="00:42:57.450" style="s2">Lindbergh because when you can invoke</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.510" end="00:42:59.550" style="s2">those terms seriously imagine being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.450" end="00:43:03.329" style="s2">imagine three three months ago trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.550" end="00:43:05.970" style="s2">invoke judgment God&#39;s judgment and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.329" end="00:43:07.500" style="s2">apocalypse right seriously and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.970" end="00:43:09.390" style="s2">would have their eyes would have large</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.500" end="00:43:10.859" style="s2">like me Chris and I&#39;ve seen this when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.390" end="00:43:12.869" style="s2">try to talk to people about this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.859" end="00:43:15.359" style="s2">always sort of glaze over and I know but</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.869" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">notice how now you can say that right</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.359" end="00:43:20.040" style="s2">you know it all sincerity and you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:21.780" style="s2">expect reasonably so to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.040" end="00:43:24.210" style="s2">seriously so that mythological language</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.780" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">is coming out and notice what could i</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.210" end="00:43:29.960" style="s2">khalaf i it a little bit okay it please</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:32.730" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re saying I&#39;m sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.960" end="00:43:34.829" style="s2">interrupted I didn&#39;t I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.730" end="00:43:37.410" style="s2">miss the tribute everything to you but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.829" end="00:43:39.240" style="s2">just wanted to say that you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.410" end="00:43:42.770" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s happening for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.240" end="00:43:45.930" style="s2">people is that you know the the virus</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.770" end="00:43:48.060" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s taken on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.930" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">mythological and I mean that the sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.060" end="00:43:50.849" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:52.600" style="s2">mythological role of like an Old</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.849" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">Testament deity</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.600" end="00:43:59.140" style="s2">the demonic chaotic aspect is out of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">blue unpredicted reality that will do</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.140" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">what it will do remember God&#39;s name I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:06.370" style="s2">will be what I will be right the the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.640" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">nameable thing that comes in and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.370" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">ubiquitous like some sort of spirit and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:14.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t know who who has been taken by</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">it and who hasn&#39;t and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.470" end="00:44:17.890" style="s2">falling as a judgment but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">sure what the judgment is and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.890" end="00:44:21.940" style="s2">to be potentially assuring in a new a I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:24.490" style="s2">mean these this is a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.940" end="00:44:26.950" style="s2">that you know is strongly associated</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.490" end="00:44:31.150" style="s2">with like Old Testament deities and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.950" end="00:44:34.090" style="s2">the thing about that is is the problem I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.150" end="00:44:36.430" style="s2">see with that is that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.090" end="00:44:38.710" style="s2">potential danger associated with it as</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.430" end="00:44:41.560" style="s2">the mythological meaning we try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.710" end="00:44:43.480" style="s2">to bear uh-huh yes and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.560" end="00:44:44.950" style="s2">maybe I interjected tumeric prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.480" end="00:44:46.540" style="s2">and I apologize for that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.950" end="00:44:50.650" style="s2">this is nevertheless an important point</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.540" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">to bring up well I want to say I want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.650" end="00:44:54.490" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t think I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:57.100" style="s2">suggesting this is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.490" end="00:45:00.070" style="s2">punishment of God or any of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.100" end="00:45:02.770" style="s2">nonsense like III that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.070" end="00:45:05.650" style="s2">grotesque to me as a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.770" end="00:45:10.600" style="s2">right what what it what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.650" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">more is that some people some people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.600" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">going to suffer meaninglessly and other</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:22.780" style="s2">people are going to you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:25.800" style="s2">deeper experience of life after such an</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.780" end="00:45:29.080" style="s2">event but why the term judgment then</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.800" end="00:45:31.720" style="s2">because yeah it just came to me when he</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.080" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">was talking and he and and and I was I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.720" end="00:45:36.100" style="s2">was thinking of the the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.210" end="00:45:37.750" style="s2">and I was thinking of this the final</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.100" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">days and all this sort of stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.750" end="00:45:42.430" style="s2">some people make it into the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.760" end="00:45:44.020" style="s2">heaven and other people don&#39;t so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.430" end="00:45:46.780" style="s2">not and that&#39;s not that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.020" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">existential than and and I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.780" end="00:45:51.940" style="s2">to ascribe any kind of no no theism to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:45:53.170" style="s2">that even you know no I wasn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.940" end="00:45:55.420" style="s2">do that that&#39;s why I was very careful to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.170" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">use the word myth you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.420" end="00:45:59.050" style="s2">saying is right that language came very</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:46:00.370" style="s2">naturally to you and what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.050" end="00:46:02.830" style="s2">important is exactly the point you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.370" end="00:46:03.550" style="s2">made you don&#39;t you don&#39;t hold to any of</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.830" end="00:46:06.130" style="s2">the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.550" end="00:46:08.440" style="s2">behind that language but nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.130" end="00:46:11.080" style="s2">that those images that have been woven</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.440" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">into our culture come spontaneously to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.080" end="00:46:13.990" style="s2">mind and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:16.120" style="s2">thanks Andrew I think that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.990" end="00:46:19.270" style="s2">happen for a lot of people in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.120" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">ways in a lot of circumstances and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.270" end="00:46:30.570" style="s2">is risky because that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:33.310" style="s2">thinking that can mobilize people in</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.570" end="00:46:35.820" style="s2">whatever even some pretty weird ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.310" end="00:46:40.870" style="s2">yeah yeah and so I think you can sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.820" end="00:46:44.950" style="s2">cults and cults and prophetic calls the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.870" end="00:46:47.800" style="s2">cleansing and purity and purification is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.950" end="00:46:48.460" style="s2">that language so far away from where we</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.800" end="00:46:51.130" style="s2">are now</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.460" end="00:46:53.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not that far no no it&#39;s not because</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.130" end="00:46:55.690" style="s2">I mean already into certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.620" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">social intimacy are already appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.690" end="00:47:01.540" style="s2">so actually no purity purity codes</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:04.030" style="s2">abound right now and they may well they</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.540" end="00:47:05.470" style="s2">may well persist in that direction but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.030" end="00:47:08.350" style="s2">was going to say to Andrew that I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.470" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">that the the instinct to find a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.350" end="00:47:14.350" style="s2">amount of reflexivity to see a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:16.690" style="s2">reflection of ourselves born in the form</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.690" end="00:47:23.710" style="s2">not even if we&#39;re not subscribing to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.080" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">metaphysics behind behind behind divine</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.710" end="00:47:28.990" style="s2">judgment if we&#39;re if it&#39;s done very</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.630" style="s2">carefully the fact is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.990" end="00:47:33.790" style="s2">something about the virus that is going</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.630" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">to pronounce and surface something that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.790" end="00:47:37.720" style="s2">is already implicit in our experience of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:39.550" style="s2">meaning right that&#39;s the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.720" end="00:47:42.040" style="s2">it being an analogic host for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.550" end="00:47:44.680" style="s2">meaning crisis is that it is surfacing</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.040" end="00:47:46.420" style="s2">like as a cathodic force bursting up</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.680" end="00:47:48.010" style="s2">from the unconscious if you will it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.420" end="00:47:50.470" style="s2">surfacing something that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.010" end="00:47:52.540" style="s2">present that&#39;s already present to us</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.470" end="00:47:56.110" style="s2">that&#39;s already implicitly present to us</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.540" end="00:47:57.970" style="s2">so obviously you know we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.110" end="00:48:02.410" style="s2">careful about metaphysical attributions</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.970" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">but using the virus as a dialectic way</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.410" end="00:48:09.630" style="s2">of confronting our meaninglessness is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.170" end="00:48:13.300" style="s2">where the is where the pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.630" end="00:48:17.110" style="s2">opportunity of this comes from right not</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.300" end="00:48:19.330" style="s2">simply to to wave it away to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.110" end="00:48:21.580" style="s2">to the to the you know to the random</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.330" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">cruelty of nature even if that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.580" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">is fundamentally but rather not to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:30.250" style="s2">attention to what it - what it reveals</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:32.980" style="s2">about our our the relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.250" end="00:48:35.830" style="s2">ontology right that&#39;s not and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.980" end="00:48:39.370" style="s2">a divine attribution necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.830" end="00:48:43.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s taking the emergence of it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.370" end="00:48:45.780" style="s2">be to be a symbolic affordance for</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.470" end="00:48:48.850" style="s2">communing with ourselves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.780" end="00:48:51.010" style="s2">individually and as a culture well I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.850" end="00:48:54.100" style="s2">listening to this rabbi speak about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.010" end="00:48:55.600" style="s2">and if you were if you were an Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.100" end="00:49:00.370" style="s2">rabbi and you believe that everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.600" end="00:49:03.550" style="s2">that happened was God right you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.370" end="00:49:05.800" style="s2">would think that this also is God right</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.550" end="00:49:09.190" style="s2">and this is a divine thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.800" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">happening uh-huh because the Messiah is</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.190" end="00:49:15.250" style="s2">coming and and and therefore you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:17.620" style="s2">just have to keep sort of living your</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.250" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">life in in celebration and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.620" end="00:49:22.570" style="s2">oh this is this judgment and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:24.670" style="s2">being punished or or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.570" end="00:49:27.160" style="s2">that was the feeling I got from him as</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.670" end="00:49:29.500" style="s2">like a person of faith and how they see</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.160" end="00:49:32.860" style="s2">this and that doesn&#39;t take away from any</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.500" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">of the you know the pain and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.860" end="00:49:38.980" style="s2">suffering and all that it&#39;s just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:40.120" style="s2">know if I&#39;m being very clear and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.980" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say so it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.120" end="00:49:45.580" style="s2">opposite of what John was saying about</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:46.660" style="s2">judgment is that it&#39;s not that people</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:50.170" style="s2">are being judged</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.660" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s that reality is coming in and if</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.170" end="00:49:55.510" style="s2">you were religious you would say divine</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:58.360" style="s2">reality is here you know this is divine</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:50:00.040" style="s2">reality I mean I&#39;m okay with using the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.360" end="00:50:02.500" style="s2">word divine maybe you want to see sacred</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.040" end="00:50:05.650" style="s2">but well I want to respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.500" end="00:50:07.510" style="s2">because ishi I think what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.650" end="00:50:08.830" style="s2">we face a choice and I think the word</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.510" end="00:50:10.120" style="s2">you invoked is the word that you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.830" end="00:50:12.700" style="s2">Jordan Hall and I are talking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.120" end="00:50:17.110" style="s2">about which is what does faith mean now</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.700" end="00:50:22.900" style="s2">and what does it and is there is there a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.110" end="00:50:25.240" style="s2">sense of faith that can put us into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.900" end="00:50:26.740" style="s2">the kind of situation we&#39;re in where</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:30.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about faith as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.740" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">attempt to bring about closure the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.670" end="00:50:36.280" style="s2">temp to two to reestablish and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:38.980" style="s2">Chris&#39;s sense of this word uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.280" end="00:50:42.190" style="s2">but faith is right because these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.980" end="00:50:43.600" style="s2">these are you know and this is this this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.190" end="00:50:45.130" style="s2">is the fear I was trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.600" end="00:50:47.770" style="s2">with the potential mythological</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.130" end="00:50:50.260" style="s2">resurgence of sort of a demonic deity</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.770" end="00:50:53.550" style="s2">the deities that will promise a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.260" end="00:50:58.510" style="s2">certainty and closure and purity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.550" end="00:51:01.210" style="s2">protection right and that&#39;s I take that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.510" end="00:51:03.190" style="s2">as a very serious threat and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.210" end="00:51:04.540" style="s2">of the responsibilities I feel now and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.190" end="00:51:06.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve been privileged to work with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.540" end="00:51:08.080" style="s2">with that and also with Chris but two</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.370" end="00:51:10.090" style="s2">videos with Jordan is well there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.080" end="00:51:12.850" style="s2">alternative way of understanding faith</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.090" end="00:51:16.210" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that seeking for</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.850" end="00:51:19.150" style="s2">closure and completeness and purity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.210" end="00:51:22.360" style="s2">perfection but instead is about a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.150" end="00:51:25.090" style="s2">of it&#39;s a cultivated sense of being that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.360" end="00:51:28.150" style="s2">gives you a continuity of contact with</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.090" end="00:51:31.320" style="s2">things as they unfold so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.150" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">evolve with them and you have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.320" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">the course of that so that you are</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:40.120" style="s2">sensitive to Kairos and you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:44.080" style="s2">participate in it in in with effective</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.120" end="00:51:46.450" style="s2">agency that sense of faith rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.080" end="00:51:48.070" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me this word a worship</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.450" end="00:51:50.590" style="s2">based a sense of faith which is what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.070" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">was trying I&#39;m trying to pull these two</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.590" end="00:51:56.440" style="s2">things apart I&#39;m not trying to deny</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:58.780" style="s2">anybody their worship I you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.440" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">that I don&#39;t do but what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.780" end="00:52:04.510" style="s2">say is for those of us who don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">any kind of nostalgic return a viable</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.510" end="00:52:09.430" style="s2">option and I would really really hope we</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:12.610" style="s2">don&#39;t turn back to a demonic deity</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.430" end="00:52:14.260" style="s2">answer um then we do need to re</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.610" end="00:52:17.710" style="s2">articulate we need to bring up into</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.260" end="00:52:20.080" style="s2">dialogue and into dialectic the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.710" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">faith that we started this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.080" end="00:52:24.730" style="s2">with the faith that Socrates has when he</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">says the unexamined life is not worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.730" end="00:52:29.500" style="s2">living how does he get that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:31.750" style="s2">certainty in the way that two plus two</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.500" end="00:52:33.940" style="s2">equals four it&#39;s not certainty but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.750" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">a it&#39;s a he&#39;s in he&#39;s been he&#39;s lived</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.940" end="00:52:38.140" style="s2">his life there&#39;s been continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">contact with an unfolding disclosure of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.140" end="00:52:44.260" style="s2">being that has vouchsafe to him what a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:44.980" style="s2">meaningful life is and he&#39;s sensitized</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.260" end="00:52:47.170" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.980" end="00:52:49.180" style="s2">and acquired that tastes deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.170" end="00:52:50.740" style="s2">deeper and that&#39;s the kind of faith I</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.180" end="00:52:53.730" style="s2">want to try and bring out the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.740" end="00:52:56.740" style="s2">faith that is in measurably in meshed</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.730" end="00:52:57.940" style="s2">with dia logos and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.740" end="00:53:00.310" style="s2">trying that&#39;s why I brought up that</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.940" end="00:53:02.730" style="s2">whole concern that I had isn&#39;t that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.310" end="00:53:07.420" style="s2">don&#39;t want any of that that mythology</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.730" end="00:53:10.090" style="s2">that tends to like try to total eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.420" end="00:53:12.850" style="s2">shut down and you know bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.090" end="00:53:15.130" style="s2">the closure and the the completeness and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.850" end="00:53:18.010" style="s2">the purity and the perfection but we</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.130" end="00:53:20.020" style="s2">need to resist that temptation and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.010" end="00:53:22.300" style="s2">gonna use that biblical sounding word</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.020" end="00:53:23.650" style="s2">deliberately and and the way we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.300" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">resist it and it&#39;s not just like trying</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.650" end="00:53:28.270" style="s2">to hold it off we have to beautify and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:31.480" style="s2">fall in love with if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.270" end="00:53:33.700" style="s2">Socratic faith as a contrast to that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.480" end="00:53:36.609" style="s2">that that that I don&#39;t know what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.700" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">call it that demonic faith hmm Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.609" end="00:53:41.050" style="s2">faith and demonic faith okay III think</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">the other John there&#39;s also there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.050" end="00:53:45.160" style="s2">a way in which the Socratic faith the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:46.990" style="s2">disposition of Socratic faith can</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.160" end="00:53:48.850" style="s2">carefully and perhaps not collectively</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.990" end="00:53:52.630" style="s2">but maybe on a person-to-person basis</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.850" end="00:53:56.650" style="s2">the Socratic faith can be applied as an</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.630" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">attitude an interrogative attitude to</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.650" end="00:54:03.460" style="s2">foster dialogue with the motifs with the</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.770" end="00:54:14.250" style="s2">all right great that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.690" end="00:54:14.250" style="s2">point that&#39;s an excellent point because</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:18.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no stopping the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:20.020" style="s2">perfusion of those of the of those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.520" end="00:54:22.630" style="s2">of motifs I mean they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.020" end="00:54:24.310" style="s2">baked so thoroughly into us at this</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.630" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">point that we&#39;re not going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.310" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">wave them away or turn resolutely away</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:31.630" style="s2">from them and ignore them but we are</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:34.300" style="s2">going to have to find a way to bring</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.630" end="00:54:37.810" style="s2">them into our die to enfold them into</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.300" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">the dialectical process and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.810" end="00:54:43.450" style="s2">very much in a in a sort of a union</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:44.560" style="s2">careful calibrated Union descent into</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.450" end="00:54:46.300" style="s2">the contents of the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.560" end="00:54:48.340" style="s2">unconscious right and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.300" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">what the whole process is about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.340" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know I see I see you I see</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:56.260" style="s2">you motif and I raise you you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:58.760" style="s2">let&#39;s well that&#39;s what was worried about</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.260" end="00:55:03.530" style="s2">with with just staying in this exercise</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.760" end="00:55:07.960" style="s2">mode of angst and and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.530" end="00:55:12.080" style="s2">is that we have to dive into these I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.960" end="00:55:14.810" style="s2">don&#39;t know into the symbolic world on</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.080" end="00:55:17.630" style="s2">some level and and and that takes a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.810" end="00:55:19.250" style="s2">of faith as well right yeah it does we</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.630" end="00:55:21.470" style="s2">need to know how to turn the Old</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.250" end="00:55:25.190" style="s2">Testament demon back into a Socratic day</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.470" end="00:55:27.740" style="s2">Damon Socrates had as Damon and IIIi</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.190" end="00:55:31.430" style="s2">think Chris&#39;s correction of my point is</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.740" end="00:55:33.230" style="s2">completely correct and and wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.430" end="00:55:35.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the dialectic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.230" end="00:55:38.380" style="s2">the pure dialectic that is expressing</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.540" end="00:55:40.870" style="s2">here that we can&#39;t get stuck on this one</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.380" end="00:55:43.250" style="s2">mode right Yee</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.870" end="00:55:44.990" style="s2">apologies I interrupted you again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.250" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s about how about I have when I get</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.990" end="00:55:48.770" style="s2">accept we&#39;re all interrupting each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:50.780" style="s2">it&#39;s fine I just okay I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.770" end="00:55:53.600" style="s2">pull a nose I think what Chris just did</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.780" end="00:55:55.310" style="s2">there was like not only correct I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.600" end="00:55:57.230" style="s2">an example as you pointed out Andrew I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.310" end="00:55:58.730" style="s2">think very astutely it exemplifies the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.230" end="00:56:02.930" style="s2">very thing we&#39;re trying to bring to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.730" end="00:56:03.740" style="s2">fore yeah I said there&#39;s a way Chris is</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.930" end="00:56:06.890" style="s2">right I think there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.740" end="00:56:09.910" style="s2">addressing my concern but like I say in</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.890" end="00:56:12.470" style="s2">a process of conversion and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.910" end="00:56:14.390" style="s2">transformation rather than a simple</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.470" end="00:56:16.550" style="s2">process of exclusion I was falling prey</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.390" end="00:56:19.010" style="s2">to the very thing I was criticizing I</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.550" end="00:56:20.630" style="s2">was trying to trace remove decode and</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.010" end="00:56:23.120" style="s2">keeping keeping something at bay which</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.630" end="00:56:26.150" style="s2">is exactly the wrong thing to do so well</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.120" end="00:56:27.770" style="s2">we could think of a non-theistic mode of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.150" end="00:56:30.680" style="s2">looking at the last at the Last</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.770" end="00:56:32.900" style="s2">Judgement story or any of the old</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.680" end="00:56:34.460" style="s2">stories and the Testament like but</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.900" end="00:56:36.770" style="s2">they&#39;re not there to be understood in</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.460" end="00:56:38.570" style="s2">some absolute as you say enclosed sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.770" end="00:56:40.460" style="s2">of way right they&#39;re there to be worked</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.570" end="00:56:44.410" style="s2">worked at and looked at as a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.460" end="00:56:48.890" style="s2">sort of as a transparent window into</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.410" end="00:56:51.410" style="s2">reality of some some kind the trick is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.890" end="00:56:54.650" style="s2">to keep them to I mean to keep enough of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.410" end="00:56:56.390" style="s2">the of the demonic within the demonic so</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.650" end="00:56:59.690" style="s2">that it can challenge us and shake us up</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.390" end="00:57:02.510" style="s2">because if we we need to be we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.690" end="00:57:04.250" style="s2">get into a place where we are open to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.510" end="00:57:05.540" style="s2">being surprised and shaken up because</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.250" end="00:57:10.550" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re now facing going</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.540" end="00:57:11.849" style="s2">forward in my estimation facing and and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.550" end="00:57:13.559" style="s2">if we might</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.849" end="00:57:16.200" style="s2">if we try to domesticate this with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.559" end="00:57:21.539" style="s2">demonic that&#39;s my concern but I like</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:24.359" style="s2">Chris&#39;s idea that entering into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.539" end="00:57:26.609" style="s2">of Union dialectic wicket so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.359" end="00:57:29.009" style="s2">transform it into the Socratic demonic I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.609" end="00:57:31.170" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.009" end="00:57:33.809" style="s2">insight Chris I think that&#39;s excellent</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.170" end="00:57:36.119" style="s2">I personally idea of bringing young and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.809" end="00:57:38.430" style="s2">Socrates together because Socrates on</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.119" end="00:57:41.579" style="s2">his own feels very dry to me and young</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.430" end="00:57:43.739" style="s2">young is so rich nominal logically they</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.579" end="00:57:45.450" style="s2">make they make a wonderful marriage of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.739" end="00:57:47.630" style="s2">heaven and hell well Chris and I are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.450" end="00:57:50.940" style="s2">gonna be working on a paper on that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.630" end="00:57:57.630" style="s2">actually probably probably like Monday</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.940" end="00:57:59.880" style="s2">right yeah top of mind for us no I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.630" end="00:58:01.170" style="s2">cuz I like the way that you&#39;ve um I like</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.880" end="00:58:02.910" style="s2">the way you&#39;ve you&#39;ve pinned it to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.170" end="00:58:05.220" style="s2">catchphrase John to turn the demonic to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.910" end="00:58:10.140" style="s2">the demonic I think is oh I like that as</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.220" end="00:58:14.450" style="s2">a nice pithy Turner phrasing yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.140" end="00:58:16.950" style="s2">thank you so I I was trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.450" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">turn of phrase that captured the turn of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.950" end="00:58:23.519" style="s2">your insight one thing that&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:25.979" style="s2">interesting for me to see in this</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.519" end="00:58:27.869" style="s2">process it&#39;s funny I&#39;m normally not much</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.979" end="00:58:29.430" style="s2">of a news junky but of course I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.869" end="00:58:31.769" style="s2">probably like most of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.430" end="00:58:35.999" style="s2">world I&#39;ve become one in these these</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.769" end="00:58:44.130" style="s2">last days and sorry and the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.999" end="00:58:48.239" style="s2">days I don&#39;t mean these last days maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.130" end="00:58:49.319" style="s2">that was a Freudian slip I don&#39;t but but</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.239" end="00:58:51.059" style="s2">one thing that&#39;s been really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.319" end="00:58:54.119" style="s2">and I mean we&#39;ve you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.059" end="00:58:56.579" style="s2">nauseam right now about about what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.119" end="00:58:58.680" style="s2">the diminishment of our wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.579" end="00:59:00.420" style="s2">institutions has done in a longer term</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.680" end="00:59:02.009" style="s2">for our culture but one thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.420" end="00:59:04.979" style="s2">really seeing right now I find it</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.009" end="00:59:07.229" style="s2">fascinating you know every day when the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.979" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">politicians come out of their their</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.229" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">sanctum and have to address the public</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:14.249" style="s2">and they they&#39;re forced into a position</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:16.140" style="s2">of having to give platitudes and having</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.249" end="00:59:18.479" style="s2">to give reassurance and aside from just</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.140" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">the practical and logistical messages</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.479" end="00:59:23.940" style="s2">that they have to issue they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">voiced with the demand of bringing calm</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.940" end="00:59:26.740" style="s2">and bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:28.329" style="s2">perspective now it&#39;s one thing to bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.740" end="00:59:29.470" style="s2">calm to say you know folks we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.329" end="00:59:32.589" style="s2">the best we can we&#39;ve got it under</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.470" end="00:59:35.079" style="s2">control but you can see them struggling</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.589" end="00:59:36.930" style="s2">and I actually have I have sympathy for</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.079" end="00:59:39.609" style="s2">them in this respect because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.930" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in excess</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.609" end="00:59:45.009" style="s2">of their role it&#39;s beyond their office</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:47.529" style="s2">or at least it ought to be arguably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.009" end="00:59:49.299" style="s2">beyond their office to bring perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.529" end="00:59:51.039" style="s2">to bring the philosophic perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.299" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but because we don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.039" end="00:59:55.329" style="s2">mean obviously for those beholden to a</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:58.660" style="s2">certain faith and worship you know they</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.329" end="01:00:02.859" style="s2">they round on their their clergy etc but</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.660" end="01:00:04.869" style="s2">for those for now a sizable I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.859" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">majority in the West maybe minority in</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.869" end="01:00:08.710" style="s2">the world but still a sizable minority</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">in the world who don&#39;t have those</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.710" end="01:00:14.170" style="s2">offices to turn to we&#39;re rounding on our</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:15.910" style="s2">politicians to give us some if you give</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.170" end="01:00:18.970" style="s2">us that perspective and there&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.910" end="01:00:23.049" style="s2">and they obviously don&#39;t have it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.970" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">not to say individuals among them can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.049" end="01:00:27.190" style="s2">be insightful I&#39;m sure they can but as</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:29.289" style="s2">an office they just that&#39;s not only and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.190" end="01:00:30.549" style="s2">that&#39;s not the office they hold and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.289" end="01:00:32.529" style="s2">think what we&#39;re starting to see right</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.549" end="01:00:36.130" style="s2">now is we&#39;re starting to see that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.529" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">gap the vacuum the absence of the wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.130" end="01:00:39.220" style="s2">institutions is particularly pronounced</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.529" style="s2">at a time like this</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.670" end="01:01:07.329" style="s2">we obviously look to our politicians to</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.619" end="01:01:25.299" style="s2">have to have to be the dialogues with</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.089" end="01:01:27.069" style="s2">the drama in the context Socrates right</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.299" end="01:01:29.470" style="s2">you have to remember that when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.369" end="01:01:52.819" style="s2">the context surrounding right the both</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.420" end="01:01:54.770" style="s2">the dramatic context within which</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.819" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">dialogues are set in the historical</p>

<p begin="01:01:59.780" end="01:02:03.859" style="s2">very much he&#39;s not foreign to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:07.280" style="s2">situation we are talking about</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.390" end="01:02:17.210" style="s2">threatening as we are in and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.329" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">he&#39;s again the the practice that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:47.660" end="01:02:52.970" style="s2">exemplify who we are supposed to be yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:55.490" style="s2">moment is what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.970" end="01:02:57.349" style="s2">yes and and it&#39;s supposed to be Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.490" end="01:02:59.660" style="s2">er that&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to be</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.530" end="01:03:08.150" style="s2">living because the choice really Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.530" end="01:03:09.559" style="s2">I mean and that&#39;s what came out when I</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.150" end="01:03:11.630" style="s2">was talking to ethos with us this</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.559" end="01:03:14.690" style="s2">morning right the choice really I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.630" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">initially initially first you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.690" end="01:03:19.250" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy I mean yes I get it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:21.530" style="s2">ish alia the choices live don&#39;t die yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.250" end="01:03:24.049" style="s2">but but that is not a sustaining choice</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.530" end="01:03:26.299" style="s2">the choice is ultimately are you are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.049" end="01:03:28.819" style="s2">living is it a good life you living</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.299" end="01:03:31.579" style="s2">right is it is it a life worth living</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.819" end="01:03:34.099" style="s2">III oh this is somewhat personal but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.579" end="01:03:36.710" style="s2">decided and I&#39;ve chosen and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.099" end="01:03:38.150" style="s2">committed to it I don&#39;t if it comes to a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.710" end="01:03:40.069" style="s2">point where I have to sort of start</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.150" end="01:03:42.140" style="s2">violating the fundamental principles by</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.069" end="01:03:44.660" style="s2">which I live in order to merely survive</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.140" end="01:03:48.470" style="s2">I rather and I mean this I would rather</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.660" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">die I do not am I my own survival is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.470" end="01:03:53.480" style="s2">as valuable to me</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:55.369" style="s2">the principles that I that that you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.480" end="01:03:58.070" style="s2">that I even that I&#39;ve inherited from</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.369" end="01:03:59.230" style="s2">Socrates that the unexamined life yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.070" end="01:04:03.339" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.230" end="01:04:05.750" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah yeah at some point people</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.339" end="01:04:07.820" style="s2">wanna sorry I&#39;m speaking I&#39;m over</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.750" end="01:04:11.180" style="s2">generalizing for my case uh out of hope</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.820" end="01:04:14.780" style="s2">maybe miss borne hope but I suspect that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.180" end="01:04:17.950" style="s2">many people will come to where they</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.780" end="01:04:19.190" style="s2">night might need to consider that desert</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.950" end="01:04:21.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.190" end="01:04:25.070" style="s2">mmm-hmm and if I can come back to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.800" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">judgment again if you forgive me the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.070" end="01:04:33.970" style="s2">judgment is is maybe you live maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:36.650" style="s2">you&#39;ll die but the judgment is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.970" end="01:04:39.470" style="s2">being able to say to yourself that</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.650" end="01:04:42.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve had a life worth living</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.470" end="01:04:45.320" style="s2">yes so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not an imposed</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.290" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">judgment of some helpless person uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.320" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t have any say in what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">on it&#39;s it&#39;s okay did I have judging am</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:56.119" style="s2">I good you judge it we judge ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:59.420" style="s2">right we we are judging ourselves not</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.119" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">the final judgment is is is is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.420" end="01:05:03.470" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s some gods on its from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:06.530" style="s2">depths of design you know the being</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.470" end="01:05:09.109" style="s2">whose being is in question okay and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.530" end="01:05:11.420" style="s2">ultimately have to we and we ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.109" end="01:05:12.920" style="s2">have to live that question as deeply as</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.420" end="01:05:14.630" style="s2">possible and and the way you live a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.920" end="01:05:17.660" style="s2">question is by turning it into a quest</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.630" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">nothing else you have to be open right a</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.660" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">quest is an open journey towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:26.990" style="s2">continual revelation right and and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:31.460" style="s2">just I think that what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.990" end="01:05:34.010" style="s2">once the the endurance aspect of it once</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.460" end="01:05:35.540" style="s2">the emergency aspect of this is a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.010" end="01:05:37.730" style="s2">bit more back rounded and the endurance</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.540" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">aspect comes out we have to go to have</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.730" end="01:05:43.369" style="s2">to endure for a long time I think this</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:46.099" style="s2">question about the resiliency of our of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.369" end="01:05:48.380" style="s2">the meaning of our lives is going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.099" end="01:05:50.210" style="s2">become more pronounced as Christie and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.380" end="01:05:53.990" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s the judgment</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.210" end="01:05:56.750" style="s2">that and the word in here means in</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.990" end="01:05:58.579" style="s2">French it means to make heard right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.750" end="01:06:00.829" style="s2">you&#39;re something so good point</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.579" end="01:06:01.850" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a point where we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.829" end="01:06:03.590" style="s2">made hard right</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.850" end="01:06:07.070" style="s2">that&#39;s right one level we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.590" end="01:06:09.530" style="s2">made you know strong but not hard yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.070" end="01:06:10.970" style="s2">yes well it&#39;s and yeah and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.530" end="01:06:13.730" style="s2">the storks are trying to get right again</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.970" end="01:06:17.480" style="s2">I have a meaning I&#39;ve been rereading</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.730" end="01:06:19.000" style="s2">some of releases meditations and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.480" end="01:06:21.080" style="s2">were saying at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.000" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">conversation John that well you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.080" end="01:06:24.170" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen increasingly as</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:27.370" style="s2">people are going to retreat to those</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.170" end="01:06:31.280" style="s2">relations that constitute them in most</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.370" end="01:06:33.410" style="s2">instinctively and and at one point at</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.280" end="01:06:35.330" style="s2">one point Marcus Aurelius effectively</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.410" end="01:06:36.830" style="s2">enumerates a sort of he enumerates them</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.330" end="01:06:39.020" style="s2">almost as a trinity of relations that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.830" end="01:06:41.750" style="s2">ground our sense of being right one is</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.020" end="01:06:43.100" style="s2">to the vessel that envelops us the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.750" end="01:06:46.580" style="s2">second is to the sort of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.100" end="01:06:48.890" style="s2">cause that the source of all that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.580" end="01:06:51.350" style="s2">follows all beings and then the third is</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.890" end="01:06:52.700" style="s2">to those that live alongside us and when</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.350" end="01:06:55.430" style="s2">I think about that I that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.700" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a very comprehending Trinity of</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.430" end="01:07:04.370" style="s2">relations then that we can use as a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:06.800" style="s2">of refocusing ourselves at from a ground</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.370" end="01:07:08.180" style="s2">that is that is fundamentally deeper</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.800" end="01:07:11.480" style="s2">than the one that we&#39;re used to treading</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.180" end="01:07:12.860" style="s2">on and your earlier you know the point</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.480" end="01:07:14.900" style="s2">of living within the question of being</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.860" end="01:07:17.600" style="s2">and questing after it is I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.900" end="01:07:20.840" style="s2">precisely what you meant John by this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.600" end="01:07:23.690" style="s2">the definition of faith it&#39;s not closure</p>

<p begin="01:08:48.330" end="01:08:51.750" style="s2">is wisdom in this in that sense yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.370" end="01:08:53.489" style="s2">think so because because faith is</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.339" end="01:09:59.340" style="s2">exponent power I think for me is a much</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.630" end="01:10:01.050" style="s2">handier way of understanding something</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.340" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">like a touch on it form for that very</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.050" end="01:10:05.969" style="s2">reason yeah totally totally I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.560" end="01:10:09.630" style="s2">drew an another way of bridging between</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.969" end="01:10:11.190" style="s2">the meanings of faith and wisdom is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.630" end="01:10:16.500" style="s2">the notion of reverence which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.190" end="01:10:18.890" style="s2">ability to you know to to sense the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.500" end="01:10:21.449" style="s2">relevance of that which is beyond you</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.890" end="01:10:23.880" style="s2">appropriately to be appropriately fitted</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.449" end="01:10:27.510" style="s2">to that which transcends your egocentric</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.880" end="01:10:28.900" style="s2">framework and and give it a kind work at</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.510" end="01:10:31.300" style="s2">what Iris Murdoch calls</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.900" end="01:10:33.040" style="s2">a justice of attention that you give an</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.300" end="01:10:35.260" style="s2">appropriate attention you give it the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.040" end="01:10:37.900" style="s2">attention it deserves to the degree it</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.260" end="01:10:40.150" style="s2">deserves it knowing how to do that is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.900" end="01:10:42.219" style="s2">profound kind of virtue Woodruff in fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.150" end="01:10:44.050" style="s2">argues that reverence is a missing</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.219" end="01:10:45.850" style="s2">virtue for us so I would sort of put</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.050" end="01:10:49.390" style="s2">these together as overlapping and woven</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.850" end="01:10:51.909" style="s2">you know referencing and faith when you</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.390" end="01:10:53.980" style="s2">say when you say reference what comes to</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.909" end="01:10:56.890" style="s2">my mind is worship and you hear you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.980" end="01:11:00.670" style="s2">rejecting this idea of worship and and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.890" end="01:11:02.920" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry and I I think reverence is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.670" end="01:11:04.270" style="s2">quite enough because if you&#39;re revering</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.920" end="01:11:06.580" style="s2">something you&#39;re still at a distance</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.270" end="01:11:09.190" style="s2">from it if you&#39;re worshiping something</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.580" end="01:11:10.929" style="s2">or if you find something divine if</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.190" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">you&#39;re something as sacred you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.929" end="01:11:17.560" style="s2">at a distance from it if something is</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.880" end="01:11:19.780" style="s2">divine you know then if something if</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.560" end="01:11:23.409" style="s2">it&#39;s something you worship then then</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.780" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">you&#39;re then you fall into it well so</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.409" end="01:11:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s just my minimal like that but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:30.310" style="s2">want to challenge you because I might</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:32.770" style="s2">think the appropriate the the way I want</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.310" end="01:11:34.750" style="s2">to say that is that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.770" end="01:11:36.790" style="s2">Socratic figure is actually supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.750" end="01:11:39.820" style="s2">be the symbol on the sage is supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.790" end="01:11:42.550" style="s2">be that which I mean that through which</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.820" end="01:11:45.310" style="s2">we connect those we cross that distance</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.550" end="01:11:48.190" style="s2">we don&#39;t collapse it how do we bridge a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.310" end="01:11:48.699" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.190" end="01:11:51.489" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.699" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">and what I mean by reverence I take your</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.489" end="01:11:54.730" style="s2">point well and I&#39;m not trying to invoke</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:55.870" style="s2">worship we should have worship Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.730" end="01:11:59.650" style="s2">I think that&#39;d be ridiculous and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.870" end="01:12:03.820" style="s2">find it horrifying but we worship kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.650" end="01:12:08.560" style="s2">of we worship I used to worship Leonard</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.820" end="01:12:11.290" style="s2">Cohen for example you know or my gay</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.560" end="01:12:14.770" style="s2">friend Alexander right worship Bette</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.290" end="01:12:16.750" style="s2">Midler and say she was divine you see</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.770" end="01:12:18.969" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say them I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.750" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">to say that that that there&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.969" end="01:12:22.780" style="s2">you&#39;re right we&#39;re both right in a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:25.929" style="s2">like you&#39;re right to say yes we need</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.780" end="01:12:27.580" style="s2">this sort of bridge yeah but I think the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.929" end="01:12:29.230" style="s2">bridge collapse is that at a certain</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.580" end="01:12:31.929" style="s2">point when we&#39;re when we&#39;re fully</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.230" end="01:12:34.210" style="s2">involved in what well I think we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.929" end="01:12:36.730" style="s2">internalize the sage but we should never</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.210" end="01:12:40.000" style="s2">be satisfied and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.730" end="01:12:42.310" style="s2">to get with the sense of being being a</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.000" end="01:12:42.770" style="s2">feeling like you&#39;re you you realize the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.310" end="01:12:45.470" style="s2">relative</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.770" end="01:12:48.020" style="s2">something right but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.470" end="01:12:51.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve you have you have conquered it or</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.020" end="01:12:53.510" style="s2">consumed it like you we should</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.470" end="01:12:56.650" style="s2">internalized I mean finally the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.510" end="01:12:58.880" style="s2">quote comes to mind which is really good</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.650" end="01:13:00.950" style="s2">although it presents it in a negative</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:05.150" style="s2">way is Nietzsche&#39;s quote about Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.950" end="01:13:07.640" style="s2">he said I hate Socrates he&#39;s so close to</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.150" end="01:13:10.220" style="s2">me I&#39;m always fighting him now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.640" end="01:13:13.550" style="s2">not worship but that&#39;s reverence man he</p>

<p begin="01:14:16.760" end="01:14:21.380" style="s2">of faith and reverence I&#39;m yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:23.300" style="s2">really not trying to articulate a kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.380" end="01:14:25.760" style="s2">of worship or even putting off at a</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.300" end="01:14:27.980" style="s2">distance but I don&#39;t also want an over</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.760" end="01:14:31.070" style="s2">familiarization we need to keep the sage</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.980" end="01:14:33.530" style="s2">and reality ultimately mysterious and a</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.070" end="01:14:35.330" style="s2">tip-offs for us it&#39;s like a fire if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.530" end="01:14:36.980" style="s2">get too close to it you get burned or</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.330" end="01:14:38.240" style="s2">sight and so you got it you got to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.980" end="01:14:40.940" style="s2">the Goldilocks zone where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.240" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">intimate but the fire can still burn and</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.940" end="01:14:45.170" style="s2">can still threaten you and say I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:47.060" style="s2">and this is why you know Greek myth</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.170" end="01:14:48.980" style="s2">always pears the hero myth with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.060" end="01:14:51.980" style="s2">hubris myth for all the myths of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.980" end="01:14:53.720" style="s2">hero facing the challenge right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.980" end="01:14:56.090" style="s2">the hubris myth that don&#39;t fly too close</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.720" end="01:14:56.460" style="s2">to the Sun right or don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.090" end="01:14:58.590" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.460" end="01:15:01.710" style="s2">try and ride that the the chariot of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.590" end="01:15:03.120" style="s2">Sun or don&#39;t compete with with act with</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.710" end="01:15:05.489" style="s2">with Athena for being the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.120" end="01:15:08.910" style="s2">Weaver you have all of these right</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.489" end="01:15:10.440" style="s2">hubris because the point is yes you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.910" end="01:15:13.620" style="s2">we should have we should come in too</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.440" end="01:15:15.900" style="s2">close you know contact with the gods but</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.620" end="01:15:17.880" style="s2">you know in even Plato said this you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.900" end="01:15:20.340" style="s2">know you should you to try and expect to</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.880" end="01:15:22.860" style="s2">live there all the time is is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.340" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">ridiculous concern and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.860" end="01:15:26.219" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get out with the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:27.690" style="s2">reverence that&#39;s why there&#39;s an eros is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.219" end="01:15:30.270" style="s2">that there&#39;s always the tin generis</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.690" end="01:15:32.010" style="s2">implicit in that reference because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.270" end="01:15:34.650" style="s2">precisely because they are slacks</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.010" end="01:15:37.500" style="s2">acquisition what they see in the thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.650" end="01:15:40.860" style="s2">about eros is I mean this was it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.500" end="01:15:42.780" style="s2">mixture right it&#39;s both a lack and a</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.860" end="01:15:44.489" style="s2">revelation and and Plato made it work</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.780" end="01:15:47.250" style="s2">and you know in the symposium with</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.489" end="01:15:50.430" style="s2">Socrates in eros how eros combines both</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.250" end="01:15:53.640" style="s2">of those aspects together Russ wants us</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.430" end="01:15:56.850" style="s2">to draw something into intimacy but eros</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.640" end="01:15:59.370" style="s2">should also remind us of that which we</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.850" end="01:16:01.110" style="s2">always lack and always will lie right</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.370" end="01:16:02.340" style="s2">right yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.110" end="01:16:03.719" style="s2">I guess so I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.340" end="01:16:06.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.719" end="01:16:08.940" style="s2">air us like I I I understand the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.420" end="01:16:11.660" style="s2">difference between respect and reverence</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.940" end="01:16:14.790" style="s2">as being that very difference that one</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.660" end="01:16:17.040" style="s2">contains within it the disposition of</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.790" end="01:16:17.880" style="s2">arrows and one fundamentally does not</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.040" end="01:16:19.830" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.880" end="01:16:21.930" style="s2">all right that&#39;s I think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.830" end="01:16:24.150" style="s2">what I was trying to put my finger on as</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.930" end="01:16:26.040" style="s2">long as we don&#39;t take just the current</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.150" end="01:16:29.940" style="s2">meaning of arrows no no of course not</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.040" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">of course is it there a place also for</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.940" end="01:16:35.340" style="s2">worship though I&#39;m still I&#39;m holding on</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:39.270" style="s2">to this thing because it cuz I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.340" end="01:16:41.010" style="s2">know you you you if you&#39;re you you</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.270" end="01:16:44.130" style="s2">worship let&#39;s say maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.010" end="01:16:45.900" style="s2">worship the person themselves or the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.130" end="01:16:48.300" style="s2">worship what they represent the you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.900" end="01:16:52.020" style="s2">worship the divine double or you worship</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.300" end="01:16:53.940" style="s2">them hmm I don&#39;t know I guess it depends</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.020" end="01:16:55.880" style="s2">what you mean by that word I mean I I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.940" end="01:16:58.710" style="s2">already articulated that I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.880" end="01:17:00.930" style="s2">philosophy is and this is a Socratic</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.710" end="01:17:02.910" style="s2">Maxim is bound up with the combination</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.930" end="01:17:04.290" style="s2">of a deep knowing of yourself and wonder</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.910" end="01:17:07.140" style="s2">in which yourself is called into</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.290" end="01:17:08.580" style="s2">question see you both coming engage on</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.140" end="01:17:09.719" style="s2">the project and those are course and</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.580" end="01:17:11.880" style="s2">separately bound up together</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.719" end="01:17:13.969" style="s2">you can&#39;t deeply come to know yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.880" end="01:17:17.070" style="s2">and knowing yourself is always always</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.969" end="01:17:19.320" style="s2">Socratic lee knowing the depths of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.070" end="01:17:20.910" style="s2">world that you you belong to you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.320" end="01:17:22.380" style="s2">know yourself deeply unless you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.910" end="01:17:25.260" style="s2">capable of calling it deeply into</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.380" end="01:17:30.120" style="s2">question and so wonder and awe i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.260" end="01:17:32.460" style="s2">are inseparable from this project I mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.120" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">I think Plato in fact is part of the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.460" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">you can understand his whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:40.200" style="s2">philosophical project is to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:43.110" style="s2">dialectic so that we we afford via logos</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.200" end="01:17:45.900" style="s2">and do logos will deepen wonder into awe</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.110" end="01:17:49.230" style="s2">and then ah is for its own sake because</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.900" end="01:17:50.880" style="s2">oh is that that state where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.230" end="01:17:52.860" style="s2">getting sort of the depths of ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.880" end="01:17:54.270" style="s2">and the depths of reality resonating</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.860" end="01:17:59.460" style="s2">with each other and a really powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.270" end="01:18:00.989" style="s2">and and and in its moving of its own</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.460" end="01:18:04.020" style="s2">accord it&#39;s not at the direction of our</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.989" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">egocentric projects or desires so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.020" end="01:18:10.650" style="s2">think if you mean by worship a seeking</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:13.550" style="s2">out of practices that induce ah that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.650" end="01:18:15.719" style="s2">that&#39;s fine I don&#39;t have any problem but</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.550" end="01:18:19.050" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s not what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.719" end="01:18:21.680" style="s2">worship and so I see worship is what</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.050" end="01:18:24.150" style="s2">draws you out of your ISA egocentricity</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.680" end="01:18:26.910" style="s2">towards our and then you can leave</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.150" end="01:18:29.460" style="s2">behind the worship once you&#39;ve arrived</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.910" end="01:18:32.130" style="s2">at the off but it&#39;s but it&#39;s a stage</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.460" end="01:18:34.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it could be and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.130" end="01:18:36.840" style="s2">very Buddhist so and and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.980" end="01:18:38.820" style="s2">remain open to this and see I&#39;m even</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.840" end="01:18:40.170" style="s2">crossing my arms instinctively because I</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.820" end="01:18:41.489" style="s2">go up I was brought about some</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.170" end="01:18:42.719" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian and worship</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.489" end="01:18:47.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t meet what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.719" end="01:18:47.750" style="s2">right now at all mmm-hmm means a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.140" end="01:18:52.940" style="s2">fruitless and I mean that deeply a</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.820" end="01:18:55.260" style="s2">fruitless kind of self-sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.940" end="01:18:58.590" style="s2">towards a God who seems to be nothing</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.260" end="01:19:01.050" style="s2">but a a consummate narcissist who needs</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.590" end="01:19:03.300" style="s2">endless praise and devotion while</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.050" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">telling us that we should never ever be</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.300" end="01:19:07.260" style="s2">self-centered we should be like him but</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:09.300" style="s2">what he seems to need more than anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.260" end="01:19:11.219" style="s2">else is constant praise adoration and</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.300" end="01:19:13.260" style="s2">worship and being put at number one no</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.219" end="01:19:15.450" style="s2">matter what&#39;s happening at all costs in</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.260" end="01:19:18.180" style="s2">all endeavors and I mean and I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.450" end="01:19:19.950" style="s2">see and I feel privileged to have</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.180" end="01:19:22.290" style="s2">experienced this or in a negative sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.950" end="01:19:25.770" style="s2">of privilege because</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.290" end="01:19:29.790" style="s2">that that I saw no good come out of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.770" end="01:19:33.270" style="s2">in people&#39;s lives and it definitely hurt</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.790" end="01:19:34.920" style="s2">and traumatized me in in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.270" end="01:19:38.430" style="s2">and if that&#39;s what you mean by worship</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.920" end="01:19:42.930" style="s2">then I yeah I I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.430" end="01:19:44.970" style="s2">I mean by worship is that many people do</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.930" end="01:19:47.220" style="s2">mean that by worship many people sure do</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.970" end="01:19:47.880" style="s2">I agree with you yeah mmm I take your</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.220" end="01:19:50.040" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.880" end="01:19:52.110" style="s2">I&#39;m sensing a lot of congruence between</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.040" end="01:19:53.130" style="s2">what you&#39;re both saying I say I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.110" end="01:19:54.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.130" end="01:19:57.240" style="s2">terminological tension but I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.750" end="01:19:58.500" style="s2">fundamentally what I&#39;m what I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.240" end="01:20:00.390" style="s2">from you Andrew is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.500" end="01:20:02.220" style="s2">talking about with what you&#39;re meaning</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.390" end="01:20:03.840" style="s2">by where it&#39;s correct me if I&#39;m wrong I</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.220" end="01:20:05.910" style="s2">think what you mean by worship is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.840" end="01:20:10.770" style="s2">particular kind of relationship that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.910" end="01:20:11.940" style="s2">person has with the symbol and and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.770" end="01:20:13.800" style="s2">saying that the the particular</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.940" end="01:20:17.520" style="s2">relationship that the person has with</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.800" end="01:20:20.760" style="s2">symbol is precisely is precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.520" end="01:20:22.740" style="s2">transfigures the entire ritual into some</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.760" end="01:20:24.930" style="s2">of the features that John is describing</p>

<p begin="01:20:24.930" end="01:20:28.590" style="s2">talking about it in terms of this the</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.400" end="01:20:29.970" style="s2">interpersonal connection between the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.590" end="01:20:33.000" style="s2">individual and the symbol that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.970" end="01:20:35.250" style="s2">attending to as opposed to the uniform</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.000" end="01:20:36.420" style="s2">the perceptual opening that&#39;s evoked as</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.250" end="01:20:38.310" style="s2">a consequence of that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.420" end="01:20:40.050" style="s2">fundamentally they cannot collapse into</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.310" end="01:20:41.820" style="s2">the same praxis and that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.050" end="01:20:43.860" style="s2">fundamentally the two of you were</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.820" end="01:20:46.410" style="s2">talking about is it&#39;s not exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.860" end="01:20:47.490" style="s2">same at least continues I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.410" end="01:20:49.230" style="s2">right I think that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.490" end="01:20:50.790" style="s2">putting it and maybe we could</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.230" end="01:20:54.180" style="s2">distinguish it this way there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.790" end="01:20:57.060" style="s2">idolatrous sense of worship and there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.180" end="01:20:59.130" style="s2">an iconic not in person in a carbon</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.060" end="01:21:00.660" style="s2">sense I was thinking about I can&#39;t I can</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.130" end="01:21:04.020" style="s2">eyes him like how you would worship an</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.660" end="01:21:06.090" style="s2">icon if you were a Christian Orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.020" end="01:21:08.550" style="s2">person you had worship this icon as</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.090" end="01:21:10.380" style="s2">being as being a symbol of the divine or</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.550" end="01:21:11.880" style="s2">yeah and that and that&#39;s exactly what I</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.380" end="01:21:13.770" style="s2">meant by the sage it brings you close</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.880" end="01:21:15.780" style="s2">but also beckons you beyond and he never</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.770" end="01:21:18.450" style="s2">allows you to it brings you close but</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.780" end="01:21:20.250" style="s2">never allows you to enclose and and if</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.450" end="01:21:22.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what you mean by worship and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.250" end="01:21:24.300" style="s2">think Chris is right Andrew I think he</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.470" end="01:21:27.510" style="s2">pointing to the convergence is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.300" end="01:21:29.100" style="s2">right then I think that is a central</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.510" end="01:21:30.450" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.100" end="01:21:34.230" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about Socratic faith and</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.450" end="01:21:35.250" style="s2">what&#39;s happening that that what can</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.230" end="01:21:37.710" style="s2">emerge when</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.250" end="01:21:40.200" style="s2">emerges there&#39;s a deep reverence it can</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.710" end="01:21:42.150" style="s2">be are inspiring and it may even become</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.200" end="01:21:44.130" style="s2">symbolic in that worshipful way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.150" end="01:21:45.810" style="s2">talking about but what it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.130" end="01:21:48.240" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s what&#39;s clear Plato</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.810" end="01:21:50.220" style="s2">continually undermines and what I had</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.240" end="01:21:51.690" style="s2">the invective of from my own experiences</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.220" end="01:21:56.580" style="s2">it should never become idolatrous</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.690" end="01:21:58.170" style="s2">worship I also I also filled yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.580" end="01:22:01.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s well said John I also feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.170" end="01:22:02.880" style="s2">I also feel compelled to notice that for</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.110" end="01:22:05.880" style="s2">some even though your particular</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.880" end="01:22:08.580" style="s2">experience of ritual a Dori the ritual</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.880" end="01:22:10.620" style="s2">adoration of Christ was idolatrous in</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.580" end="01:22:14.520" style="s2">the way that it was forced on you for</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.620" end="01:22:15.720" style="s2">for many Christians and I can&#39;t trap</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.520" end="01:22:18.870" style="s2">myself among them but for many</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.720" end="01:22:20.430" style="s2">Christians I and I trust this implicitly</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.870" end="01:22:23.640" style="s2">because I know some of them very very</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.430" end="01:22:27.540" style="s2">thoughtfully for for some Christians the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.640" end="01:22:30.750" style="s2">adoration is an iconic adoration and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.540" end="01:22:32.460" style="s2">way that we&#39;ve just described I I envy</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.750" end="01:22:34.950" style="s2">them that but many of them many of them</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.460" end="01:22:37.020" style="s2">have that experience for genuinely an</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.950" end="01:22:38.940" style="s2">example he recorded know what I have the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.020" end="01:22:42.870" style="s2">opposite experience to John you know I</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.940" end="01:22:45.540" style="s2">grew up without religion of any kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.870" end="01:22:47.430" style="s2">right so everything you know I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.540" end="01:22:51.900" style="s2">very very attracted to the esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.430" end="01:22:55.080" style="s2">aspects of religion which lead into</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.900" end="01:22:57.360" style="s2">mystery and not into this you know and</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.080" end="01:22:59.730" style="s2">and I&#39;m very I&#39;m kind of critical about</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:02.220" style="s2">the clinical Buddhists sort of where</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.730" end="01:23:06.210" style="s2">aspect of Buddhism which doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.220" end="01:23:08.940" style="s2">worship which is is very let&#39;s say dry</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.210" end="01:23:13.980" style="s2">and pseudo-scientific and psychological</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.940" end="01:23:15.900" style="s2">and whereas I whereas and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.980" end="01:23:18.540" style="s2">attracted the Orthodox tradition because</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.900" end="01:23:20.370" style="s2">because they there&#39;s this passionate</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.540" end="01:23:24.270" style="s2">aspect to it but I can I can definitely</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.370" end="01:23:28.260" style="s2">see how that can can go dark and and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.270" end="01:23:32.159" style="s2">can it can be demonic and the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.260" end="01:23:33.960" style="s2">of wisdom of any kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.159" end="01:23:36.840" style="s2">but see what see what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.960" end="01:23:38.940" style="s2">see how I mean look what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.840" end="01:23:40.949" style="s2">between the three of us yeah right the</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.940" end="01:23:42.330" style="s2">deal logos the third factors emerging</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.949" end="01:23:45.270" style="s2">none of us could have got here on our</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.330" end="01:23:47.190" style="s2">own it&#39;s leading us in a way I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.270" end="01:23:49.650" style="s2">like things are being disclosed in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.190" end="01:23:52.020" style="s2">powerful way and we&#39;re seeing how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.650" end="01:23:55.080" style="s2">inevitably being led into the depths of</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.020" end="01:23:57.120" style="s2">religio and its in its deep relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.080" end="01:23:58.980" style="s2">although not its identity with religion</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.120" end="01:24:00.989" style="s2">as we&#39;re trying to grapple with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.980" end="01:24:03.239" style="s2">situation that&#39;s confronting us I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.989" end="01:24:06.210" style="s2">this is exactly yeah Chris and I are</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.239" end="01:24:08.820" style="s2">talking about yeah I and I love how what</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.210" end="01:24:10.739" style="s2">what I am what I find I agree John and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.820" end="01:24:12.239" style="s2">think that one way I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.739" end="01:24:16.080" style="s2">Corbin puts it this way you currently</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.239" end="01:24:18.420" style="s2">find wrong but I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.080" end="01:24:20.250" style="s2">ways in which he phrases the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.420" end="01:24:22.500" style="s2">relationship of the individual to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.250" end="01:24:25.080" style="s2">divine angel is that we are subjects of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.500" end="01:24:26.730" style="s2">the verb that is the divine angel and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.080" end="01:24:31.290" style="s2">think that in the throes of diello go</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.730" end="01:24:34.770" style="s2">like this I feel subject to a verb from</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.290" end="01:24:36.600" style="s2">without in very much that way and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.770" end="01:24:39.239" style="s2">you notice how your gesture was</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.600" end="01:24:42.300" style="s2">automatic yeah I feel like I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.239" end="01:24:46.010" style="s2">lifted up yes yeah and I&#39;d be doing this</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.300" end="01:24:48.290" style="s2">too like that being lifted up that uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.010" end="01:24:51.510" style="s2">this is the point though Andrew</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.290" end="01:24:54.540" style="s2">mentioned notice how the horizontal is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.510" end="01:24:57.330" style="s2">meshed inexorably with the vertical with</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.540" end="01:24:58.679" style="s2">a very now the two are just deeply</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.330" end="01:25:01.320" style="s2">interwoven and on all we can</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.679" end="01:25:02.100" style="s2">analytically talk about them as distinct</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.320" end="01:25:03.690" style="s2">their dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.100" end="01:25:05.070" style="s2">notice how phenomenologically and</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.690" end="01:25:07.590" style="s2">functionally they are so interwoven</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.070" end="01:25:10.620" style="s2">together yes and then our relationship</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.590" end="01:25:12.780" style="s2">to them to add the another dimension to</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.620" end="01:25:14.219" style="s2">that that that our relationship with our</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.780" end="01:25:15.900" style="s2">relationship right now with the passage</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.219" end="01:25:18.690" style="s2">of time also changes yes when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.900" end="01:25:21.270" style="s2">deeply immersed in us yeah and then also</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.690" end="01:25:22.500" style="s2">to add the next this conversation notice</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.270" end="01:25:24.540" style="s2">how much I&#39;ve been alluding to other</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.500" end="01:25:26.190" style="s2">conversations and you Andrew you and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.540" end="01:25:28.590" style="s2">have had conversations and Andrew you</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.190" end="01:25:30.960" style="s2">and Chris are like so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.590" end="01:25:33.870" style="s2">where this particular moment of</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:36.060" style="s2">dialectic is sitting in this network of</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.870" end="01:25:37.800" style="s2">all these other conversations that have</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.060" end="01:25:39.090" style="s2">this kind of meta dialogue going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.800" end="01:25:40.980" style="s2">between them because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.090" end="01:25:43.020" style="s2">informing and constraining each other</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.980" end="01:25:45.659" style="s2">right now right here right now and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.020" end="01:25:47.699" style="s2">this dialogue will go into that network</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.659" end="01:25:49.920" style="s2">of constraints on further conversations</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.699" end="01:25:51.239" style="s2">mm-hmm right right like they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.920" end="01:25:52.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all they&#39;re all within the</p>

<p begin="01:26:46.860" end="01:26:52.739" style="s2">reflects its holographic in that each</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.650" end="01:26:55.620" style="s2">the individuality of each is just how it</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.739" end="01:26:59.130" style="s2">determinately reflects all the others so</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.620" end="01:27:00.960" style="s2">there&#39;s each one is is right so this</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.130" end="01:27:05.250" style="s2">jewel is just the reflection of all the</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.960" end="01:27:07.830" style="s2">other jewels right okay okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.250" end="01:27:09.870" style="s2">like whiteheads notion of you know every</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.830" end="01:27:11.550" style="s2">moment is the entire collapse of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.870" end="01:27:13.380" style="s2">universe so the entire universe is</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.550" end="01:27:14.909" style="s2">collapsing to that moment but that</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.380" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">moment is included in the collapse</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.909" end="01:27:19.050" style="s2">towards this moment and so everything</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:21.000" style="s2">it&#39;s really everything is mutually the</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.050" end="01:27:23.989" style="s2">toe Hannah yeah well yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.000" end="01:27:27.060" style="s2">that&#39;s then Platonists clearly</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.989" end="01:27:29.340" style="s2">explicitly articulates that also of how</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.060" end="01:27:32.429" style="s2">the forms are related to each other</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.340" end="01:27:34.639" style="s2">within noose no that&#39;s cool yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.429" end="01:27:37.260" style="s2">whatever what a beautifully woven</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.639" end="01:27:38.969" style="s2">metaphor well what&#39;s cool for me is I</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.260" end="01:27:41.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of this holographic</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.969" end="01:27:43.320" style="s2">deep learning because what it is is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.400" end="01:27:45.360" style="s2">in this holographic multi-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.320" end="01:27:47.250" style="s2">compression and variation function</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.360" end="01:27:49.050" style="s2">everything is compressing and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.250" end="01:27:51.240" style="s2">everything is varying but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.050" end="01:27:53.310" style="s2">sort of like in in a neural networks one</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.240" end="01:27:54.900" style="s2">oppression one variation everything is</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.310" end="01:27:56.820" style="s2">compressing and burying for everything</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.900" end="01:27:59.190" style="s2">else and so reality is like this an</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.820" end="01:28:01.770" style="s2">amazing amazing holographic deep</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.190" end="01:28:04.080" style="s2">learning network yeah right well I was</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.770" end="01:28:07.890" style="s2">also thinking about to be just slightly</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.080" end="01:28:09.630" style="s2">more prosaic about about Zack when we</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.890" end="01:28:13.590" style="s2">talked with Zack he said that this was a</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.630" end="01:28:15.770" style="s2">jam and there were three of us yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.590" end="01:28:18.840" style="s2">you know we started I started off having</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.770" end="01:28:20.550" style="s2">dyad like conversations with with John</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.840" end="01:28:25.530" style="s2">and then the conversation and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.550" end="01:28:27.560" style="s2">become a triad it&#39;s become a like the</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.530" end="01:28:30.900" style="s2">Jimi Hendrix Experience or something</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.560" end="01:28:34.260" style="s2">well you know I being the drummer and</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.900" end="01:28:38.520" style="s2">I&#39;m a bit wild and and and and John is</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.260" end="01:28:40.590" style="s2">is sort of keeping us together and very</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.520" end="01:28:44.580" style="s2">passionate and chris is maybe the bass</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.590" end="01:28:46.590" style="s2">player it seems like it seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.580" end="01:28:47.910" style="s2">kind of musicality and and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.590" end="01:28:49.890" style="s2">also what you&#39;re talking about when you</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.910" end="01:28:52.080" style="s2">talk totally that&#39;s Christmas planning</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.890" end="01:28:55.260" style="s2">yeah yeah this brought that metaphor to</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.080" end="01:28:56.760" style="s2">the chapter we wrote in he played with</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.260" end="01:28:58.770" style="s2">the musicality and me well Chris you</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.760" end="01:29:00.210" style="s2">talked about it you know the in concert</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.770" end="01:29:02.370" style="s2">metaphor that you that you made</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.210" end="01:29:05.850" style="s2">throughout the chapter we just wrote</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.370" end="01:29:08.550" style="s2">yeah yeah which is ironic because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.850" end="01:29:10.980" style="s2">I&#39;m in in my tactile life I&#39;m not at all</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.550" end="01:29:13.170" style="s2">very musical but it seemed to me that</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.980" end="01:29:16.140" style="s2">there was no more there was no more</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.170" end="01:29:19.590" style="s2">perfect analogy to play into the process</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.140" end="01:29:21.360" style="s2">because because because the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.590" end="01:29:23.250" style="s2">being able to I mean because it because</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.360" end="01:29:25.230" style="s2">it because it both because it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.250" end="01:29:27.540" style="s2">concentrated and distributed at the same</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.230" end="01:29:29.220" style="s2">time because a melody can recur and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.540" end="01:29:30.840" style="s2">because a melody can transform and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.220" end="01:29:37.650" style="s2">melody can be present in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.840" end="01:29:40.230" style="s2">different ways yeah it&#39;s just a most</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.650" end="01:29:42.240" style="s2">perfect ahead John I just wanted that to</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.230" end="01:29:43.770" style="s2">the metaphor now Andrew your metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.240" end="01:29:46.170" style="s2">you know in jamming you have to pick up</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.770" end="01:29:47.760" style="s2">on it you have to pick up on it but you</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.170" end="01:29:49.230" style="s2">have to get you have to get pick up on</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.760" end="01:29:52.740" style="s2">it and get clear up in it</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.230" end="01:29:55.410" style="s2">right and if you try and hold on to it</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.740" end="01:29:57.030" style="s2">too long you destroy it this is back</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.410" end="01:29:59.580" style="s2">again to this fake the sense of faith</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.030" end="01:30:00.750" style="s2">you know you know you&#39;re getting picked</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.580" end="01:30:02.700" style="s2">up they&#39;re on it you&#39;re you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.750" end="01:30:04.789" style="s2">continuity of contact you can continue</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.700" end="01:30:07.369" style="s2">to play the serious</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.789" end="01:30:09.530" style="s2">play and that&#39;s again the Socratic faith</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.369" end="01:30:11.719" style="s2">so we could actually add that to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.530" end="01:30:12.349" style="s2">two-year metaphor Chris I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.719" end="01:30:15.229" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.349" end="01:30:17.929" style="s2">notice that it starts off much more</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.229" end="01:30:20.419" style="s2">intellectual or more prosaic and a bit</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.929" end="01:30:22.879" style="s2">awkward and and in many directions and</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.419" end="01:30:25.369" style="s2">then we build towards this kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.879" end="01:30:27.469" style="s2">penny of this vector it seems to happen</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.369" end="01:30:29.119" style="s2">in all these kind of conversations least</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.469" end="01:30:34.129" style="s2">ones I&#39;ve been having we build towards</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.119" end="01:30:36.379" style="s2">this we build up towards you know an</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.129" end="01:30:36.829" style="s2">insight and a static insight of some</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.379" end="01:30:38.929" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.829" end="01:30:40.339" style="s2">yep and I think that&#39;s the third factor</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.929" end="01:30:41.869" style="s2">that we were talking about that third</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.339" end="01:30:45.919" style="s2">factor where it takes on a life of its</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.869" end="01:30:47.510" style="s2">own and it instead of you pushing the</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.919" end="01:30:49.309" style="s2">conversation forward it takes on a life</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.510" end="01:30:51.379" style="s2">of its own and everybody has drawn up</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.309" end="01:30:53.510" style="s2">together forward in it that&#39;s the third</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.379" end="01:30:56.299" style="s2">factor it&#39;s like it&#39;s the spirit of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.510" end="01:30:58.129" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s the Geist yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.299" end="01:31:00.530" style="s2">that you&#39;re taught you&#39;re spoken by the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.129" end="01:31:05.689" style="s2">conversation so transected yes detective</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.530" end="01:31:08.629" style="s2">sensation exactly this is why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.689" end="01:31:11.299" style="s2">logos and dialectic are so central not</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.629" end="01:31:13.760" style="s2">only to you know the the ongoing issue</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.299" end="01:31:17.899" style="s2">of the meeting crisis but in turn for</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.760" end="01:31:21.549" style="s2">giving people the place and the presence</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.899" end="01:31:26.239" style="s2">and the and and the in the interlocutors</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.549" end="01:31:28.489" style="s2">to cultivate the kinds of responses we</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.239" end="01:31:29.599" style="s2">need right now in the face of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.489" end="01:31:31.609" style="s2">facing again</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.599" end="01:31:34.539" style="s2">Socrates was in Athens during the plague</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.609" end="01:31:37.099" style="s2">and while it was literally under siege</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.539" end="01:31:42.319" style="s2">so we all have to be Socrates you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.099" end="01:31:45.019" style="s2">well yeah in a way anyway we all else we</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.319" end="01:31:47.869" style="s2">only in a way I&#39;m sorry that felt very</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.019" end="01:31:49.519" style="s2">banal actually a banal statement it felt</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.869" end="01:31:51.829" style="s2">like a oh no I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.519" end="01:31:54.559" style="s2">well he&#39;s even now advertising jingle or</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.829" end="01:31:56.239" style="s2">something well yeah I don&#39;t want it to</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.559" end="01:31:57.169" style="s2">become trivialize but I want I would</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.239" end="01:31:58.879" style="s2">want to say we all have to become</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.169" end="01:32:00.859" style="s2">Socrates but also in the way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.879" end="01:32:03.829" style="s2">all have to become Siddhartha and we all</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.859" end="01:32:05.899" style="s2">have to become loud say and perhaps if</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.829" end="01:32:06.919" style="s2">it&#39;s not too sacrilegious given my</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.899" end="01:32:09.769" style="s2">previous invective</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.919" end="01:32:11.629" style="s2">you also have to become Jesus I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.769" end="01:32:13.789" style="s2">have to recover Socratic wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.629" end="01:32:15.979" style="s2">faith we have to recover that Jesus is</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.789" end="01:32:17.110" style="s2">agape we have to recover loud says--</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.979" end="01:32:20.230" style="s2">flow we have</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.110" end="01:32:22.659" style="s2">recover you know sit hardness capacity</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.230" end="01:32:24.639" style="s2">for profound transformative insight we</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.659" end="01:32:27.610" style="s2">need all of these now we needed all of</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.639" end="01:32:29.560" style="s2">these and if art you know if our musings</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.610" end="01:32:31.869" style="s2">about this stand outside of literalism</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.560" end="01:32:33.460" style="s2">which of course they do then then I</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.869" end="01:32:37.239" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.460" end="01:32:38.650" style="s2">blaspheming to say that that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.239" end="01:32:40.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.650" end="01:32:42.280" style="s2">trivial statement and your to say that</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.179" end="01:32:44.770" style="s2">we have to be Socrates because the way</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.280" end="01:32:46.810" style="s2">that Socrates is Socrates you know I</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.770" end="01:32:49.210" style="s2">trust you&#39;ll both take this in the in</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.810" end="01:32:53.110" style="s2">the intended meaning even Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.210" end="01:32:54.790" style="s2">not Socrates yes yes so yeah in a way</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.110" end="01:32:56.530" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s precisely right we have to</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.790" end="01:32:59.710" style="s2">be Socrates in the way that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.530" end="01:33:01.780" style="s2">and is not Socrates precisely this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.710" end="01:33:04.480" style="s2">never beyond himself I hope that&#39;s not I</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.780" end="01:33:06.400" style="s2">hope that&#39;s not you reckon so that</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.480" end="01:33:07.929" style="s2">himself if he said what he asked whether</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.400" end="01:33:12.100" style="s2">he said you know I&#39;ve given you a</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.929" end="01:33:15.429" style="s2">Socrates more beautiful yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.100" end="01:33:17.500" style="s2">right the historical Socrates because he</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.429" end="01:33:19.989" style="s2">was much more concerned to represent</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.500" end="01:33:23.280" style="s2">what Socrates lived for than what</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.989" end="01:33:26.020" style="s2">Socrates was historically you know again</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.280" end="01:33:29.440" style="s2">instead of pursuing this to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.020" end="01:33:31.780" style="s2">historical certainty of Socrates Plato</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.440" end="01:33:34.330" style="s2">was much more interested in getting us</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.780" end="01:33:36.790" style="s2">to confront the truth of Socrates or the</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.330" end="01:33:39.520" style="s2">as a form of Socrates does it work there</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.790" end="01:33:42.310" style="s2">we go Andrew the essence the form and</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.520" end="01:33:43.989" style="s2">the truth of satis yes and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.310" end="01:33:46.270" style="s2">end this I was also thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.989" end="01:33:48.790" style="s2">meaning of you know Carl Jung talks</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.270" end="01:33:51.159" style="s2">about imitation of Christ is is not</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.790" end="01:33:58.420" style="s2">imitating Christ&#39;s life but it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.159" end="01:34:01.300" style="s2">becoming more truly not ourselves but</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.420" end="01:34:03.940" style="s2">our I guess the I guess our divine</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.300" end="01:34:06.520" style="s2">double like you keep using that if</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.940" end="01:34:08.139" style="s2">bringing that that was it the my last</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.520" end="01:34:10.389" style="s2">question and that keeps coming up at the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.139" end="01:34:12.699" style="s2">end of these conversations as well this</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.389" end="01:34:15.010" style="s2">notion of the divine double which I</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.699" end="01:34:17.980" style="s2">talked about with Zack as well and and</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.010" end="01:34:21.969" style="s2">the divine double being our potential</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.980" end="01:34:24.330" style="s2">and our plurality and it&#39;s enacted now I</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.969" end="01:34:28.270" style="s2">mean it&#39;s simple it&#39;s symbolically</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.330" end="01:34:31.320" style="s2">already active in how it calls us forth</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.270" end="01:34:35.980" style="s2">from our current self yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.320" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">and yeah I think the I mean part of what</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.980" end="01:34:39.790" style="s2">I want to work on with Chris&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.600" end="01:34:42.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep connection between wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.790" end="01:34:45.910" style="s2">the sense of faith Socratic faith and</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.600" end="01:34:48.400" style="s2">being in the correct kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.910" end="01:34:51.340" style="s2">connectedness and identity with your</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.400" end="01:34:53.970" style="s2">sacred second self which which also is</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.340" end="01:34:56.080" style="s2">more or less which is which is very</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.970" end="01:34:59.980" style="s2">convergent with the idea of being in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.080" end="01:35:01.780" style="s2">right relation to your whole self in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.980" end="01:35:03.910" style="s2">Union sense of self right to find the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.780" end="01:35:05.740" style="s2">midpoint of personality that Jung talks</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.910" end="01:35:08.050" style="s2">about to be in relation with yourself</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.740" end="01:35:12.220" style="s2">such that you&#39;re you&#39;re you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.050" end="01:35:14.980" style="s2">reciprocal and equilibrated third spirit</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.220" end="01:35:17.920" style="s2">and transfer or I might say translucent</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.980" end="01:35:19.690" style="s2">loose distance distanced in just the</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.920" end="01:35:23.770" style="s2">right way that you are you are you are</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.690" end="01:35:25.510" style="s2">you are not susceptible to to two</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.770" end="01:35:30.010" style="s2">pathologies of inflation and overt</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.510" end="01:35:32.520" style="s2">identification or God likeness but but</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.010" end="01:35:35.740" style="s2">that you are that you are positioned</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.520" end="01:35:37.600" style="s2">you&#39;re positioned you know in proportion</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.740" end="01:35:39.850" style="s2">to your to your psychic potential</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.600" end="01:35:42.280" style="s2">properly and I think that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.850" end="01:35:45.610" style="s2">very much very if not I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.280" end="01:35:48.130" style="s2">make an argument from exact identity</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.610" end="01:35:51.040" style="s2">here but I think I think the convergence</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.130" end="01:35:52.630" style="s2">is pretty unmistakable yeah I would</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.040" end="01:35:58.600" style="s2">agree with that I would agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.630" end="01:36:01.210" style="s2">mmm-hmm I should get going soon so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.600" end="01:36:03.640" style="s2">it it&#39;s just this feels like what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.210" end="01:36:05.320" style="s2">also come to a culmination point in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.640" end="01:36:09.490" style="s2">conversation mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.320" end="01:36:12.760" style="s2">yeah yeah what do you think does anybody</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.490" end="01:36:15.820" style="s2">else want to say anything or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.760" end="01:36:17.440" style="s2">want to foreclose but I like I said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.820" end="01:36:19.780" style="s2">already sort of half an hour past where</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.440" end="01:36:22.660" style="s2">I said I would yeah well I wouldn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.780" end="01:36:24.640" style="s2">this I I would never end this it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.660" end="01:36:27.880" style="s2">a great pleasure for me and I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.640" end="01:36:30.340" style="s2">it so much but but there has to be an</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.880" end="01:36:32.020" style="s2">end somewhere so well it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.340" end="01:36:34.150" style="s2">only things I like from Sartre you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.020" end="01:36:35.620" style="s2">you said you never he talked about books</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.150" end="01:36:39.370" style="s2">he said you never finished them you just</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.620" end="01:36:43.390" style="s2">abandon them I don&#39;t think just abandon</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.370" end="01:36:44.739" style="s2">them because we have other commerce the</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.390" end="01:36:46.210" style="s2">conversation will continue</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.739" end="01:36:47.920" style="s2">well that&#39;s part of what we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.210" end="01:36:52.030" style="s2">about towards the end at Austin</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.920" end="01:36:55.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s what&#39;s moving forward to</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.030" end="01:36:56.710" style="s2">whatever it will become and I also there</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.120" end="01:37:00.940" style="s2">was one point in their conversation</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.710" end="01:37:03.520" style="s2">where I felt this is so important</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.940" end="01:37:06.550" style="s2">I just wish like one person out there</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.520" end="01:37:08.860" style="s2">could hear it there&#39;s just I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.550" end="01:37:10.030" style="s2">remember what the point was but but</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.860" end="01:37:12.310" style="s2">there&#39;s something really really</p>

<p begin="01:37:15.580" end="01:37:24.630" style="s2">getting a little little piece of that</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.380" end="01:37:26.980" style="s2">meaning could change everything I mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.630" end="01:37:28.900" style="s2">does that make any sense am I being too</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.980" end="01:37:30.700" style="s2">dramatic here no no no I think that&#39;s I</p>
