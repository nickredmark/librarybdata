<p begin="00:01:51.620" end="00:01:57.040" style="s2">keep sticking this out it&#39;s partial</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.860" end="00:02:00.530" style="s2">therapy and it&#39;s also confirmation that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.040" end="00:02:02.740" style="s2">I think I&#39;m not the only one who sees</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.530" end="00:02:05.210" style="s2">some of the things I&#39;m talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.740" end="00:02:07.850" style="s2">usually I give you a primer about what</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.210" end="00:02:09.530" style="s2">the episode is gonna be about but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.850" end="00:02:10.220" style="s2">decided to bacon in the episode so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.530" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">just get started</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.220" end="00:02:17.560" style="s2">ooh I need you to enable screen sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:17.560" style="s2">sir</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.530" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">my sticky can you do it out let me find</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.830" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">it yes I can thank you much already</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:33.740" style="s2">welcome to Gaussian identity I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:35.600" style="s2">accused of using big words to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.740" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">myself sound intelligent which I always</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.600" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">respond that&#39;s preposterous so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">explain what this means last season we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.900" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">were exploring this meme without even</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:47.750" style="s2">knowing it which is rather interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:50.180" style="s2">we broke down the whole season in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.750" end="00:02:52.340" style="s2">various episodes covering various</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.180" end="00:02:55.250" style="s2">collections of these ideas so all season</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.340" end="00:02:57.260" style="s2">one was here basically everything that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.250" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">was being covered there which was</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.260" end="00:03:02.989" style="s2">Gnostic warfare we didn&#39;t get too much</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">into this side however so this season is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.989" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">going to be examining why this site even</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:11.000" style="s2">exists if you detect these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:12.590" style="s2">happening and what you can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.000" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">which I&#39;ll be calling it devouring</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.590" end="00:03:17.450" style="s2">humanism that&#39;s a play on words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:19.190" style="s2">whether humanism is devouring us or</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.450" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">perhaps we should devour it depending</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.190" end="00:03:23.959" style="s2">upon how you interpret it and as we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:26.660" style="s2">over this will explain why it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.959" end="00:03:28.730" style="s2">bad idea to do so so for season 4</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.660" end="00:03:31.250" style="s2">episode 1 we&#39;ll be focusing on gauzy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.730" end="00:03:36.860" style="s2">identity which covers these points in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.250" end="00:03:39.380" style="s2">the pink box thusly ok so what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.860" end="00:03:41.600" style="s2">identity isn&#39;t that the great question</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.380" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">everyone has a billion opinions on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.600" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">and for every person they have 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">definitions of identity and as always I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">challenge your definitions and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">guide it in a more lucrative fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:55.790" style="s2">let&#39;s start with how philosophy and math</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:58.160" style="s2">reviews identity it states very simply</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">that if anything that&#39;s indiscernible</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.160" end="00:04:04.519" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what the identity is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:07.130" style="s2">if x equals 6 and y equals 7 then x</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.519" end="00:04:10.519" style="s2">equals y and thus that&#39;s the identity x</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.130" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">equals y it&#39;s worth noting that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.519" end="00:04:14.180" style="s2">these two statements are what&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">them different despite the value that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.180" end="00:04:18.709" style="s2">they are but that again leads into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">realm of philosophy so what does</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.709" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">psychology and neurology have to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">they say that the brain is a meat-based</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:27.950" style="s2">Otto correlator of temporal events</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:31.630" style="s2">meaning if this is your timeline this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.950" end="00:04:33.700" style="s2">your time or X is your time and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.630" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">I forget what S stands for but the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.700" end="00:04:38.140" style="s2">is like Pat you have events that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:39.640" style="s2">going to happen they funnel into your</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.140" end="00:04:42.040" style="s2">brain and then they become past events</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.640" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">so the ability to correlate these events</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.040" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">is how you stitch your identity and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">psychology and neurology now whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.400" style="s2">that&#39;s completely true or not again</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:54.820" style="s2">philosophy and math and psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">neurology well it&#39;s not readily obvious</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.820" end="00:04:59.590" style="s2">how do I get x equals 6 and then some</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:01.240" style="s2">little dot being correlated to some</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.590" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">other dot that might happen it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.240" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">not an easy transfer it&#39;s not an easy</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:07.470" style="s2">way to comport the two domains so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:12.070" style="s2">automatically see right up front that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:13.690" style="s2">identity is really domain-specific and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.070" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">then we get the sociology where it says</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.690" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">you don&#39;t even exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:20.260" style="s2">you&#39;re just an intersection of groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">group dynamics so now I&#39;m here if this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.260" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">is Group A of circus clowns and giraffe</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">hunters and I don&#39;t know people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">like on the internet that I&#39;m here right</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:29.530" style="s2">so I don&#39;t even exist</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">I&#39;m just an intersection that&#39;s a court</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.530" end="00:05:36.130" style="s2">in sociology finance sees you as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:38.290" style="s2">vehicle for future activity and also a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.130" end="00:05:40.900" style="s2">modifiable vehicle for future activity</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.290" end="00:05:43.090" style="s2">you volunteer to promise future activity</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.900" end="00:05:45.190" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t deliver it they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.090" end="00:05:47.830" style="s2">ways to make you involuntarily deliver</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.190" end="00:05:50.170" style="s2">it so that&#39;s how Finance fuse identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.830" end="00:05:53.200" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re just a you&#39;re an occupant</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.170" end="00:05:57.010" style="s2">on a future bond basically on a future</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.200" end="00:05:58.630" style="s2">promise to deliver productivity is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.010" end="00:06:00.850" style="s2">may have heard the phrase let&#39;s pivot</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.630" end="00:06:03.040" style="s2">and go in a different direction in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.850" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">case you&#39;re a distribution of adjustable</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.040" end="00:06:07.390" style="s2">priority focuses maybe I&#39;m focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">checking my emails maybe I&#39;m focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.390" end="00:06:11.140" style="s2">writing code maybe I&#39;m focused on</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:13.450" style="s2">walking my dog and I shift between these</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.140" end="00:06:15.400" style="s2">distributions as time allows it so as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.450" end="00:06:17.350" style="s2">myself as project manager I have maximum</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.400" end="00:06:19.090" style="s2">flexibility with these individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.350" end="00:06:20.710" style="s2">identities so I can actually shift your</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.090" end="00:06:24.010" style="s2">focus and by doing so I change your</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.710" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">identity then there&#39;s alchemy alchemy is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.010" end="00:06:30.730" style="s2">a little-known thing there&#39;s a billion</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:33.190" style="s2">opinions on it but long story short the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.730" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">idea is that identity is never known it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.190" end="00:06:36.730" style="s2">is a black box it is a permanent black</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:39.100" style="s2">box you feed it context and you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.730" end="00:06:41.110" style="s2">action this is an old way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.100" end="00:06:43.450" style="s2">interpreting identity which is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.110" end="00:06:45.449" style="s2">considered anymore but we&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.450" end="00:06:47.650" style="s2">a way to bring this guy right on back</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.449" end="00:06:49.060" style="s2">and let&#39;s see to keep going what does</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.650" end="00:06:51.460" style="s2">physics say physics just threw up his</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.060" end="00:06:52.900" style="s2">hands around 1930 with the Pauli</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.460" end="00:06:55.270" style="s2">exclusion principle where it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.900" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">figure out anything really I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.270" end="00:06:58.840" style="s2">tell you one photon from another it</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:01.330" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure out fermions from</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.840" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">anything it&#39;s all meso you couldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.330" end="00:07:05.740" style="s2">rely on physics to figure out well this</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:07.600" style="s2">atom is occupying this unique spot in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.740" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">time and then this atoms occupy well it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.600" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">turns out they they sometimes overlap</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:14.050" style="s2">and occupy the same space because their</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:15.940" style="s2">distribution of probability of existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:18.280" style="s2">so it gets real messy can&#39;t even rely on</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.940" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">physics for identity then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.280" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">biology where every time your cells go</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">through mitosis they keep asserting the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.470" style="s2">same DNA over every generation over and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">over and over again perhaps that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.470" end="00:07:29.530" style="s2">identity and then there&#39;s error</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:32.500" style="s2">correcting in the DNA duplication</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.530" end="00:07:33.760" style="s2">process to keep that continuity going so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.500" end="00:07:36.789" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong biological definition</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.760" end="00:07:39.430" style="s2">of identity right there and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.789" end="00:07:41.650" style="s2">geopolitics where where you are born you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.430" end="00:07:43.000" style="s2">are bound to the rival as power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.650" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">of whatever group you&#39;re born into</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.000" end="00:07:48.010" style="s2">because on this spheroid we call Earth</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.490" end="00:07:49.270" style="s2">not all topologies are equal they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.010" end="00:07:51.310" style="s2">all equally valuable they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.270" end="00:07:53.410" style="s2">equal resources on them and no matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.310" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">how we configure ourselves according to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.410" end="00:07:56.970" style="s2">all the previous mentioned domains we</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">might not get equality of outcome either</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.970" end="00:08:03.400" style="s2">so all of these things are heuristics of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:06.669" style="s2">identity so the idea of saying that this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.400" end="00:08:08.229" style="s2">is identity and and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.669" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">race thing or it&#39;s a gender thing or</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.229" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">it&#39;s it man it&#39;s all over the place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a there was a whole grab bag of of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">concepts you can use to define identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:25.060" style="s2">and as we assemble those heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:27.190" style="s2">together that&#39;s what politics is let me</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.060" end="00:08:29.289" style="s2">walk you through that firecracker of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.190" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">statement right so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.289" end="00:08:35.349" style="s2">race-based scientific nationalism which</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:38.680" style="s2">we all know is a certain continental</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.349" end="00:08:40.409" style="s2">country in 1940 tried this out where</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">they decided to put the heuristic of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.409" end="00:08:46.870" style="s2">genetics and geo d&#39;Estaing geopolitics</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.240" end="00:08:50.020" style="s2">at the first priority of their political</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.870" end="00:08:51.820" style="s2">system meaning when it came to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.020" end="00:08:55.780" style="s2">resources that a political system could</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.820" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">channel or control or modify when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.780" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">came to flowing it through its political</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:02.500" style="s2">web the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:04.570" style="s2">two points got first dibs so these guys</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.500" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">got first access to it and as you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.570" end="00:09:08.740" style="s2">further down the chain you get least and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:10.330" style="s2">least access so all these guys get all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.740" end="00:09:11.650" style="s2">the nice stuff and then you know crumbs</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.330" end="00:09:14.140" style="s2">everyone else and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.650" end="00:09:16.770" style="s2">prioritization of identity heuristics in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.140" end="00:09:18.730" style="s2">politics and as you change these around</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.770" end="00:09:21.670" style="s2">you get totally different political</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.730" end="00:09:23.200" style="s2">systems so in the case of race-based</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:25.960" style="s2">scientific nationalism I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.200" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">genetics and Geo destiny at the front</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.960" end="00:09:29.470" style="s2">psychology comes next I&#39;m gonna look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:31.270" style="s2">physics as something to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.470" end="00:09:33.310" style="s2">regarding identity then math and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.270" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">eventually Finance and Finance usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.310" end="00:09:37.240" style="s2">finances like this fulcrum this bowtie</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">where everything on this side is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.240" end="00:09:42.120" style="s2">driver and everything on this side is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.100" end="00:09:44.410" style="s2">management then you get groups and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.120" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">individual is just like way to hell down</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.410" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">Honda you don&#39;t get any resources buddy</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">sorry science is way more important than</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:52.930" style="s2">you are that&#39;s just life and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.850" style="s2">turn around psychometric liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.930" end="00:09:56.770" style="s2">capitalism where we put psychology at</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.850" end="00:09:58.570" style="s2">the top the research of psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.770" end="00:09:59.170" style="s2">the analyst and the analysis of human</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.570" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.170" end="00:10:03.670" style="s2">mathematics is gonna try best at these</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">two factors alone you get psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.670" end="00:10:08.230" style="s2">economics which then you bind to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:10.870" style="s2">horse of financial management and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.230" end="00:10:13.030" style="s2">you get everything else and and in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.870" end="00:10:15.100" style="s2">case you know physics is just not even</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.030" end="00:10:17.110" style="s2">remotely important in any type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.100" end="00:10:19.690" style="s2">liberal capitalism and then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.110" end="00:10:21.520" style="s2">erasing geopolitics of course those are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.690" end="00:10:23.620" style="s2">going to be at the end the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.520" end="00:10:25.990" style="s2">liberal capitalism is to maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.620" end="00:10:28.930" style="s2">psychology of each individual&#39;s so these</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.990" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">things should be smooth out and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.930" end="00:10:33.580" style="s2">matter because we can always modify the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:35.230" style="s2">brain and then you have communal blank</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.580" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">slate capitalism which people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.230" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2">call communism which is adorable but a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:41.709" style="s2">state you know it&#39;s state capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">with the assumptions of communal blank</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.709" end="00:10:46.390" style="s2">slates so the idea of sociology being</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:48.580" style="s2">the core driver of financial management</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.390" end="00:10:51.130" style="s2">meaning how do i configure these</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.580" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">intersections of groups to then bind</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.130" end="00:10:55.779" style="s2">their productivity to what I need or I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">bind their promises of the future to my</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.779" end="00:10:59.470" style="s2">ability to manage everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:02.380" style="s2">psychology comes downstream of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.470" end="00:11:04.029" style="s2">which is an odd priority individuals</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.380" end="00:11:06.450" style="s2">come a little bit higher than most other</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.029" end="00:11:08.250" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.450" end="00:11:10.620" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting pen that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.250" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">alchemy tends to over weigh geopolitics</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:13.710" style="s2">after all these guys want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:14.280" style="s2">dissolve borders in that type of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.710" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.280" end="00:11:17.190" style="s2">but these are just examples I might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">giving them the wrong names and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.190" end="00:11:23.300" style="s2">free to go full autism and stickler on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:25.800" style="s2">that but I&#39;m just demonstrating a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.300" end="00:11:27.750" style="s2">politics do priorities on identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.800" end="00:11:30.120" style="s2">heuristics not individual identities</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.750" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what we and democracy in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.120" end="00:11:33.570" style="s2">America tend to get confused about we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:35.700" style="s2">tend to think that certain identities</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.570" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">get priority but in reality it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.700" end="00:11:39.210" style="s2">heuristic of identities that gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:42.030" style="s2">priority how do we determine what</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.210" end="00:11:45.930" style="s2">identities exist that&#39;s what&#39;s given</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.030" end="00:11:48.780" style="s2">primacy and by the way all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.930" end="00:11:50.610" style="s2">permutations well look at that they just</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.780" end="00:11:53.730" style="s2">happen to be the blue church political</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.610" end="00:11:55.530" style="s2">distribution trend so when we say blue</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.730" end="00:11:58.650" style="s2">church we&#39;re talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.530" end="00:12:00.600" style="s2">configurations of priority and how</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.820" end="00:12:14.790" style="s2">makes it a distribution trend and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.320" end="00:12:17.160" style="s2">is what a blue church is is a</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.160" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">take priority so let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.390" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2">mutation because I brought it up so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:26.310" style="s2">does the mutation of a political system</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">look like well it goes something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.310" end="00:12:30.030" style="s2">this you turn around to the two</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.870" end="00:13:10.920" style="s2">so what do we do well we just found a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.090" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">way to create psychometric liberal</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.920" end="00:13:14.100" style="s2">capitalism from race-based scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">nationalism and all we had to do was</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.100" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">change our identity heuristics we need</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:19.779" style="s2">to put psychology and Finance at the top</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.589" end="00:13:26.709" style="s2">them we didn&#39;t like the idea of genetic</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:51.220" style="s2">that gets us all the goodies we did it</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">the great struggles over look at us and</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.529" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">have a revolution or did we just have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.449" end="00:14:08.529" style="s2">mutation everybody wants a revolution</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.769" end="00:14:33.430" style="s2">nobody gets any crumbs now why is it a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.899" end="00:14:35.439" style="s2">blue church is it a blue church because</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.430" end="00:14:37.660" style="s2">of the individual configurations</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.439" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">no that&#39;s not it is it a blue church</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.660" end="00:14:41.949" style="s2">because the priorities that are at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:43.509" style="s2">top that&#39;s not it either the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.949" end="00:14:45.759" style="s2">those things in the previous slide or</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.509" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">the blue church is because of what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.759" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">put last</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.240" end="00:14:56.590" style="s2">these guys hate absolutely loathe</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.430" end="00:14:58.960" style="s2">anything that is theocracy that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.590" end="00:15:01.240" style="s2">religious that is alchemical that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.960" end="00:15:03.190" style="s2">mystical these concepts of human</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.240" end="00:15:05.320" style="s2">psychology are not allowed to exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.190" end="00:15:06.390" style="s2">unchecked in a blue church scenario</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.320" end="00:15:08.050" style="s2">because they&#39;re dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.390" end="00:15:09.700" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.050" end="00:15:11.500" style="s2">these meticulous systems of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.700" end="00:15:13.450" style="s2">psychological finance with these</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.500" end="00:15:16.360" style="s2">meticulous systems of race driven</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.450" end="00:15:18.100" style="s2">nationalism if you if you screw with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.360" end="00:15:20.710" style="s2">configuration of any one of those tiny</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.100" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">axioms that power these systems and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.710" end="00:15:24.640" style="s2">can do that well now you have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:27.490" style="s2">so these guys are the biggest threat</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.640" end="00:15:28.900" style="s2">because they can actually screw up your</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:30.430" style="s2">entire distribution flow in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.900" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">political system so that&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.430" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">driven to the redheaded stepchild okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:38.050" style="s2">so how do you do this we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">now we&#39;re looking at the gradient we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.050" end="00:15:42.340" style="s2">not actually interested in the we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:43.510" style="s2">looking at the permutation of identity</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.340" end="00:15:45.610" style="s2">heuristics now we&#39;re just looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.510" end="00:15:47.200" style="s2">overall gradient so let&#39;s just step back</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.610" end="00:15:48.850" style="s2">and look at the gradient of resource</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.200" end="00:15:51.550" style="s2">distribution independent of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.850" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">political system may exist it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.550" end="00:15:55.570" style="s2">left to right all the crumbs go here is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:58.540" style="s2">your military industrial complex and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.570" end="00:16:01.810" style="s2">here&#39;s funding your school right so keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.540" end="00:16:04.440" style="s2">that in mind so now let&#39;s look at why</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.810" end="00:16:08.020" style="s2">the blue church political gradient</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.440" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">persists with the reinforcement factors</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.020" end="00:16:11.470" style="s2">it has from that that funny little meme</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:14.200" style="s2">that was at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.470" end="00:16:16.870" style="s2">presentation we have runaway self</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.200" end="00:16:19.630" style="s2">domestication as the top the idea that a</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.630" end="00:16:23.950" style="s2">and meme which is always wanting in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.820" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">case once a person becomes caught in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.950" end="00:16:27.100" style="s2">runaway self domestication phase they</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:29.800" style="s2">have a high chance of staying here on</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.100" end="00:16:31.060" style="s2">their own they don&#39;t wander off and try</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.800" end="00:16:32.710" style="s2">to experiment with other type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.060" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">identity heuristics once they&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.710" end="00:16:36.430" style="s2">they&#39;re here it&#39;s pretty hard to break</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:39.190" style="s2">it you actually have to do systemic</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.430" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">level attacks to break this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.190" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">easy</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:23.860" style="s2">right then the internet happened that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.800" end="00:26:26.380" style="s2">changed things because now you could</p>

<p begin="00:26:53.560" end="00:26:58.060" style="s2">begin with is because it was too</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.330" end="00:27:00.850" style="s2">expensive to send any type of proof of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.060" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">identity in the early internet wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.150" end="00:27:13.900" style="s2">or all the metadata crap that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.710" end="00:27:15.640" style="s2">now you just had text period and if all</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.900" end="00:27:17.770" style="s2">you had all you have with each other is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.640" end="00:27:19.930" style="s2">text man you could lie all day long</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.770" end="00:27:21.250" style="s2">there is no proof of identity you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.930" end="00:27:24.020" style="s2">even a force here and it&#39;s way too</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:25.640" style="s2">expensive so that&#39;s how this</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.020" end="00:27:27.500" style="s2">game started and when you deal with like</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.640" end="00:27:29.030" style="s2">some of the really old people on 4chan</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.500" end="00:27:30.920" style="s2">they remember these days these are the</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.030" end="00:27:59.960" style="s2">internet was a way to say that I</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.769" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">representation of all of these things so</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:56.289" style="s2">there&#39;s automatically a mistranslation</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">and let&#39;s look what that mistranslation</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.289" end="00:30:03.460" style="s2">looks like so when you get started way</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:08.470" style="s2">back and I don&#39;t know 1980 imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.460" end="00:30:11.230" style="s2">each pixel is like I mean obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.470" end="00:30:13.539" style="s2">pixelated image but try and pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.230" end="00:30:15.610" style="s2">as you&#39;re collecting gee as your GPS</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.539" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">technology is growing as your sound</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.610" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">print technologies growing as your image</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:21.940" style="s2">technology is growing it starts out</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:22.659" style="s2">really weak it doesn&#39;t have high</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.940" end="00:30:25.090" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.659" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">maybe the GPS is only sending one paying</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.090" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">a minute maybe the maybe the voice</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:32.019" style="s2">prints only capturing one every second</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:33.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really low resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.019" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make sense between them</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.880" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">all but as Moore&#39;s Law goes on your</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">Gaussian identity which is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:43.389" style="s2">collection of all of these things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:45.940" style="s2">make you up in the digital space the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.389" end="00:30:48.850" style="s2">distribution of these data points it</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.940" end="00:30:51.220" style="s2">increases in resolution over time so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.850" end="00:30:53.019" style="s2">we can understand better how to market</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.220" end="00:30:55.029" style="s2">to you and better to understand your</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.019" end="00:30:56.740" style="s2">psychological dispositions and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.029" end="00:30:59.110" style="s2">social network you&#39;re gonna go to next</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.740" end="00:31:01.299" style="s2">and it gets even better over time and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.110" end="00:31:04.419" style="s2">gets really good over time so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.299" end="00:31:06.970" style="s2">increasing the fidelity of our identity</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.419" end="00:31:10.059" style="s2">selection mechanisms as as Moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.970" end="00:31:12.029" style="s2">goes up it&#39;s pretty obvious at least so</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.059" end="00:31:14.200" style="s2">what happens when we get good enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.029" end="00:31:16.269" style="s2">what happens when we get to the spot</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:18.220" style="s2">where it yeah maybe doesn&#39;t you know we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.269" end="00:31:20.139" style="s2">don&#39;t have all the data on this person</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.220" end="00:31:21.940" style="s2">we have enough to get what he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.139" end="00:31:25.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s where we get our Gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.940" end="00:31:27.070" style="s2">distribution not all data is infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.480" end="00:31:29.620" style="s2">valuable and I feel real bad for</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.070" end="00:31:31.720" style="s2">investors come 2025 where they say data</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.620" end="00:31:34.029" style="s2">is the new oil that&#39;s not true there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.720" end="00:31:36.610" style="s2">Gaussian distribution meaning the</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.700" end="00:31:49.959" style="s2">resolution and an extremely good</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.709" end="00:31:51.669" style="s2">resolution but that&#39;s not what&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.109" end="00:32:07.389" style="s2">these two spaces no is is the data I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.529" end="00:32:08.619" style="s2">have on this person it&#39;s not a blob or</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.389" end="00:32:09.879" style="s2">is that a person I don&#39;t know what that</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.879" end="00:32:14.469" style="s2">answer that question that&#39;s gonna drive</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.889" end="00:32:16.209" style="s2">me to answer that question and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.469" end="00:32:18.279" style="s2">gonna start collecting more data like oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.209" end="00:32:20.169" style="s2">how how long is my fingernail on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.279" end="00:32:22.359" style="s2">Tuesday you gonna turn that into</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.169" end="00:32:24.309" style="s2">marketing data right well so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.359" end="00:32:25.899" style="s2">need to increase more information you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.309" end="00:32:27.249" style="s2">don&#39;t need to gather more stuff there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.899" end="00:32:29.820" style="s2">a sweet spot right here</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.249" end="00:32:32.589" style="s2">and once you identify that sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.820" end="00:32:34.959" style="s2">tinkering with these pressures will</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.950" end="00:33:10.690" style="s2">today how do we beat how do we work with</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.229" end="00:33:12.759" style="s2">the inability to deploy Turing test so</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.690" end="00:33:14.909" style="s2">instead of driving people back they</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.759" end="00:33:17.950" style="s2">drive him forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.909" end="00:33:19.679" style="s2">well we mimic the blue church with bots</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.950" end="00:33:23.190" style="s2">and we use natural language processing</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.190" end="00:33:27.879" style="s2">because they can&#39;t deploy Turing test to</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.389" end="00:33:30.999" style="s2">stop them so now the people who are here</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.879" end="00:33:32.289" style="s2">I can push him up a line I can get them</p>

<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:44.409" style="s2">when if you get an online argument</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:23.220" style="s2">and so many people that if you do not</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.220" end="00:42:27.930" style="s2">playing the win so what you do is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.940" end="00:42:29.880" style="s2">typical statement is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.930" end="00:42:31.500" style="s2">they&#39;re not alive or they&#39;re not human</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.880" end="00:42:33.690" style="s2">or all these things that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.500" end="00:42:35.570" style="s2">the point is I can make you see them</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.790" end="00:42:56.450" style="s2">if I decide to disproportionately apply</p>

<p begin="00:42:56.450" end="00:43:01.550" style="s2">racist or what is it so what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.510" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">now is I&#39;m using the woman the morality</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.130" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">in this for whatever reason this mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.940" end="00:43:11.900" style="s2">that they have swore this hill they</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:14.150" style="s2">would die on over and over again so this</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.900" end="00:43:17.450" style="s2">is kind of a blend of the predetonation</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.150" end="00:43:18.710" style="s2">strategy but again you you attack here</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.450" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">not because you have an opinion on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.710" end="00:43:22.730" style="s2">subject you attack here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.260" style="s2">they have just sunk so many goddamn</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.730" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">hours and they&#39;re making people think</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.260" end="00:43:27.320" style="s2">that this is the hill to die on that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:29.630" style="s2">have to activate it and the gold</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.320" end="00:43:31.940" style="s2">activated is to drive them to the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.630" end="00:43:33.380" style="s2">because they either either dig in and</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.940" end="00:43:34.820" style="s2">they keep going this way and they get</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.380" end="00:43:37.310" style="s2">rewarded for digging and then they will</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.820" end="00:43:39.230" style="s2">or they start to see that hey now wait a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.310" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">second maybe disproportionately aborting</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.230" end="00:43:42.320" style="s2">aborting females might be a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:44.300" style="s2">and which this whole system will then</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.320" end="00:43:49.100" style="s2">whack them and you know into our tunnel</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:50.300" style="s2">into our tunnel they go universalism the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.100" end="00:43:52.600" style="s2">beautiful idea that we&#39;re all the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.300" end="00:43:55.460" style="s2">and we should all be treated equally</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.600" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">yeah these are beautiful words most</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.460" end="00:43:59.750" style="s2">beautiful words ever written no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.160" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">but there&#39;s a reason tribalism exists in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.750" end="00:44:04.450" style="s2">our in our psychology and as a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:07.460" style="s2">armor and the idea that I go to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.450" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">identity tribe or an identity tribe but</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.460" end="00:44:11.870" style="s2">I go to this tribal state with people</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:15.140" style="s2">who are similar to myself and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.870" end="00:44:17.450" style="s2">just to reassert confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.140" end="00:44:19.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a blue church concept we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.450" end="00:44:20.690" style="s2">to these tribes so that we can defend</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.130" end="00:44:23.120" style="s2">ourselves from the onslaught of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.690" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">epistemic wildness that&#39;s coming our way</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.120" end="00:44:26.600" style="s2">we can&#39;t make sense of it alone and if</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:29.240" style="s2">we are alone you&#39;re drifting in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.600" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">ocean of chaos that&#39;s gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.240" end="00:44:34.040" style="s2">toss because toss back back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:35.480" style="s2">between this gradient and nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.040" end="00:44:36.950" style="s2">that because they know one person can</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.480" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">make sense of any of this stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.950" end="00:44:41.390" style="s2">just way too much data points so you go</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:45.110" style="s2">to tribes to to give you a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.390" end="00:44:48.490" style="s2">armor a filter a way of processing all</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.110" end="00:44:52.060" style="s2">of this noise that&#39;s going on so you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.490" end="00:44:53.800" style="s2">what you do is you provide tribes that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.060" end="00:44:56.980" style="s2">correspond to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.800" end="00:44:58.390" style="s2">universalism so for example universalism</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.980" end="00:44:59.770" style="s2">this wonderful idea that we can all push</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.390" end="00:45:01.570" style="s2">each other in one direction or another</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.770" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">we can all we were all the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.570" end="00:45:05.950" style="s2">I mean tribes a cycle or what if I make</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:09.810" style="s2">a tribe that whatever make a tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.950" end="00:45:12.970" style="s2">universalism what if I make a tribe of</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.810" end="00:45:14.830" style="s2">the people who like universalism what if</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.970" end="00:45:16.990" style="s2">I just fragment this down over and over</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.830" end="00:45:19.180" style="s2">again and it looks like universalism all</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.990" end="00:45:20.470" style="s2">the same but in reality I&#39;m normalizing</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.180" end="00:45:21.970" style="s2">their entry in the tribes and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.470" end="00:45:24.280" style="s2">normalizing their ability to go into</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.970" end="00:45:26.080" style="s2">these places so now once they do it they</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.280" end="00:45:28.090" style="s2">have psycho armor and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.080" end="00:45:29.530" style="s2">the universalism doesn&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.090" end="00:45:32.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re locally bound to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.530" end="00:45:33.940" style="s2">people in that tribe over time so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.440" end="00:45:35.530" style="s2">instead of leaving the door open for as</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.940" end="00:45:37.570" style="s2">many human beings as possible like we</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.530" end="00:45:39.580" style="s2">were just some statistical graph they</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.570" end="00:45:41.620" style="s2">start making informing actual bonds with</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.580" end="00:45:43.660" style="s2">people and upon doing so they will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.620" end="00:45:48.220" style="s2">seen as enemies of the regime and to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.660" end="00:45:52.330" style="s2">right they go self victimization again</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.220" end="00:45:53.770" style="s2">the the idea that I am a martyr I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.589" end="00:47:40.250" style="s2">people say that what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.089" end="00:47:42.829" style="s2">rationalize when the regime makes a wild</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.250" end="00:47:44.450" style="s2">swing so like when the regime says we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.829" end="00:47:46.460" style="s2">gonna save you know cats</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.450" end="00:47:48.799" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like yes I&#39;m a cat person and</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.569" end="00:47:54.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s a rationalization that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.309" end="00:48:01.460" style="s2">because of course you do look at all the</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.690" end="00:48:22.099" style="s2">that population up see just drop memes</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.799" end="00:49:04.940" style="s2">the system is able to use that abuse as</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.690" end="00:49:07.099" style="s2">rationalization to restore itself so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.940" end="00:49:09.710" style="s2">can&#39;t deploy levels of violence on them</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.099" end="00:49:12.980" style="s2">but we do have the internet we have our</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.490" end="00:49:33.770" style="s2">they let that thing like 20,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.590" end="00:49:35.750" style="s2">ago their way the hell off it so we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.770" end="00:49:37.369" style="s2">use this pipeline to artificially</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.750" end="00:49:39.710" style="s2">fulfill the thing that they&#39;ve never had</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.369" end="00:49:41.390" style="s2">so instead of coming at these guys with</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.710" end="00:49:43.609" style="s2">warlike intent you actually come to them</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.390" end="00:49:44.780" style="s2">with flowers and roses and you say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.609" end="00:49:46.190" style="s2">gonna make you part of this group we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.190" end="00:49:49.070" style="s2">gonna treat you like a human being like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.690" end="00:49:50.599" style="s2">legitimately instead of you being</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.070" end="00:49:52.190" style="s2">surrounded by your fellow rejects all</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.599" end="00:49:54.170" style="s2">the time we&#39;re gonna reach out to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.190" end="00:49:56.660" style="s2">and grab you and say hey man you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.170" end="00:49:58.490" style="s2">human just like us and that is not what</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.660" end="00:50:00.349" style="s2">this system is prepared for they do not</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.490" end="00:50:03.050" style="s2">like that because this is the last step</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.349" end="00:50:05.869" style="s2">this is the basis of their entire regime</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.050" end="00:50:07.099" style="s2">moral structure is the idea that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.869" end="00:50:08.900" style="s2">surrounded themselves with these</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.099" end="00:50:11.180" style="s2">historically displaced people and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.900" end="00:50:13.430" style="s2">use them as a human shield the only way</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.180" end="00:50:16.310" style="s2">to beat them is to actually display</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.430" end="00:50:18.200" style="s2">decent humanism towards them over and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.310" end="00:50:20.660" style="s2">over again even if it costs you your</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.200" end="00:50:23.180" style="s2">life even if it costs you everything you</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.660" end="00:50:25.430" style="s2">have you have to include them and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.180" end="00:50:26.869" style="s2">have to take care of them because this</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.430" end="00:50:28.450" style="s2">is not what that system is prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.869" end="00:50:30.710" style="s2">handle it&#39;s the last thing they&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.450" end="00:50:32.210" style="s2">and then run away domestication you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.710" end="00:50:33.920" style="s2">can&#39;t even touch run away domestication</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.210" end="00:50:35.230" style="s2">until you&#39;ve addressed all of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.920" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">other points there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.230" end="00:50:40.670" style="s2">so once you&#39;ve been able to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:42.339" style="s2">now you can change how celebrities are</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.670" end="00:50:44.540" style="s2">perceived that&#39;s one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.339" end="00:50:47.000" style="s2">reinforces of runaway self domestication</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.540" end="00:50:48.710" style="s2">well I&#39;m doing this thing I&#39;m self</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.000" end="00:50:50.990" style="s2">domesticated myself and I always check</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.710" end="00:50:53.089" style="s2">and I see oh there&#39;s a popular person oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.990" end="00:50:55.460" style="s2">okay oh whatever the popular persons</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.089" end="00:50:58.099" style="s2">doing okay I&#39;ll incorporate it of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.460" end="00:51:01.640" style="s2">regime controls celebrity but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.099" end="00:51:03.560" style="s2">make everybody a celebrity if instead of</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.640" end="00:51:05.869" style="s2">celebrities being this small collection</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.560" end="00:51:09.650" style="s2">of pre-sorted individuals if every</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.869" end="00:51:11.930" style="s2">single human being was a celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.650" end="00:51:13.579" style="s2">well that changes things that changes</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.930" end="00:51:15.559" style="s2">everything now how do you do that well</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.579" end="00:51:18.769" style="s2">where are you living through it now the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.559" end="00:51:20.299" style="s2">idea of like twitch people or or people</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.769" end="00:51:22.220" style="s2">doing live-streaming or micro</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.299" end="00:51:23.630" style="s2">celebrities or stuff like that you use</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.220" end="00:51:25.819" style="s2">that technique and you make it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.630" end="00:51:26.869" style="s2">accessible you take this this drive to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.819" end="00:51:28.519" style="s2">be a celebrity and you make it</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.869" end="00:51:30.470" style="s2">everywhere you make it as open as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.519" end="00:51:32.150" style="s2">can for everybody and so these people</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.470" end="00:51:34.039" style="s2">who run away self domesticate they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.150" end="00:51:35.509" style="s2">still engage in the self domestication</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.039" end="00:51:37.069" style="s2">mechanism you&#39;re never going to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.509" end="00:51:39.019" style="s2">that it&#39;s just core to their being</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.069" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">but they&#39;re gonna pick the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.019" end="00:51:43.819" style="s2">celebrity so instead of like a list of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">100 now they have like million and which</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.819" end="00:51:46.730" style="s2">one do they pick well it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.920" end="00:51:47.869" style="s2">which one they pick</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.730" end="00:51:49.849" style="s2">they&#39;re picking there&#39;s so many options</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.869" end="00:51:51.259" style="s2">that they can&#39;t pick the same one so</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.849" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">that one celebrity that held all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.259" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">power it&#39;s gone diffused utterly gone</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:51:59.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.090" end="00:52:06.750" style="s2">that was intense so let&#39;s see where this</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.600" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">may go when we apply this regime hacking</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.750" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">that I&#39;m proposing we&#39;re gonna look at</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:13.490" style="s2">our psychometric liberal capitalism all</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:15.360" style="s2">the identity heuristics that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.490" end="00:52:18.900" style="s2">accessible to the resources that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.360" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">available in the order of thus and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.900" end="00:52:25.110" style="s2">remember around here the pipeline ships</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:27.210" style="s2">where are driving people this way is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.110" end="00:52:28.920" style="s2">goal of the regime and once you get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.210" end="00:52:34.020" style="s2">this point you drive them this way until</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.920" end="00:52:35.880" style="s2">they become full Alex Jones so we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.020" end="00:52:39.360" style="s2">walk through a system of pushing people</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.880" end="00:52:41.010" style="s2">here this way and then pushing people</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.360" end="00:52:43.400" style="s2">here this way so that when they get here</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.010" end="00:52:45.410" style="s2">they can push back this way</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.400" end="00:52:47.690" style="s2">so what does that mean just because you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.410" end="00:52:49.970" style="s2">push the people doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.690" end="00:52:51.559" style="s2">walking through these identity</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.970" end="00:52:53.240" style="s2">heuristics as they get pushed through</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.559" end="00:52:54.859" style="s2">the pipeline that&#39;s not what happens as</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.240" end="00:52:57.260" style="s2">they get pushed through the pipeline</p>

<p begin="00:55:04.070" end="00:55:07.880" style="s2">one which you said it was sort of tricky</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.600" end="00:55:09.410" style="s2">I was actually thinking of writing an</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.880" end="00:55:10.490" style="s2">article called the last man syndrome to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.410" end="00:55:12.830" style="s2">kind of like unpack the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.490" end="00:55:14.750" style="s2">characteristics of that and a guy like</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.830" end="00:55:16.910" style="s2">Peterson you know he kind of addresses</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.750" end="00:55:19.790" style="s2">the last man directly with like clean</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.910" end="00:55:22.280" style="s2">your room and like that um so what</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.790" end="00:55:24.650" style="s2">do you think of like his approach to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.280" end="00:55:31.030" style="s2">addressing that and how effective was</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.650" end="00:55:34.250" style="s2">that his approach is a kick to the face</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.030" end="00:55:36.890" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t feel like it but it is but</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.250" end="00:55:39.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a necessary kick because what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.890" end="00:55:42.320" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s trying to regain the idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.710" end="00:55:44.120" style="s2">that accountability exists and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.320" end="00:55:45.980" style="s2">do that in universalism and you have</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.980" end="00:55:49.790" style="s2">between you and me so who the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.320" end="00:55:51.350" style="s2">accountable if you&#39;re just as</p>

<p begin="00:55:54.080" end="00:55:58.190" style="s2">accountability so if you&#39;re the last man</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.060" end="00:56:01.160" style="s2">and you&#39;re starting to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.190" end="00:56:02.810" style="s2">perhaps some of the problems you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.160" end="00:56:04.430" style="s2">facing may be coming from a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.810" end="00:56:05.870" style="s2">accountability but you might not have</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.069" end="01:01:20.359" style="s2">there are a heavy dependence upon that</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.359" end="01:01:25.460" style="s2">for encryption today the NSA what if the</p>

<p begin="01:01:25.460" end="01:01:29.690" style="s2"> the internet would be over right so</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.829" end="01:01:31.220" style="s2">you still even now you have mathematics</p>

<p begin="01:01:31.220" end="01:01:35.089" style="s2">and I suspect when it comes to alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.980" end="01:01:37.369" style="s2">that the same type of chain of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.089" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">dependency also forms naturally because</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.369" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">alchemy is it is this</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:46.020" style="s2">it is a heuristic on how to organize</p>

<p begin="01:01:46.020" end="01:01:49.990" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the easiest way to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.130" end="01:01:52.420" style="s2">describe it so if you can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.990" end="01:01:54.460" style="s2">how to build a spaceship how do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.420" end="01:01:56.020" style="s2">organize people to build a spaceship for</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.460" end="01:01:58.180" style="s2">you even though you don&#39;t know how to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.020" end="01:02:00.460" style="s2">it and that&#39;s what alchemy gives you</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.180" end="01:02:01.869" style="s2">some understanding of how to do and once</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.460" end="01:02:08.440" style="s2">you got a secret on that you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.869" end="01:02:09.670" style="s2">gonna keep it so thank you very much all</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.440" end="01:02:10.869" style="s2">right so I&#39;m gonna read this question on</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.670" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">someone&#39;s behalf</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.869" end="01:02:15.130" style="s2">how much mobility Pat thinks there is in</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:17.290" style="s2">this spectrum as individuals how much</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.130" end="01:02:20.470" style="s2">mobility is being experienced are these</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.290" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">states exclusive of each other mobility</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.470" end="01:02:24.310" style="s2">as in the ability to move through you</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.390" end="01:02:26.560" style="s2">won&#39;t you won&#39;t experience mobility in</p>

<p begin="01:02:26.560" end="01:02:31.390" style="s2">experience is the constant struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.540" end="01:02:33.550" style="s2">not be pushed to the right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.390" end="01:02:35.290" style="s2">you&#39;ll experience so that that will</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.550" end="01:02:36.820" style="s2">manifest as social pressure that will</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.290" end="01:02:38.890" style="s2">manifest as keeping up with the Joneses</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.820" end="01:02:40.420" style="s2">like manifest is I&#39;m not making enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.890" end="01:02:42.339" style="s2">money I&#39;m not living up to my parents</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.420" end="01:02:43.660" style="s2">ambition I&#39;m not worshiping my ancestors</p>

<p begin="01:02:45.400" end="01:02:49.690" style="s2">right minority at the right time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.589" end="01:02:51.910" style="s2">not mobilely moving you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.690" end="01:02:53.560" style="s2">freedom to move through a regime it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.910" end="01:02:55.510" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s not the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.560" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">regime the regime is to identify where</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.510" end="01:03:00.460" style="s2">you can be put in the cost of control</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:03.220" style="s2">paradigm while you&#39;re still extracting</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.460" end="01:03:05.170" style="s2">useful goods and so you&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.220" end="01:03:08.650" style="s2">selecting for what type of control it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.170" end="01:03:10.510" style="s2">you want to be under and the regime&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.650" end="01:03:12.250" style="s2">job is to just create as many panel</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.510" end="01:03:14.560" style="s2">channels and as possible that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.250" end="01:03:16.300" style="s2">cost-efficient for their maintenance so</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.560" end="01:03:17.859" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not mobility in the sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.300" end="01:03:19.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s like saying that I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.859" end="01:03:21.099" style="s2">prison do I have mobility to jump</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.359" end="01:03:22.690" style="s2">between cells I mean yeah but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.099" end="01:03:25.089" style="s2">still in the prison I mean what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.690" end="01:03:26.890" style="s2">gonna do for you you get closer to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.089" end="01:03:28.599" style="s2">mess hall I guess you can have better</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.890" end="01:03:30.550" style="s2">trade with the you know with the corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.599" end="01:03:31.660" style="s2">guard there but but that&#39;s about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.550" end="01:03:33.339" style="s2">that&#39;s what I get to look forward to</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.660" end="01:03:35.770" style="s2">your your chances of being thrown in an</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.339" end="01:03:37.030" style="s2">isolation are much higher if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.770" end="01:03:38.710" style="s2">step out of line and that&#39;s true in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.030" end="01:03:40.950" style="s2">regime as well so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.710" end="01:03:43.720" style="s2">experiencing mobility as much as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.950" end="01:03:45.070" style="s2">you&#39;re fighting entropy you&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.720" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">social order entropy to hold your</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.070" end="01:03:51.550" style="s2">position and whatever cost beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:55.170" style="s2">slot of prison that you just happen to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.550" end="01:03:57.099" style="s2">be okay enough with so</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.170" end="01:03:58.930" style="s2">all right so here&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.099" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">when I read once someone emerges from</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.930" end="01:04:03.759" style="s2">last man through nostalgia how do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:05.079" style="s2">insert a new identity heuristic is this</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.759" end="01:04:07.689" style="s2">what religion captures in the blue</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.079" end="01:04:10.269" style="s2">church takes the alchemy box and refocus</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.689" end="01:04:12.279" style="s2">it towards self domestication you might</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.269" end="01:04:14.529" style="s2">have noticed in this whole thing I never</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.279" end="01:04:17.109" style="s2">explained how to get someone from one</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.529" end="01:04:18.969" style="s2">identity heuristic to another and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.109" end="01:04:22.630" style="s2">reason I didn&#39;t do that is because it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.969" end="01:04:24.219" style="s2">way too expensive it is so cost</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.630" end="01:04:26.049" style="s2">intense to get a person this shift from</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.219" end="01:04:28.390" style="s2">one heuristic to another how do you take</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.049" end="01:04:30.369" style="s2">a scientist and say guess what is to you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.390" end="01:04:33.519" style="s2">a political time when that scientist has</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.369" end="01:04:35.619" style="s2">spent their entire lives embracing all</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.519" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">of the techniques and have been rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.619" end="01:04:40.779" style="s2">for those techniques to bind their</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:43.150" style="s2">identity to solving complicated problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.779" end="01:04:44.949" style="s2">in a event-driven way a mathematical way</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.150" end="01:04:46.539" style="s2">these types of ways and then you turn</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.949" end="01:04:50.140" style="s2">around and say oh by the way are you</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.539" end="01:04:53.289" style="s2">Swedish because we only reward Swedes</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.140" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">around here that&#39;s not gonna fly that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.289" end="01:04:57.789" style="s2">that is just a bull that is a mindfuck</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:59.949" style="s2">of an ask you&#39;re not gonna get there so</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.789" end="01:05:01.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even focus on the idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.949" end="01:05:02.499" style="s2">of getting people to go from one</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.150" end="01:05:03.309" style="s2">identity heuristic to another you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.499" end="01:05:05.170" style="s2">just not gonna do it</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.309" end="01:05:11.499" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to move the heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.170" end="01:05:15.640" style="s2">around patches you had a question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.499" end="01:05:18.519" style="s2">gonna meet yourself yeah I got two short</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.640" end="01:05:21.189" style="s2">questions is there a silence a science</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.519" end="01:05:23.499" style="s2">of viral memes is it like a black box AI</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.020" end="01:07:22.570" style="s2">call blue shirts religions and you had</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.650" end="01:07:25.930" style="s2">different identity heuristic orderings</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.570" end="01:07:29.080" style="s2">and you said they were merely mutations</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.930" end="01:07:31.000" style="s2">of the same DNA strand and your</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.080" end="01:07:33.310" style="s2">suggestion or the final slide that</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.000" end="01:07:34.780" style="s2">you&#39;re presenting or seems to me like</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.310" end="01:07:37.090" style="s2">there are just the same identity</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.780" end="01:07:38.530" style="s2">heuristics but in a different order with</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.090" end="01:07:42.940" style="s2">maybe the exception that alchemy is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.530" end="01:07:44.230" style="s2">highest what makes is there something</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.940" end="01:07:46.390" style="s2">that I&#39;m missing that like makes your</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.230" end="01:07:48.850" style="s2">suggested ordering like different than</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.390" end="01:07:52.690" style="s2">just another mutation of the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.850" end="01:07:54.550" style="s2">genetic strand or is it sure yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.690" end="01:07:56.410" style="s2">could elaborate on that makes sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.550" end="01:07:59.200" style="s2">definitely I think I blew through it my</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.410" end="01:08:00.910" style="s2">apologies um and I I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.200" end="01:08:02.200" style="s2">part of me that there was something else</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.910" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">I was supposed to stay on that insulin I</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.200" end="01:08:05.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think I said it so thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:07.570" style="s2">bringing that up the reason why it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.650" end="01:08:09.490" style="s2">blue church isn&#39;t necessarily certain</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.570" end="01:08:11.080" style="s2">types of configurations it&#39;s the fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.490" end="01:08:13.060" style="s2">that it puts alchemy at the end that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.080" end="01:08:14.920" style="s2">what makes it blue church more than</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.060" end="01:08:16.089" style="s2">anything so that&#39;s that&#39;s why it has the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.920" end="01:08:17.680" style="s2">same DNA strain no matter what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.089" end="01:08:21.460" style="s2">configuration is as long as outcome he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.680" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">near the end it&#39;s blue Church so what</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.460" end="01:08:24.849" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:26.529" style="s2">isn&#39;t a system that I want I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.849" end="01:08:28.989" style="s2">what life is like in an automated cult</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.529" end="01:08:31.539" style="s2">arc of city-states I couldn&#39;t even I</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.989" end="01:08:33.309" style="s2">gave some recommendations of what it</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.539" end="01:08:34.719" style="s2">would look and feel like in Auto cults I</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.309" end="01:08:38.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I want to live in such a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.719" end="01:08:42.759" style="s2">world that the reason by this blue</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.230" end="01:08:44.349" style="s2">church the this Kuip of PEG Elian</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.759" end="01:08:46.029" style="s2">critique of the blue church that I just</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.349" end="01:08:50.349" style="s2">walked through on how to completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.029" end="01:08:52.389" style="s2">upend it what I&#39;m saying is if I figure</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.349" end="01:08:54.609" style="s2">this out there are people with resources</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.389" end="01:08:56.230" style="s2">who not only have figured this out but</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.609" end="01:08:58.529" style="s2">they are deploying them and they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.230" end="01:09:01.599" style="s2">going to up that particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.529" end="01:09:04.089" style="s2">identity heuristic combination and what</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.599" end="01:09:06.489" style="s2">will most likely happen in this space is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.089" end="01:09:09.069" style="s2">that all of these other means of</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.489" end="01:09:12.009" style="s2">establishing identity heuristics will</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.069" end="01:09:14.199" style="s2">become either too expensive or pointless</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.009" end="01:09:16.539" style="s2">and the reason why I&#39;m saying that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.199" end="01:09:19.480" style="s2">auto coats will come into play is</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.539" end="01:09:21.909" style="s2">because they will be the only enduring</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.480" end="01:09:24.130" style="s2">identity provider compared to everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.909" end="01:09:27.489" style="s2">else so they will be able to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.130" end="01:09:29.409" style="s2">identities on the fly that actually get</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.489" end="01:09:31.809" style="s2">people involved and get people engaged</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.409" end="01:09:35.109" style="s2">and they see themselves as that tiny</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.809" end="01:09:38.170" style="s2">little aspect of that cult and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.109" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">the only way to actually manifest</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.170" end="01:09:42.219" style="s2">identity in a world where the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:44.829" style="s2">attack the blue church becomes</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.219" end="01:09:46.779" style="s2">exponentially cheaper so I said it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.829" end="01:09:48.969" style="s2">something I want it&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.779" end="01:09:51.029" style="s2">probably the tide of the way things are</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.969" end="01:09:51.029" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.339" end="01:10:05.659" style="s2">thanks Aaron you had a question that</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.719" end="01:10:06.440" style="s2">what is your identity heuristic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.659" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">know if you&#39;re saying you can have</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.440" end="01:10:11.659" style="s2">multiple identity heuristics but where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:14.420" style="s2">yours and how did you arrive at it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.659" end="01:10:16.940" style="s2">just as a political system has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.420" end="01:10:18.619" style="s2">priority of of identity heuristics</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.940" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">humans do to individual humans su as</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.619" end="01:10:21.800" style="s2">well I tend to put alchemy pretty high</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:24.380" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.800" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">only because I&#39;m trying to do something</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.380" end="01:10:27.830" style="s2">that I can&#39;t do so it&#39;s a functional</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:30.260" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s not that I&#39;m out there</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.830" end="01:10:34.159" style="s2">you know sacrificing goats and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.260" end="01:10:36.349" style="s2">using alchemy as a way to try my hand at</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.159" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">getting us the hell off of this planet</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.349" end="01:10:40.489" style="s2">once and for all which I&#39;ve stated</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:41.690" style="s2">multiple times in other videos so I hope</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.489" end="01:10:43.820" style="s2">this isn&#39;t too much of a shock for</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.690" end="01:10:47.300" style="s2">newcomers but the idea is to configure</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.820" end="01:10:48.770" style="s2">the human condition in a way to where</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.300" end="01:10:50.570" style="s2">once they go into space they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.770" end="01:10:52.580" style="s2">leaving you&#39;ve tried that we threw a</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.570" end="01:10:55.730" style="s2">couple things into space go NASA</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.580" end="01:10:57.650" style="s2">Team America but what happened</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.730" end="01:10:59.869" style="s2">well the Saudi Arabians got involved</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.650" end="01:11:01.730" style="s2">they&#39;re like yeah well there&#39;s oil by</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.869" end="01:11:03.230" style="s2">the way and that was it that was the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.730" end="01:11:05.270" style="s2">that&#39;s all they had to do they said oil</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.230" end="01:11:06.920" style="s2">exists and the game was over nobody went</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.270" end="01:11:08.000" style="s2">into space anymore didn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.920" end="01:11:09.710" style="s2">he didn&#39;t have to expand because</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:12.020" style="s2">everybody got trapped in his dumbass oil</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.710" end="01:11:13.099" style="s2">game this this petrol currency game that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.020" end="01:11:14.570" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck in to this day with a</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.099" end="01:11:18.460" style="s2">forever war and all the mess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.570" end="01:11:20.690" style="s2">behind all that stuff so lessons learned</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.460" end="01:11:22.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not enough to trust the eggheads</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.690" end="01:11:23.869" style="s2">and scientists you&#39;re gonna have to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.250" end="01:11:25.580" style="s2">everybody involved and the way to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.869" end="01:11:26.929" style="s2">everybody involved is to alchemy you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.580" end="01:11:29.090" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to do it for sociology</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.929" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">sociology is just a tool</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.090" end="01:11:32.300" style="s2">psychology is just a tool everything</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:34.250" style="s2">everything one of the every single one</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.300" end="01:11:36.260" style="s2">of these are a tool alchemy tends to be</p>

<p begin="01:14:19.750" end="01:14:23.889" style="s2">heuristic or another if you see the game</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.239" end="01:14:25.570" style="s2">and you see the guards and centrally</p>

<p begin="01:18:10.670" end="01:18:14.420" style="s2">look at the numbers you just look at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.920" end="01:18:15.860" style="s2">numbers you don&#39;t cast moral judgment</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.420" end="01:18:17.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not out there saying how dare you</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.860" end="01:18:18.680" style="s2">have 20 abortions what I&#39;m doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.960" end="01:18:20.660" style="s2">not what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.680" end="01:18:24.680" style="s2">I&#39;m just simply looking at the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.660" end="01:18:27.470" style="s2">of the policy so blue church put heavy</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.680" end="01:18:29.210" style="s2">investment on that policy and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.470" end="01:18:30.770" style="s2">because they put so much investment on</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.210" end="01:18:32.150" style="s2">that policy that&#39;s valid battlespace</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.770" end="01:18:35.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a valid place you have to attack</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.150" end="01:18:38.840" style="s2">I hope that makes sense it does but what</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.000" end="01:18:41.780" style="s2">is the NATO identity asymmetry is part</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.840" end="01:18:45.460" style="s2">of it oh that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.780" end="01:18:47.900" style="s2">of diffusing the argument that says a</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.460" end="01:18:49.160" style="s2">fetus isn&#39;t a human which you can say</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.900" end="01:18:51.950" style="s2">okay but are they black</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.160" end="01:18:54.740" style="s2">are they female it&#39;s not a human but is</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.950" end="01:18:56.180" style="s2">it you know is it Indian and then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.740" end="01:18:58.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a point of contention it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.180" end="01:19:00.110" style="s2">that wait a second no how can they be</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.580" end="01:19:01.580" style="s2">black but not a human</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.110" end="01:19:03.650" style="s2">how can they be female if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.580" end="01:19:05.900" style="s2">alive hmm so what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.650" end="01:19:07.610" style="s2">conflating the identity stuff they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.900" end="01:19:09.380" style="s2">already been trained to do and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.610" end="01:19:10.490" style="s2">using it and saying oh by the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.380" end="01:19:13.280" style="s2">going to challenge your definition of</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.490" end="01:19:15.380" style="s2">humanism here so it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.280" end="01:19:24.770" style="s2">maleta it&#39;s a maleta for it&#39;s a red flag</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.380" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">for the bull magnetic caper you had a</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.770" end="01:19:32.060" style="s2">question yeah I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:33.710" style="s2">could distinguish homogenized Asian from</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.060" end="01:19:36.140" style="s2">universalism because you have two</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.710" end="01:19:38.630" style="s2">different strategies I think one of them</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.140" end="01:19:41.620" style="s2">was nomadic contagion and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.630" end="01:19:44.360" style="s2">was some kind of atomization and um I</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.620" end="01:19:46.850" style="s2">think those are two distinct strategies</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.360" end="01:19:48.590" style="s2">right but uh it seems like they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.850" end="01:19:51.280" style="s2">of I&#39;m not clearing the distinction</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.590" end="01:19:54.610" style="s2">between marginalization Universal sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.280" end="01:19:57.470" style="s2">yeah homogenous ation is achieving</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.610" end="01:19:59.690" style="s2">similar psychology stew rationalization</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.470" end="01:20:01.250" style="s2">so that no matter how much the regime</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.690" end="01:20:04.190" style="s2">changes the way they perceive the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.250" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">or have to make a policy shift the</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.190" end="01:20:08.030" style="s2">people turn around and just make excuses</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:10.730" style="s2">for it and now you have a homogenized</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.030" end="01:20:12.440" style="s2">population it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.730" end="01:20:14.440" style="s2">everybody thinking the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.440" end="01:20:16.730" style="s2">everybody rationalizing at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.440" end="01:20:18.320" style="s2">whatever rationalizations they come up</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.730" end="01:20:19.970" style="s2">with is independent than that person but</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.320" end="01:20:21.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the timing of that rationalization</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.970" end="01:20:22.760" style="s2">and the scale of it happening at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.320" end="01:20:25.130" style="s2">same time and that&#39;s done primarily</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.760" end="01:20:26.980" style="s2">through news or elections or time</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.130" end="01:20:29.420" style="s2">scheduled things or stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.980" end="01:20:31.910" style="s2">universalism is is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.420" end="01:20:34.010" style="s2">homogenize ation universalism is is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.910" end="01:20:35.900" style="s2">big umbrella and it&#39;s a big umbrella of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.010" end="01:20:37.610" style="s2">the regime they say kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.900" end="01:20:40.790" style="s2">Romans when the Romans decided to</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.610" end="01:20:42.110" style="s2">conquer a foreign colony well it became</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.790" end="01:20:44.180" style="s2">a foreign colony when they conquered a</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.110" end="01:20:48.050" style="s2">foreign people they would butcher all</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.180" end="01:20:53.049" style="s2">the males they would subjugate the</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.050" end="01:20:55.909" style="s2">females and then they would take a Roman</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.049" end="01:20:58.219" style="s2">not a not a politician</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.909" end="01:21:00.079" style="s2">I forget which rank of the army but a</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.219" end="01:21:01.849" style="s2">very high-ranking individual of the army</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.079" end="01:21:04.819" style="s2">would then come to the area and marry</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.849" end="01:21:06.319" style="s2">into the local population and they would</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.819" end="01:21:08.419" style="s2">say that look we&#39;re just here for the</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.319" end="01:21:09.649" style="s2">resources and the slaves you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.419" end="01:21:11.419" style="s2">about your culture we don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.649" end="01:21:13.429" style="s2">your religion congratulations your</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.419" end="01:21:16.219" style="s2">religion is now part of our pantheon</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.429" end="01:21:17.780" style="s2">you can keep your culture but we just</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.219" end="01:21:18.769" style="s2">you know just keep paying us and if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.780" end="01:21:20.389" style="s2">don&#39;t pay us we&#39;ll just keep stabbing</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.769" end="01:21:23.659" style="s2">you and that was the Roman way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.389" end="01:21:25.549" style="s2">things so that&#39;s universalism</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.659" end="01:21:27.019" style="s2">surprisingly because we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.549" end="01:21:28.969" style="s2">change your cultures we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.019" end="01:21:31.549" style="s2">change the way you think and perceive</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.969" end="01:21:33.439" style="s2">reality keep those in fact that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.549" end="01:21:37.069" style="s2">made you valuable we want to keep that</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.439" end="01:21:39.079" style="s2">intact so universe at universalism is</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.069" end="01:21:41.059" style="s2">kind of like this acceptance of all of</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.079" end="01:21:43.909" style="s2">all cultures and in the Bronze Age it</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.059" end="01:21:46.039" style="s2">actually works pretty damn well</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.909" end="01:21:47.869" style="s2">surprisingly but when you start</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.039" end="01:21:51.139" style="s2">introducing telecommunications that all</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.869" end="01:21:54.549" style="s2"> just over that you can&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.139" end="01:21:54.549" style="s2">sustained universalism anymore</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.329" end="01:22:03.049" style="s2">all right give time for one more</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.899" end="01:22:08.599" style="s2">question Pat Jim quips I think you got</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.049" end="01:22:11.689" style="s2">another question in the chat box that I</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.599" end="01:22:16.339" style="s2">did thank you um sorry I&#39;m go scroll it</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.689" end="01:22:18.229" style="s2">for it yeah is there a way to devote</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.339" end="01:22:20.839" style="s2">your personal resources more equally to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.229" end="01:22:22.519" style="s2">all the heuristics orders limitations of</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.839" end="01:22:24.169" style="s2">our meat bodies slash entropy always</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.519" end="01:22:26.839" style="s2">formed that sort of hierarchy or</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.169" end="01:22:28.789" style="s2">gradient that you&#39;ve presented I know</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.839" end="01:22:30.530" style="s2">that was you were referring to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.789" end="01:22:32.449" style="s2">regime but in our personal lives is</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.530" end="01:22:34.099" style="s2">there a way to even that out and</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.449" end="01:22:35.839" style="s2">basically become like a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.099" end="01:22:37.399" style="s2">jack-of-all-trades as far as applying</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.839" end="01:22:39.769" style="s2">different identity heuristics to</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.399" end="01:22:43.219" style="s2">different situations in life is there or</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.769" end="01:22:44.809" style="s2">are we is our brain do our brains always</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.219" end="01:22:47.269" style="s2">through efficiency and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.809" end="01:22:49.909" style="s2">thing always form that that hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.269" end="01:22:51.619" style="s2">hierarchy or gradient when are certain</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.909" end="01:22:53.539" style="s2">heuristics are getting more resources</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.619" end="01:22:56.389" style="s2">than others even in our personal lives</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.539" end="01:22:57.079" style="s2">valid question yes there is a way but</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.389" end="01:22:58.549" style="s2">it&#39;s not forever</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.079" end="01:23:01.579" style="s2">you have a window in which you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.549" end="01:23:05.539" style="s2">you have to do it when when the human is</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.579" end="01:23:06.289" style="s2">young between the ages of 8 and 20 is</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.539" end="01:23:09.230" style="s2">your window</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.289" end="01:23:11.599" style="s2">after that they formed personal lives or</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.230" end="01:23:13.940" style="s2">they have families or they get jobs and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.599" end="01:23:15.639" style="s2">careers and they got to do that forever</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.940" end="01:23:18.079" style="s2">the way to do it is discipline</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.639" end="01:23:20.739" style="s2">discipline of saying okay discipline of</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.079" end="01:23:23.900" style="s2">the mind this is one of the self I</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.739" end="01:23:26.929" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any or identity destroyed as</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.900" end="01:23:28.429" style="s2">a child is always tough it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.929" end="01:23:30.789" style="s2">traumatic it&#39;s a big source of trauma</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.429" end="01:23:32.780" style="s2">but if you can do structure</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.789" end="01:23:34.460" style="s2">deconstruction of identity while the</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.780" end="01:23:37.070" style="s2">person is still a child and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.460" end="01:23:39.139" style="s2">influence it to favor one identity</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.070" end="01:23:41.230" style="s2">heuristic over another then what you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.139" end="01:23:44.809" style="s2">do is you get the kind of training that</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.230" end="01:23:47.090" style="s2">that Alec that Aristotle gave Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.809" end="01:23:50.030" style="s2">where the idea is that here are the</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.090" end="01:23:52.849" style="s2">tools of human psychology use them</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.030" end="01:23:54.619" style="s2">wisely do not get married into one do</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.849" end="01:23:57.079" style="s2">not pick one is your identity these are</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.619" end="01:23:58.969" style="s2">just tools you use them as you need them</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.079" end="01:24:02.389" style="s2">but that type of training is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.969" end="01:24:05.449" style="s2">available for everyone it&#39;s hard to find</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.389" end="01:24:07.400" style="s2">that type of stuff so basically what</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.449" end="01:24:09.050" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is as a 34 year old man</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.400" end="01:24:12.219" style="s2">child with no curry he loses his mother</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.050" end="01:24:12.219" style="s2">I still have time</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.559" end="01:24:17.000" style="s2">you have time to learn it do you have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.409" end="01:24:19.369" style="s2">practice it well you have time to</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.000" end="01:24:21.710" style="s2">practice it but do you are you free for</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.369" end="01:24:23.329" style="s2">metalli ation the answer is no yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.710" end="01:24:26.510" style="s2">guess the play church will come for me</p>
