<p begin="00:01:26.980" end="00:01:27.860" style="s2">Oh, ha alright</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:34.480" style="s2">I should welcome my extension school students, who will be looking at this tomorrow night.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.480" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">Okay, you turn to the back of the syllabus</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:39.720" style="s2">Where it says 2: Calendar Events</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.260" end="00:02:35.000" style="s2">This is a course about the causes of social conflict.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.420" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">I’m not interested in social conflict from the perspective of a political scientist or a sociologist.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">I’m interested in intergroup conflict, but not at the level of group analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:55.340" style="s2">I’m interested in what role social identity or group identity plays in individual psychology...</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.340" end="00:03:00.440" style="s2">and why it is that individuals are motivated to participate in acts of social conflict.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.840" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">I am using for an example here the Holocaust.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">I was thinking last week...</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.980" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">writing part of the preface to the book that you&#39;re going to read...</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:12.380" style="s2">about the Holocaust Museum in Washington [DC]</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.380" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">Now there&#39;s a lot of--obviously this is a museum to the Jews, primarily, who were killed by the Nazis in World War 2.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:26.060" style="s2">There are a number of museums like this throughout the world, and their central motto is “never forget.”</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:28.800" style="s2">This has always been confusing to me:</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.800" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">this notion of “never forget(ting)”</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.400" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">because I don’t think you can remember something that you don’t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">And I don’t think we understand why the Holocaust happened in World War 2.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:46.780" style="s2">I think you might regard the Holocaust as an unlearned lesson.</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.780" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">And I don’t think you can process information you don’t comprehend.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">So to say “never forget” begs the question: “what is it you’re supposed to remember?”</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:03:59.560" style="s2">Is it the fact that 6 million people were killed?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.560" end="00:04:01.960" style="s2">Is it the fact of that particular event, or</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.960" end="00:04:07.580" style="s2">are you supposed to be giving some consideration to Holocaust-like events that have occurred through history?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.740" end="00:04:13.580" style="s2">Because there are people who think that what happened in World War 2 was a relatively unique event— of  something unparalleled in history.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:16.640" style="s2">This is not a position that I adopt.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.700" end="00:04:19.880" style="s2">I think, actually, it’s a very common sort of event.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.880" end="00:04:21.880" style="s2">It was perhaps…</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">It was the event of that sort that has proved most shocking to the European conscience, so to speak-</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.160" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">but it hardly strikes me as unique.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">People often talk about the Holocaust in terms of the relationship between the Jews and the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">or between the Jews and the Nazis.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.120" end="00:04:48.820" style="s2">The Jews obviously playing the part of victims and the Nazis often—are always--playing the part of the perpetrators.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.820" end="00:04:51.980" style="s2">And, of course, this is absolutely comprehensible from the historical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:53.200" style="s2">but it also strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.320" end="00:04:56.840" style="s2">if what we remember is that the Nazis killed the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.840" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">then we’re already on the road to making a mistake that’s similar</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.200" end="00:05:03.640" style="s2">to the mistake that was made that led to the Holocaust to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">which is to identify characteristics that lead to patterns of action of that sort.</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">As characteristics of groups!</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.580" end="00:05:13.100" style="s2">Identifiable groups.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.100" end="00:05:20.020" style="s2">And it is seems to me... I mean, I’m not try to equate the role of the Jews and the Nazis in producing the Holocaust—that would be obviously absurd.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.280" end="00:05:22.280" style="s2">What I’m trying to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.280" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">the lesson seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:31.480" style="s2">especially when you consider the propensity for Holocaust-like events is deeply rooted in human nature.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:39.380" style="s2">The lesson to draw from the events of World War 2 is that: that’s what human beings are like--not what the Nazis were like.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">Because these sorts of events happen all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:47.340" style="s2">It’s obviously the case that there are, well, in the 20th century alone</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">the English invented the Concentration Camp in South Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">Germans perfected it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.100" end="00:05:56.100" style="s2">Chinese used it to great advantage.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn estimated--I&#39;ll show this on the next slide--that 66 million people in the Soviet Union were killed as a consequence of internal repression,</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">many of whom went through camp-like procedures on the road to their demise.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.900" end="00:06:15.340" style="s2">We see ethnic cleansing occurring in places like Rwanda and even once again in Europe: <br />in the Balkans.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">Whatever it was that we were supposed to have learned from the events of the Second World War hasn’t been learned, nor been remembered,</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">because you can’t remember what you don’t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:27.720" style="s2">That’s what this course is about.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:36.760" style="s2">I’ve been working since 1985 I guess on trying to figure out what it is about people...</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.760" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">Remember Hannah Arendt.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">Maybe you know this, maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.480" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">She’s a famous political scientist.</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">She was a student of Martin Heidegger.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">She wrote a book called “The Banality of Evil.”</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">One of her points was that--these people—</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.960" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">she was talking about the Nazis in particular—</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.520" end="00:06:53.080" style="s2">people who perpetrated events like this—</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.320" end="00:06:56.480" style="s2">if you meet them, if you talk to them, if you have encounter with them—</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.760" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">the thing that’s often striking about them is not their striking abnormality</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">or their evident evil</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.760" end="00:07:05.480" style="s2">but the fact that they are much like other people that you might have met,</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.480" end="00:07:08.480" style="s2">which I suppose might not be so surprising when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.480" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">how thoroughly, for example, the Nazi movement dominated the German consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:15.200" style="s2">or, likewise, with Communism in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.200" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">Those ideological movements characterized people!</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:22.840" style="s2">They didn’t characterize some strange sort of misfits</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.200" end="00:07:27.320" style="s2">whose consciousness was characterized by something incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.320" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">that led them to perform the kind of actions that we’re theoretically supposed to remember.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">My perspective on all this is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.720" end="00:07:40.920" style="s2">the fact that people are capable of perpetrating atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.920" end="00:07:43.720" style="s2">like those that characterized the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.040" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">says something about what people are like.</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">What everybody is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">because it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">that kind of tendency is something that’s deeply rooted in human nature.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:56.640" style="s2">And then to say that, well, “What was it about the Nazis?”</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:01.200" style="s2">or “What was it about the Soviet Communists that led them to participate in this sort of behavior?”</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.200" end="00:08:03.760" style="s2">is completely besides the point, in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.920" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">All that does is: you’re looking for some sort of group characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:10.600" style="s2">that is devoid—you don’t have any personal relationship with that group.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.600" end="00:08:12.440" style="s2">The problem is instantly made abstract.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.440" end="00:08:14.440" style="s2">As far as I’m concerned, if it is abstract,</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.440" end="00:08:16.440" style="s2">well then, once again,</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.440" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">nothing is remembered.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">Now what I want to do is,</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:27.080" style="s2">To try to... I want to outline the reasons why something like the Holocaust should have occurred.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.320" end="00:08:31.720" style="s2">What it is about us that makes us so concerned with protecting our group identities.</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.720" end="00:08:35.040" style="s2">What these identities mean.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.080" end="00:08:36.840" style="s2">What role they play in the regulation of emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.960" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">That’s the critical thing, right there:</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.280" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">for me, ideologies are the expression--in a sense--the verbal expression of the internal structures that regulate our emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2">When you mess around with someone’s ideologies, therefore,</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:56.960" style="s2">as a consequence, you’re messing around with the inhibitory structure that regulates the interplay between their emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">So we&#39;re gonna study, in part, in this course, what emotions are and...</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:03.640" style="s2">how they are rooted in neuropsychology and neurophysiology and ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.640" end="00:09:06.920" style="s2">how they manifest themselves in behavior, how they might be controlled</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:07.160" style="s2">I also hope to make - as I said, I want to make - the lessons here personal.</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.740" end="00:10:13.520" style="s2">I am not interested in discussing the issue from the abstract perspective because I don&#39;t think that...</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.520" end="00:10:20.660" style="s2">an issue of this magnitude deserves to be discussed at an abstract level.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.660" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">It&#39;s not an abstract problem.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">There&#39;s something peculiar about us that we have to learn to control because...</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned, ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:36.540" style="s2">we&#39;re too technologically powerful to remain at the whimps of the uncomprehend aspects of our nature.</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.480" end="00:10:45.300" style="s2">&quot;Peace, predicatbility and the delusion of self-representation&quot;. Well, what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.760" end="00:10:52.200" style="s2">Well, if you can predict something, as a general rule... like, it&#39;s hard to determine ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.380" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">why it is that you think that you understand something when you think you do.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:04.180" style="s2">If you think about it for a moment, it gets complicated becaue you&#39;re surrounded by things that...</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.180" end="00:11:07.280" style="s2">at some level of analysis, you seize to understand.</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.280" end="00:11:09.800" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t matter what phenomena it is.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.800" end="00:11:15.560" style="s2">Even the most mondain objects become mysterious if you look into them far enough.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.560" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">You take something as simple as a chair. It&#39;s made out of wood. That&#39;s all. There is nothing remarkable about that.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:26.700" style="s2">But if you start looking into the structure of the wood, how the organism, the tree, produced it and...</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.700" end="00:11:31.460" style="s2">all the chemical reactions that go about, bringing that about and the development of history that led to ...</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.460" end="00:11:38.900" style="s2">the emergence of plants and trees. Well, you can see that even in something mondain are embedded all sorts of mysteries.</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:22.240" style="s2">Let me step one step back.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.240" end="01:11:23.360" style="s2">What&#39;s Emotion?</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.580" end="01:11:27.940" style="s2">Emotion is the subjective sensation that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.940" end="01:11:32.340" style="s2">when you encounter a situation that has implications for action.</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.340" end="01:11:39.820" style="s2">Emotion occupies the space between sensory input and motor output</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.820" end="01:11:42.920" style="s2">If you encounter something that has significance</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.620" end="01:11:44.980" style="s2">You feel an emotion;</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.980" end="01:11:49.780" style="s2">and an emotion is the subjective sense that accompanies the activation or pre-activation of motor output systems.</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.780" end="01:11:52.200" style="s2">Thats basically how it occurs, appears.</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.460" end="01:11:53.340" style="s2">You say well...</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.620" end="01:11:58.300" style="s2">You can think of the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.380" end="01:12:00.380" style="s2">The way that we normally think</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.380" end="01:12:03.060" style="s2">Which is as something that exists objectively</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.060" end="01:12:05.860" style="s2">and something that is amenable to scientific description</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.360" end="01:12:11.440" style="s2">Or you can think of it as a place that is full of things that has implications for actions.</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.380" end="01:12:16.360" style="s2">As far as stories are concerned</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.820" end="01:12:21.420" style="s2">The universe is  full of things that has implications for actions.</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.680" end="01:12:25.160" style="s2">That&#39;s the environment from the narrative perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.760" end="01:12:30.240" style="s2">The most fundamental substructure of narratives can become myths</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.360" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">The next thing I want to show you is how myths fundamentally represent the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:39.540" style="s2">In so far as its conceived of as something that has implications for behavior.</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.240" end="01:12:43.280" style="s2">Something that has emotional significance.</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.280" end="01:12:46.820" style="s2">See, the world of the scientific option, so to speak, <br />Is devoid of emotional significance.</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.800" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">Really by design. Part of what you do in the scientific procedure is eradicate anything that is purely subjective like emotion.</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.460" end="01:13:02.460" style="s2">If you think a theory is true because you like the theory then that is not sufficient grounds for considering it to be true from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.140" end="01:13:11.140" style="s2">You are supposed to make yourself objective. Which basically means to eradicate your emotional assessment of a given situation.</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.140" end="01:13:16.340" style="s2">The thing is that we are always assessing situations for their affective significance.</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.700" end="01:13:20.380" style="s2">We have to do that because emotions or affect means how to act.</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.960" end="01:13:22.320" style="s2">In every situation.</p>
