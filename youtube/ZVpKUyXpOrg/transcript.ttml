<p begin="00:00:44.610" end="00:00:49.309" style="s2">working on a documentary about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">grievant Studies affair</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.309" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">it&#39;s Peter Boghossian James Lindsay and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">Helen Black Rose were submitting hoax</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">articles to academic journals to test</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">the political biases of certain academic</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">fields and I got tangled up in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:07.229" style="s2">project with with them before they</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">started writing so I&#39;ve been filming the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.229" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">process all the way through so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">going back and forth between Australia</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">and here for I&#39;d say near on two years</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">now when&#39;s the first time we met it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">at the James to more event it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">was it the James to more event yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">met you through Peter I also met James</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">and Helen through Peter and so we met at</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">the d&#39;amour event and then I think the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">next time we met would have been maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">you guys came over to our place yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah it would have been that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">and so just to catch people up you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">working on the grievance studies affair</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">mm-hmm and you were documenting it as it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">unfolded yeah and at some level the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">evergreen affair was tangential to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">yes it was happening locally because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">knew Peter and so you looked into it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:06.689" style="s2">be kind of a I don&#39;t know a side light</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">or an added dimension</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">yeah the what you were working on yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">and at the point that you started</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.069" style="s2">looking into</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:15.969" style="s2">the Evergreen situation it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.069" end="00:02:18.469" style="s2">difficult to turn it into a small</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.969" end="00:02:20.900" style="s2">snapshot very much so yeah there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.469" end="00:02:22.609" style="s2">much depth to it so the gravity of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.900" end="00:02:24.439" style="s2">Evergreen story you kind of get you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.609" end="00:02:26.209" style="s2">drawn into it and you&#39;re like holy crap</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.439" end="00:02:28.849" style="s2">what is what has actually happened to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.209" end="00:02:31.819" style="s2">you yeah it&#39;s a modern-day witch burning</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.849" end="00:02:34.790" style="s2">really it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s and as you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.819" end="00:02:37.430" style="s2">not even figuratively yeah people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.790" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">orchestrated it much to my amazement I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.430" end="00:02:41.870" style="s2">did not know this at the time but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:45.260" style="s2">people who orchestrated it viewed it as</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.870" end="00:02:47.480" style="s2">a justified witch hunt yeah that because</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.260" end="00:02:49.879" style="s2">I was white and male and yes straight</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.480" end="00:02:51.709" style="s2">that I was deserving of being which</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.879" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">haunted yeah in order to give me the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.709" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">same experience that others have had</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:59.329" style="s2">well your image became an effigy which</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">they then but repeatedly here all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.329" end="00:03:03.079" style="s2">so um so you came to the Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:05.389" style="s2">affair at the point that you realized</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.079" end="00:03:08.859" style="s2">that it was its own story and you made</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.389" end="00:03:12.409" style="s2">what I regard as an absolutely beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.859" end="00:03:14.349" style="s2">three-part documentary which people can</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.409" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2">find I will link it in the description</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.349" end="00:03:19.609" style="s2">and that documentary is a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:22.669" style="s2">different things I mean I must say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.609" end="00:03:24.500" style="s2">personally very meaningful to me at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.669" end="00:03:27.709" style="s2">number of different levels there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.500" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">in which it solved a problem that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.709" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">inherent to where Heather and I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.930" end="00:03:37.099" style="s2">landed and the problem was that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:40.099" style="s2">predicament was almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.099" end="00:03:44.510" style="s2">fathom from any mmm normal position</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.099" end="00:03:45.590" style="s2">because it was so odd and that created a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.510" end="00:03:47.239" style="s2">kind of alienation</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:48.949" style="s2">because interacting with other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.239" end="00:03:50.150" style="s2">they would say old can you explain you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.949" end="00:03:54.169" style="s2">know what happened at Evergreen just</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:58.819" style="s2">briefly and it was like no no yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.169" end="00:04:00.829" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s more even if one attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.819" end="00:04:03.290" style="s2">describe it at length describing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.829" end="00:04:05.299" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite cut it no so Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.290" end="00:04:07.129" style="s2">Voice had done a lot of work necessary</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.299" end="00:04:08.689" style="s2">for people to understand what happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.129" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">he unearthed a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.689" end="00:04:13.099" style="s2">stuff and without a lot of it and very</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.739" style="s2">interesting former Jerseyans ooh gruel</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.099" end="00:04:18.349" style="s2">to my film as well right and then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.739" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">you picked up a lot of what he had</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.349" end="00:04:23.810" style="s2">unearthed yeah and you put it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">very cinematic form yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.810" end="00:04:30.139" style="s2">and anyway the the net outgrowth of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.940" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">was the things I thought nobody was ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.139" end="00:04:33.860" style="s2">really going to understand and not what</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">happened at Evergreen things that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.860" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">remember even in real time sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:39.620" style="s2">the canoe meeting for example yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">sitting in the canoe meeting one of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">thoughts was what is going on here is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">jaw-dropping hmm there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:52.550" style="s2">convey what has happened yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:54.500" style="s2">outsiders and your films they solved</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.550" end="00:04:56.630" style="s2">that problem as they did convey it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.500" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">and so that was a big weight off my</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.630" end="00:05:02.030" style="s2">shoulders well that particular piece of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:04.430" style="s2">footage was the reason why I sought you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">out because so we&#39;d met and not only</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.430" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">loosely heard about the Evergreen the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.759" end="00:05:12.319" style="s2">events at Evergreen and then after</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:15.860" style="s2">meeting you I went and did some homework</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.319" end="00:05:18.199" style="s2">and read the Washington Examiner piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.860" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">that you guys had and it linked to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.199" end="00:05:23.270" style="s2">piece of footage and it was a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:24.770" style="s2">because I was working on the grievant</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.270" end="00:05:28.580" style="s2">study stuff and I was quite a few months</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.770" end="00:05:30.740" style="s2">in reading the scholarly Canon I guess</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.580" end="00:05:34.699" style="s2">and the the major texts around that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.740" end="00:05:38.180" style="s2">what was looking to me like was some</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.699" end="00:05:41.780" style="s2">some kind of victimhood theology so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.180" end="00:05:42.889" style="s2">was calling it because the the peer</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.780" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">review comments that the guys were</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.889" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">getting back for the fake papers that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:47.990" style="s2">were writing but very it was paying</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:50.419" style="s2">lip-service to the scientific method and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.990" end="00:05:54.319" style="s2">and rigor but it was really what it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.419" end="00:05:57.319" style="s2">policing was some kind of it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.319" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">a set of moral rules and they were cut</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.319" end="00:06:01.699" style="s2">and I was slowly figuring out what this</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">was which because it wasn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.699" end="00:06:05.090" style="s2">science they were they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:07.789" style="s2">sort out here it was some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.090" end="00:06:10.490" style="s2">intuitive moral system that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.789" end="00:06:12.530" style="s2">creating and so it&#39;s it really did start</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.490" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">looking like some kind of theology to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.530" end="00:06:17.139" style="s2">it was it was very young like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:20.449" style="s2">prescriptive sociology that was based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.139" end="00:06:22.520" style="s2">moral intuitions and I was like well how</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.449" end="00:06:24.409" style="s2">do I convey that because it&#39;s all paper</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.520" end="00:06:25.669" style="s2">and it&#39;s all words and comments and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.409" end="00:06:27.169" style="s2">things like that and it took me a long</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.669" end="00:06:28.789" style="s2">time to figure out that this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.169" end="00:06:30.680" style="s2">potentially what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.789" end="00:06:33.589" style="s2">then I saw that footage and I was like</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.589" end="00:06:36.949" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.889" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing in there scholarship and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.949" end="00:06:41.240" style="s2">major texts are there working is he this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:44.689" style="s2">is this is like the it&#39;s the natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:47.210" style="s2">progression of what I imagine a theology</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.689" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">would would create so you mean when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.210" end="00:06:49.879" style="s2">say this is a service you mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.569" style="s2">religious service you&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.879" end="00:06:55.370" style="s2">they&#39;ve done us a service by provider</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.569" end="00:06:58.039" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because I had the OP had the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.370" end="00:06:59.810" style="s2">other reaction while I was sitting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.039" end="00:07:02.569" style="s2">because you know they set this thing up</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.810" end="00:07:06.919" style="s2">they strongly encouraged us to go to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.569" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">this media and when I got there they had</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.919" end="00:07:10.759" style="s2">you know they have these very fancy</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:12.620" style="s2">television cameras they have a TV studio</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.759" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">that they outfitted and it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.620" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">a complaint amongst faculty that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:17.930" style="s2">underutilized right and the bridges</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.529" style="s2">administration started using these</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.930" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">cameras they filmed everything and thank</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.529" end="00:07:29.659" style="s2">for that but anyway I walk in there and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.979" end="00:07:35.719" style="s2">these cameras are set up right and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.659" end="00:07:38.029" style="s2">begin to realize how how they view what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.719" end="00:07:40.279" style="s2">they&#39;re doing yeah and then as the thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.029" end="00:07:42.650" style="s2">unfolds you know it&#39;s been billed as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.279" end="00:07:45.349" style="s2">forum to discuss the plan but yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.650" end="00:07:47.210" style="s2">room to discuss anything other than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.349" end="00:07:50.599" style="s2">goodness of its objectives</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.210" end="00:07:52.610" style="s2">yes utopian view of things and as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.599" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">sitting there I&#39;m thinking okay nobody</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.610" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">is ever gonna understand this I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:57.439" style="s2">explain it it&#39;s gonna be hard enough to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">explain to Heather and she knew that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.439" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">movie was coming and in fact she said</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:03.949" style="s2">you have to go to this yeah right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:06.649" style="s2">she wasn&#39;t going to things but I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.949" end="00:08:07.969" style="s2">going religiously as it were to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.649" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">everything because there was so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.969" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">going on but I I guess maybe I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:14.300" style="s2">even realized that there was a meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:16.069" style="s2">he&#39;s like no no no you gotta go but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.300" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna be able to explain it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.069" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">her because it was so far beyond yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:23.270" style="s2">the most extreme thing I had yet seen it</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.930" end="00:08:25.279" style="s2">seen at that point and then as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.270" end="00:08:28.210" style="s2">sitting there I&#39;m thinking they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.279" end="00:08:31.550" style="s2">filming this yeah and then I thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.210" end="00:08:34.519" style="s2">there&#39;s no way that they are dumb enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:38.810" style="s2">to allow that footage out and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.519" end="00:08:42.169" style="s2">trying to figure out can I force them to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.810" end="00:08:44.149" style="s2">release it before they delete it which</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.169" end="00:08:45.300" style="s2">any reasonable person who had done what</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.149" end="00:08:49.019" style="s2">they were doing would have done</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.300" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">because that footage is very clear right</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.019" end="00:08:53.300" style="s2">how far around the bend this movement</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.040" style="s2">was for us no for them</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.300" end="00:08:58.860" style="s2">exactly so anyway to somewhere there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.040" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">an email in which I emailed them after</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.860" end="00:09:03.149" style="s2">the event it&#39;s like I do think the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:05.190" style="s2">entire community not everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.149" end="00:09:07.709" style="s2">present I do think the entire community</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.190" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">needs to see the footage of that meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.709" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">when can we expect it yeah trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.980" style="s2">prompt them yeah but they were proud of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:17.579" style="s2">it and they put it out much to my</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.980" end="00:09:20.370" style="s2">surprise and and you made excellent use</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.579" end="00:09:24.329" style="s2">of it it is an interesting thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.370" end="00:09:26.910" style="s2">heart of the Evergreen moral panic I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.329" end="00:09:28.769" style="s2">that how proud everyone was there was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.910" end="00:09:30.180" style="s2">lot of footage of that it&#39;s this huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.769" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">from my perspective this huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.180" end="00:09:35.550" style="s2">sociological event like it was really</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:38.490" style="s2">the case study for this this way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.550" end="00:09:40.649" style="s2">thinking and the fact that everyone was</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.490" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">so proud to put up did they filmed</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.649" end="00:09:44.519" style="s2">everything in pride they filmed it</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:46.529" style="s2">because they were proud of it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.519" end="00:09:48.570" style="s2">seeing all these horrific things from my</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.529" end="00:09:50.100" style="s2">position outside of that moral community</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.570" end="00:09:52.529" style="s2">going what the hell is going on here why</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">would you be proud of that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.529" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">series was just kind of an accidental</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.950" style="s2">series I kind of stumbled into it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:01.529" style="s2">more or less just that really it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.950" end="00:10:03.570" style="s2">and my perspective of the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.529" end="00:10:04.770" style="s2">they&#39;re probably still proud of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.570" end="00:10:08.550" style="s2">still doubling down on this way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.770" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">thinking still yeah even like as of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.550" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">week they are so W loved to sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">watch that series next to like George or</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:18.450" style="s2">Naima and saw some questions I really</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.329" style="s2">want to hang out with these guys I agree</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.450" end="00:10:22.980" style="s2">I think this is it may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.329" end="00:10:25.260" style="s2">possible because they they did figure</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.980" end="00:10:28.980" style="s2">out one thing right away which was that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.260" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">every time they touched media outside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.980" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">their little bubble it did not play well</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:34.910" style="s2">you can&#39;t get him you can&#39;t get anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:37.649" style="s2">like the amount of people I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.910" end="00:10:39.390" style="s2">reach out to and talk about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.649" end="00:10:40.920" style="s2">as soon as they get a hint I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.390" end="00:10:43.410" style="s2">hostile media environment so you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.920" end="00:10:44.579" style="s2">kind of like for everyone so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.410" end="00:10:47.399" style="s2">wants to put a camera on you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.579" end="00:10:51.390" style="s2">looking for a friendly but but Eve even</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.399" end="00:10:55.020" style="s2">so you know look I know you I know me</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.390" end="00:10:57.390" style="s2">yeah the fact is I would give him a fair</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.020" end="00:11:00.780" style="s2">shot and I think you know as</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.390" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">as we&#39;ve talked about repeatedly there</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.780" end="00:11:04.950" style="s2">are a lot of these concepts that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:07.020" style="s2">something true in yeah somewhere yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.950" end="00:11:09.180" style="s2">right and then they&#39;ve been distorted so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.020" end="00:11:11.610" style="s2">grotesquely and they become you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.180" end="00:11:13.530" style="s2">basis for a witch-hunt yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.610" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">lot to talk about and so anyway it would</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.530" end="00:11:17.700" style="s2">be fascinating if they would interact</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:19.590" style="s2">but they have this litmus test either</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.700" end="00:11:21.090" style="s2">you will sign up for these things when</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.590" end="00:11:23.880" style="s2">yes so far beyond the pale that no</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.090" end="00:11:25.050" style="s2">reasonable person will yeah or we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.880" end="00:11:27.030" style="s2">talk to you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.050" end="00:11:29.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s just simply where where it</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.030" end="00:11:32.070" style="s2">stands but you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.730" end="00:11:34.350" style="s2">their pride and their it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.070" end="00:11:37.670" style="s2">pride their certitude that what they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.350" end="00:11:40.020" style="s2">doing is still correct they&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.670" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">the only thing they&#39;ve learned is not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.020" end="00:11:45.780" style="s2">talk to people it will record them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:47.460" style="s2">but I would say I see no evidence of any</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.780" end="00:11:49.500" style="s2">other learning of any kind and that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.460" end="00:11:52.620" style="s2">maybe the greatest tragedy well it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.500" end="00:11:55.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the blinkers Hyde says morality</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.620" end="00:11:58.770" style="s2">binds and blinds and so from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.700" end="00:12:00.870" style="s2">religious stance I&#39;m using it as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.770" end="00:12:02.010" style="s2">descriptive tool this religious way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.870" end="00:12:03.570" style="s2">looking at it and I think it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.010" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">powerful one to understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.570" end="00:12:07.800" style="s2">hell&#39;s going on there but from a calm</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:12.390" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.800" end="00:12:13.800" style="s2">a religion is a moral community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.390" end="00:12:15.780" style="s2">gathered around a group of stories and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.800" end="00:12:16.980" style="s2">scriptures and so I started looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.780" end="00:12:19.620" style="s2">the stories and scriptures and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.980" end="00:12:21.330" style="s2">figure that out and then to better</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.620" end="00:12:23.250" style="s2">understand the moral community but they</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.330" end="00:12:24.630" style="s2">they can&#39;t see outside of it that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.250" end="00:12:26.850" style="s2">all these crazy stuff is happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.630" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">because inside the bubble it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.850" end="00:12:31.160" style="s2">but as soon as you&#39;re outside of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:36.960" style="s2">clown world</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.160" end="00:12:39.900" style="s2">it&#39;s clown world and it is also you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.960" end="00:12:42.200" style="s2">what Heather and I spent a year saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.900" end="00:12:46.070" style="s2">in the aftermath of this was that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.200" end="00:12:48.990" style="s2">evergreen was really set up to serve</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.070" end="00:12:50.910" style="s2">underserved communities mmm it was the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.990" end="00:12:53.820" style="s2">college for people who were not a good</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.820" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">people who were not a good fit for other</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.960" end="00:13:00.300" style="s2">places were people from you know racial</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:02.760" style="s2">backgrounds that were disadvantaged or</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.300" end="00:13:05.070" style="s2">had some other unusual feature to their</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.760" end="00:13:07.790" style="s2">story and they really needed faculty to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.070" end="00:13:10.200" style="s2">deal with them as individuals which</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.790" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">evergreen the structure of it made</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:18.650" style="s2">so what is very hard for us to get past</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.500" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">is that evergreen was not highly</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.650" end="00:13:22.550" style="s2">functional at the point it came apart</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:24.140" style="s2">but it was still functional and it could</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.550" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">easily have been fixed mmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.140" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">what they did instead was they destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.810" end="00:13:30.380" style="s2">the functional part which was</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:33.110" style="s2">well-suited to serve people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.380" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">usually underserved and replaced it with</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">a myth that is incapable of serving</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:41.210" style="s2">anybody and in fact it it does the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.560" end="00:13:43.820" style="s2">opposite it leads them to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.210" end="00:13:47.660" style="s2">there is some sort of help to be had</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.820" end="00:13:50.660" style="s2">from you know from wallowing in victim</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.660" end="00:13:52.280" style="s2">mmm-hmm which frankly isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.660" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">work it&#39;s the saddest part about this I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.280" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s all about empowering</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:58.640" style="s2">communities I&#39;ve couldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:14:01.970" style="s2">disempower community more by getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.640" end="00:14:02.960" style="s2">them to build their I&#39;d entered entity</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.970" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">around their victimhood</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.960" end="00:14:07.130" style="s2">which is this sacred totem that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:09.620" style="s2">have to build their identity around</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.130" end="00:14:11.570" style="s2">victimhood and to reject the very tools</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.620" end="00:14:14.150" style="s2">that would empower them most and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.570" end="00:14:15.950" style="s2">are the antidote to bias and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.150" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">everyone&#39;s tools like I mean they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.950" end="00:14:19.430" style="s2">the whole its masters tools don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">touch the Masters tools will never</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.430" end="00:14:23.750" style="s2">dismantle the Masters house house but</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:25.580" style="s2">they&#39;re your fucking tools like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.750" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s tools and humanity has taken</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.580" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">a long time to get to these tools</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.339" style="s2">they&#39;re like the most beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:35.180" style="s2">that anyone can pick up I gotta tell you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.339" end="00:14:36.710" style="s2">the master has the best tool his quality</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.180" end="00:14:38.420" style="s2">stuff and if you want to take down his</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.710" end="00:14:41.750" style="s2">house that&#39;s the place to find the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.420" end="00:14:44.390" style="s2">with the power to do it yeah and so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.750" end="00:14:46.520" style="s2">know I do want to say I&#39;m certain that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.390" end="00:14:49.460" style="s2">Audrey Lord meant something by that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.520" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">quote that you know I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.460" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">argue with it even at in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:55.820" style="s2">she meant it yeah the way that it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:15:00.740" style="s2">utilized is absolutely self destructive</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.820" end="00:15:02.540" style="s2">and you know science this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.740" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">counter-intuitive - we&#39;ve used science</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.540" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">as this very powerful paradigm it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:07.640" style="s2">very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:10.310" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s powerful is that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.640" end="00:15:12.589" style="s2">corrects for bias that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.310" end="00:15:14.270" style="s2">a confirmation bias problem and science</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.589" end="00:15:15.890" style="s2">is the thing that allows us to see past</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.270" end="00:15:18.500" style="s2">it and so to the extent that one</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.890" end="00:15:20.510" style="s2">believes civilization is biased against</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.500" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">people the tool you that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.510" end="00:15:24.140" style="s2">hone is scientific and so to attack</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:26.210" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.140" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">to entak enlightenment values to attack</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.210" end="00:15:34.490" style="s2">the idea of merit and then substitute in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">this religious view of who is deserving</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.490" end="00:15:37.520" style="s2">on the basis of what characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:42.640" style="s2">that they walked through the door with</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.520" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">is just it&#39;s it&#39;s the most ironic</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.640" end="00:15:47.150" style="s2">self-sabotage imaginable but there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:49.280" style="s2">this sense that this is very much like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.150" end="00:15:51.620" style="s2">the original post modernist akule I like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.280" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">them and so they get a lot of flack for</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.620" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but deep inside it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:06.950" style="s2">this sense that I&#39;m so deep deep inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:08.660" style="s2">the Foucauldian view is that that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.950" end="00:16:10.940" style="s2">is science right but there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.660" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">branding of science so science gets kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.940" end="00:16:17.900" style="s2">of used it used as weapons for</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:20.360" style="s2">absolutely powerful yep and so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.900" end="00:16:21.590" style="s2">what&#39;s happened with this next iteration</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.360" end="00:16:23.420" style="s2">is they&#39;re going for actually the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.590" end="00:16:27.800" style="s2">beautiful thing in the middle instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.420" end="00:16:30.290" style="s2">the surrounding uses of science so if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.800" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">kind of laid down the the blueprint of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.290" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">how knowledge works and our power works</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:37.130" style="s2">through that knowledge and they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:39.080" style="s2">adopted that to create their own version</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.130" end="00:16:41.840" style="s2">of the worst part of that does that make</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:44.630" style="s2">sense to you and so it is working in so</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.840" end="00:16:45.890" style="s2">far as that blueprint is true like I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.630" end="00:16:48.920" style="s2">think that they&#39;re really they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.890" end="00:16:50.570" style="s2">these these applied post modernist these</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.920" end="00:16:53.450" style="s2">people who came through the 90s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.570" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">trying to take over our systems of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.450" end="00:17:00.340" style="s2">knowledge production and it&#39;s hitting up</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:03.950" style="s2">against reality and scientists because</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.340" end="00:17:07.250" style="s2">it&#39;s only true in certain aspects like</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.950" end="00:17:08.930" style="s2">it&#39;s in the promotional kind of this big</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.250" end="00:17:12.350" style="s2">marketing campaign that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.930" end="00:17:14.180" style="s2">creating well they also don&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.350" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">and I think almost nobody appreciates</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.180" end="00:17:21.440" style="s2">how much stuff is functioning that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:23.570" style="s2">depends yet on this other worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.440" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">so if you&#39;re very focused on what</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.570" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work in your world because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:30.980" style="s2">know let&#39;s say you&#39;re black in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:32.690" style="s2">black in the US is a problem does it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.980" end="00:17:35.510" style="s2">mean there are no successful blacks no</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.690" end="00:17:37.490" style="s2">but it is a problem right it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.510" end="00:17:39.650" style="s2">predicament that has a long history</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.490" end="00:17:45.290" style="s2">that nobody alive today had anything to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.650" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">do with building but if you&#39;re focused</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.290" end="00:17:50.780" style="s2">on that problem and your point is well</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:53.450" style="s2">if we swap out the thing that empowered</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.780" end="00:17:58.450" style="s2">those who did this then we&#39;ll be good</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.450" end="00:18:02.090" style="s2">you don&#39;t realize that the electric grid</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.450" end="00:18:04.820" style="s2">nuclear reactors the thing that keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.090" end="00:18:07.220" style="s2">from being attacked by foreign powers</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.820" end="00:18:08.809" style="s2">all of this is actually built on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:10.850" style="s2">scientific framework has that framework</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.809" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">been misused regularly and you should</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.850" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">expect it to continue to be yes used</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:15.920" style="s2">yeah right what we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:18.380" style="s2">minimize the level at which it&#39;s misused</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.920" end="00:18:21.050" style="s2">but you you can&#39;t prevent it but when</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.380" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">somebody like me a scientist says no the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.050" end="00:18:24.200" style="s2">scientific method is about preventing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:27.140" style="s2">bias we&#39;re talking about the method</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.200" end="00:18:29.270" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about those who wear a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.140" end="00:18:31.580" style="s2">lab coat are speaking the truth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.270" end="00:18:35.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s preposterous not scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.580" end="00:18:37.400" style="s2">yeah so anyway see that that conception</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.720" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">of the person the labs that coat</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:42.410" style="s2">speaking the truth and him being full of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:44.059" style="s2">shit that is inside their their way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.410" end="00:18:47.780" style="s2">thinking and so they put on a lab coat</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.059" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">they put the PS their PhD badge on and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.780" end="00:18:52.429" style="s2">then they they speak so confidently like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:53.450" style="s2">they speak so confidently about things</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.429" end="00:18:55.730" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t be confident about</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.450" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">because in their worldview everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.730" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">is speaking like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">and unfortunately the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">establishment has allowed some really</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">low quality stuff to be sanctioned yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:10.100" style="s2">mundane economic reasons that have to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:11.780" style="s2">with the way universities are funded and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.100" end="00:19:13.610" style="s2">all of that but well many ways the life</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.780" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">right like it&#39;s just nothing&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.610" end="00:19:18.050" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have some issues well it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:19.490" style="s2">could attack those issues I think it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:23.480" style="s2">could be a lot better yeah we could have</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.490" end="00:19:26.270" style="s2">yet we could we could declare a border</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.480" end="00:19:27.920" style="s2">between the market and science and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.270" end="00:19:29.750" style="s2">could protect science as the important</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.920" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">thing that it is we should do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.750" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">having not done that there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.270" end="00:19:37.309" style="s2">garbage east up gets dressed up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:39.170" style="s2">scientific clothing and so it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.309" end="00:19:39.800" style="s2">if there&#39;s no point to be made yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.170" end="00:19:41.870" style="s2">no I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.800" end="00:19:43.970" style="s2">if your point is there is no science</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.870" end="00:19:48.169" style="s2">it&#39;s all about powers well</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.970" end="00:19:50.179" style="s2">hang on guys yeah that one that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.169" end="00:19:54.019" style="s2">thing like fucose like they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.179" end="00:19:57.799" style="s2">Jesus but he talks about these stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.019" end="00:19:59.570" style="s2">yeah he says that um that there is such</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.799" end="00:20:01.399" style="s2">things functional power he just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.570" end="00:20:03.529" style="s2">to figure out that the the blueprint of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.399" end="00:20:05.450" style="s2">proud power he I mean he had his own</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.529" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">biases that he definitely put in there</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.450" end="00:20:10.909" style="s2">yeah and he went to fires like this wild</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:14.389" style="s2">man but what they&#39;ve done from late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.909" end="00:20:15.799" style="s2">into the 90s is mind boggling what</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.389" end="00:20:17.539" style="s2">they&#39;ve done with his ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.799" end="00:20:18.710" style="s2">ideas of the other the post modernist</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.539" end="00:20:21.830" style="s2">that were kind of kicking around at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.710" end="00:20:23.509" style="s2">time right and we&#39;re now sealing it you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.830" end="00:20:28.039" style="s2">know even yet we&#39;re living in the sins</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.509" end="00:20:29.570" style="s2">of Michele Foucault well so for some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.039" end="00:20:31.730" style="s2">us I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.570" end="00:20:34.070" style="s2">I will ask just out of courtesy but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.730" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">know for certain that you will be in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.070" end="00:20:37.370" style="s2">same camp yeah you not have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:38.570" style="s2">experience of looking at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.370" end="00:20:40.759" style="s2">stuff that we are now apparently</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.570" end="00:20:43.389" style="s2">fighting about yeah and thinking if</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.759" end="00:20:46.669" style="s2">you&#39;d asked me five years ago whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.389" end="00:20:48.139" style="s2">anybody was going to challenge the truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.669" end="00:20:49.490" style="s2">it yet say the fact that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.139" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">difference between males and females and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.490" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not perfectly arbitrary I I knew</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.340" style="s2">that there was like hints in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.090" end="00:21:01.220" style="s2">direction I dia that we would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.340" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">fighting about whether or not a trans</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.220" end="00:21:05.000" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">yeah and compete against people who are</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.000" end="00:21:10.519" style="s2">born female in athletic competition</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:12.879" style="s2">right I would have said and you think I</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.519" end="00:21:15.860" style="s2">seen it right like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.879" end="00:21:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s disorientating and most people most</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.860" end="00:21:18.919" style="s2">people feel like that like I think the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.450" end="00:21:22.220" style="s2">majority of people like what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.919" end="00:21:24.769" style="s2">going on with it some strange strange</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.220" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">like sleep universe or something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.769" end="00:21:28.090" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:31.490" style="s2">well so it has been operating like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.090" end="00:21:32.740" style="s2">very much from the 90s onwards we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.490" end="00:21:35.629" style="s2">they&#39;ve got thirty years of scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.740" end="00:21:38.509" style="s2">then tumblr comes along and makes it</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.629" end="00:21:40.100" style="s2">super accessible and it&#39;s it&#39;s spread</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.509" end="00:21:44.409" style="s2">like we&#39;re already kind of living in</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.100" end="00:21:47.990" style="s2">there what is it they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.409" end="00:21:51.340" style="s2">moral hegemony if like my whole life has</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.990" end="00:21:55.460" style="s2">been in this in this milieu the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.340" end="00:21:57.350" style="s2">victimhood mentality but it very much</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.460" end="00:22:00.679" style="s2">collided with the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.350" end="00:22:02.600" style="s2">and all of a sudden it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.679" end="00:22:05.510" style="s2">everywhere and it&#39;s in its I would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.600" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">purest form it&#39;s it&#39;s in in the form</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.510" end="00:22:09.230" style="s2">that they light down in this inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:11.150" style="s2">their scholarship well you know it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.230" end="00:22:13.070" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m not convinced that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.150" end="00:22:15.380" style="s2">have a full understanding of why the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.070" end="00:22:21.830" style="s2">internet had the effect on it that it</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.380" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">did but it it allows very fringe ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.830" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">that are held by isolated pockets to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:31.460" style="s2">congeal into a hole that they would</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:36.650" style="s2">otherwise would not and it also it</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.460" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">allows a kind of tactical growth where</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.650" end="00:22:43.669" style="s2">each one of these forays into the absurd</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">learns a bit about what it cannot do</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.669" end="00:22:50.330" style="s2">what arguments are feeble and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">are forceful and so it learns and is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.330" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">spreading in a way that is quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:58.940" style="s2">dangerous yeah you know I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:04.909" style="s2">Darwinian but the it&#39;s it&#39;s selecting</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.940" end="00:23:07.990" style="s2">for emotion and so the these that these</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.909" end="00:23:10.970" style="s2">are so this this scholarship it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.990" end="00:23:14.690" style="s2">navigating around these deep moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:17.030" style="s2">emotions I mean a young would call them</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.690" end="00:23:18.770" style="s2">like an archetypal type thing Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.030" end="00:23:20.929" style="s2">height would call them what are they</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.770" end="00:23:22.909" style="s2">moral foundations they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.929" end="00:23:26.090" style="s2">revolving around it&#39;s very much care</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.909" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">harm in in the Jonathan hight way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.090" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">looking at it so they were revolving</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">around you I said they weren&#39;t policing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:33.950" style="s2">for sight anything scientific it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:35.780" style="s2">more moral intuition yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.950" end="00:23:38.870" style="s2">they&#39;re circling around these moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.780" end="00:23:41.720" style="s2">intuitions and they&#39;ve created like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.870" end="00:23:43.010" style="s2">reams and reams and reams of work I rap</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.720" end="00:23:45.620" style="s2">just circling around these moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.010" end="00:23:47.659" style="s2">intuitions and policing this new</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.620" end="00:23:49.730" style="s2">worldview and so you plug the internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.659" end="00:23:52.549" style="s2">into that and it&#39;s something where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.730" end="00:23:55.340" style="s2">already living in this world where you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.549" end="00:23:57.860" style="s2">know social justice is it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.340" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">our religion really like we it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.860" end="00:24:06.560" style="s2">the most gripping moral system that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:08.150" style="s2">have you know this Christianity yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.560" end="00:24:13.580" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of on the outskirts of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.150" end="00:24:15.710" style="s2">media and haman system and so it just it</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.580" end="00:24:18.410" style="s2">field that those plugs right I feel is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.710" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">moral system that kind of moved across</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.410" end="00:24:22.730" style="s2">the internet because the internet</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:24.800" style="s2">selects for emotion and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.730" end="00:24:26.630" style="s2">things like the shooting videos and my</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.800" end="00:24:29.390" style="s2">first film was it was a it was about a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.630" end="00:24:31.430" style="s2">video I talk about a racist incident on</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.390" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">a bus in Australia and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.430" end="00:24:35.330" style="s2">exploding becoming very viral because</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:36.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s proof its world view of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.330" end="00:24:39.230" style="s2">thing but if you actually look at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.620" end="00:24:40.730" style="s2">stories behind these viral videos it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.230" end="00:24:44.420" style="s2">lot more complicated than that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.730" end="00:24:46.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not this kind of cartoon world that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.420" end="00:24:48.710" style="s2">they&#39;ve created it&#39;s based on this these</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.040" end="00:24:50.090" style="s2">deep moral intuitions so there are a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.710" end="00:24:52.010" style="s2">couple of things I want to explore from</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.090" end="00:24:53.690" style="s2">what you said yeah one of them has to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.010" end="00:24:56.600" style="s2">with the fact that we as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.690" end="00:24:58.250" style="s2">are not prepared for the modern</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.600" end="00:25:00.560" style="s2">environment in a lot of ways but one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.250" end="00:25:03.920" style="s2">them that&#39;s very clear is that our</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.560" end="00:25:06.650" style="s2">ability to see events that are remote</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.920" end="00:25:08.510" style="s2">and the bias in favour of seeing remote</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.650" end="00:25:11.270" style="s2">events that are interesting rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.510" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">ones that are not interesting results in</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.270" end="00:25:18.520" style="s2">a total distortion of our sampling of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:23.180" style="s2">the world and so I remember as a kid</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.520" end="00:25:25.070" style="s2">plane crashes were a regular topic of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:26.900" style="s2">conversation why because every time a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.070" end="00:25:29.510" style="s2">plane crashes and ends up on the news</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.900" end="00:25:32.510" style="s2">its grisly there are bodies being picked</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.510" end="00:25:34.250" style="s2">part by part it&#39;s hard to look away yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.510" end="00:25:36.950" style="s2">and that because it spends a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.250" end="00:25:38.030" style="s2">on your TV yeah you get the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.950" end="00:25:40.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a common thing whereas</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.030" end="00:25:42.050" style="s2">statistically speaking you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.010" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">safer than when you&#39;re on a plane you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:45.590" style="s2">know even in the worst year you never</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.970" end="00:25:46.940" style="s2">say for them when you&#39;re on a plane most</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.590" end="00:25:48.110" style="s2">dangerous thing to you on a plane is if</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.940" end="00:25:49.490" style="s2">you have a heart attack there or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.110" end="00:25:51.650" style="s2">stroke and you can&#39;t get to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.490" end="00:25:52.790" style="s2">fast enough but frankly anytime that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.650" end="00:25:54.200" style="s2">you&#39;re in that plane you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.790" end="00:25:55.970" style="s2">protected from all the things that could</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.200" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">happen to you on the ground yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.970" end="00:26:01.250" style="s2">and so we get a very warped view based</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:05.480" style="s2">on what&#39;s on the screen the same is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.250" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">milk on kids that went missing so sudden</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.480" end="00:26:10.700" style="s2">there&#39;s all this Asteria around child</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">abduction totally which changed the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.700" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">we raise children in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:17.500" style="s2">incoherent way</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:20.110" style="s2">huge sociological events based on the I</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:22.210" style="s2">guess it&#39;s technology like we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.110" end="00:26:24.029" style="s2">lighting against this technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.210" end="00:26:25.990" style="s2">amount of time that people spend</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.029" end="00:26:28.899" style="s2">interacting with a screen like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.990" end="00:26:31.179" style="s2">their world yet most people so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.899" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">lot of people leaving their screen and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.179" end="00:26:35.740" style="s2">not really even interacting with with</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">reality that they live in they actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.740" end="00:26:39.509" style="s2">understand the world through this strong</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.590" style="s2">I bet that will be reflected</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.509" end="00:26:43.720" style="s2">neurologically I know we&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.590" end="00:26:46.139" style="s2">questioning with one fan so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.720" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">it&#39;s very much I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.139" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">fundamentally technological it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.700" end="00:26:53.139" style="s2">fundamentally technological but my guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">is we will start to see reflected in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.139" end="00:26:58.149" style="s2">neurobiology of people yet this device</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">that because so much of your reward</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.149" end="00:27:02.860" style="s2">structure is tied in through events that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:05.860" style="s2">happen over the device that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.860" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">begin to see through it yeah and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.860" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">that does mean is that you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:14.019" style="s2">and I would consider normal interaction</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:16.690" style="s2">is you know at best a second kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.019" end="00:27:19.809" style="s2">normal interaction rather than the real</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.690" end="00:27:21.370" style="s2">deal and even I feel this myself I spend</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.809" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">way too much time on you too and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.370" end="00:27:26.289" style="s2">trying to spend less but I&#39;m only just</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">getting used to doing this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.289" end="00:27:30.460" style="s2">and then when you invited me I was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:32.259" style="s2">oh maybe I can squeeze out and we can do</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.460" end="00:27:33.279" style="s2">it by Scott because I just felt like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.259" end="00:27:36.820" style="s2">would be more comfortable in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.279" end="00:27:39.490" style="s2">situation and I guess this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.820" end="00:27:41.559" style="s2">more and more like yeah it is it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.490" end="00:27:42.759" style="s2">I&#39;m comfortable I kind of in my room and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.559" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">then I can I can look at everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.759" end="00:27:47.409" style="s2">through a screen and be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">more disconnected from it well you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.409" end="00:27:54.519" style="s2">on the one hand I have kind of a mixed</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:56.620" style="s2">reaction to video calls one way in which</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.519" end="00:27:58.330" style="s2">video calls are just not as productive</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.620" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">as they should be yeah there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.330" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">way in which they are better there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:07.149" style="s2">some fraction of like facial expressions</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:09.700" style="s2">and things that are conveyed well enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.149" end="00:28:11.409" style="s2">through a video call yeah it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.700" end="00:28:14.289" style="s2">good as sitting with somebody but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.409" end="00:28:16.929" style="s2">better than just listening to them but</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.289" end="00:28:17.889" style="s2">there is something missing and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.929" end="00:28:19.870" style="s2">know what it is I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.889" end="00:28:22.659" style="s2">channel it travels on but frankly my</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.870" end="00:28:24.820" style="s2">enthusiasm for having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.659" end="00:28:26.169" style="s2">with somebody like you goes way up if</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.820" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be sitting in the same room</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.169" end="00:28:29.750" style="s2">because much of what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.190" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.750" end="00:28:35.070" style="s2">you know that the right analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.190" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">really a corrective lens right the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.070" end="00:28:39.090" style="s2">corrective lens is for somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:41.340" style="s2">an eye that is seeing in a distorted</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.090" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">fashion you take a distortion to correct</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.340" end="00:28:44.940" style="s2">for the distortion that you&#39;ve got on</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.980" style="s2">board we all have a distortion that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.940" end="00:28:48.870" style="s2">comes from the increasing role that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.980" end="00:28:50.550" style="s2">screens are playing in our perception of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.870" end="00:28:53.010" style="s2">what&#39;s actually taking place and why</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.550" end="00:28:55.190" style="s2">and there&#39;s another correction that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.010" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">comes from you and I sitting in person</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.190" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not natural we&#39;ve got yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:03.300" style="s2">devices here we are Todd&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:05.040" style="s2">people asynchronously out there who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.300" end="00:29:06.179" style="s2">not talking back but we imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.040" end="00:29:08.070" style="s2">they might think about what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.179" end="00:29:09.809" style="s2">yeah very unnatural yeah on the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.070" end="00:29:11.250" style="s2">hand the very fact that some part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.809" end="00:29:12.690" style="s2">this is natural that you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.250" end="00:29:14.670" style="s2">sitting in a physical room having the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.690" end="00:29:16.679" style="s2">conversation yeah corrects for part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.670" end="00:29:19.290" style="s2">it and there&#39;s but even my feeling of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.679" end="00:29:21.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of inputs here that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.290" end="00:29:23.100" style="s2">making me a little more anxious than if</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.240" end="00:29:25.800" style="s2">they were through a screen I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.100" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">that like so I spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.800" end="00:29:31.380" style="s2">studying this stuff and and just editing</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">over the past year and I was going</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.380" end="00:29:36.860" style="s2">outside less and less and less and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:38.670" style="s2">it&#39;s like early on scent early onset</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.860" end="00:29:39.990" style="s2">agoraphobia or something like that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.670" end="00:29:42.179" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what happened but when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.990" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">went outside everything was louder and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.179" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">it was it was hard to talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:50.160" style="s2">like I and I&#39;ve never been my</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:51.780" style="s2">extroverted I grow like who is</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.160" end="00:29:53.130" style="s2">extroverted guy and now all the sudden</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.780" end="00:29:54.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.130" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">and I know it&#39;s this green it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.210" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">something something to do with too much</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:29:58.890" style="s2">time in the screen too much time by</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.510" end="00:30:01.860" style="s2">yourself too much time in your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.890" end="00:30:03.809" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting that make you feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.860" end="00:30:05.130" style="s2">different and I&#39;m an artist so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.809" end="00:30:06.900" style="s2">sensitive to those sort of things and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.130" end="00:30:08.610" style="s2">think that this is happening I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.900" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">it in other people I&#39;m seeing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.610" end="00:30:12.540" style="s2">lot of people they were trading from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:14.790" style="s2">world and they&#39;re interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.540" end="00:30:17.850" style="s2">world virus screen and that that is some</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.790" end="00:30:20.130" style="s2">kind of so am I wrong so I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.850" end="00:30:23.100" style="s2">having this experience I I&#39;m actually I</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.130" end="00:30:25.620" style="s2">tend to be kind of introverted and my</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.100" end="00:30:29.040" style="s2">life in the last it&#39;s not even since</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.620" end="00:30:31.950" style="s2">evergreen from before that has forced me</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.040" end="00:30:34.860" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of a secondary extrovert where</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.950" end="00:30:37.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to get used to it and I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.860" end="00:30:40.380" style="s2">now but true it was unnatural to me at</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.740" end="00:30:44.520" style="s2">first so I&#39;m in motion on the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.380" end="00:30:46.830" style="s2">yeah but I&#39;m imagining based on what</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.520" end="00:30:50.220" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that there&#39;s a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.830" end="00:30:53.309" style="s2">like nakedness yeah when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.220" end="00:30:55.169" style="s2">person yeah that is like you know behind</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.309" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">the screen it&#39;s like properly clothed</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.169" end="00:31:01.710" style="s2">you&#39;re not revealing anything which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:04.580" style="s2">really I mean I don&#39;t want to overreact</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.710" end="00:31:08.600" style="s2">to it it&#39;s a little bit tragic that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.580" end="00:31:11.700" style="s2">people human beings are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.600" end="00:31:13.169" style="s2">jeopardized by the presence of other</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.700" end="00:31:14.760" style="s2">human beings in their physical space</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.169" end="00:31:17.460" style="s2">like oh no particularly Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.760" end="00:31:20.940" style="s2">right I&#39;m a millennial and even the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.460" end="00:31:23.820" style="s2">generation under it&#39;s it is strange</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.940" end="00:31:25.470" style="s2">they were there&#39;s this thing as this</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.820" end="00:31:27.270" style="s2">thing going around like you can memes</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.470" end="00:31:28.620" style="s2">are really good the memes that go out</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.270" end="00:31:30.120" style="s2">they kind of give you an insight into</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.620" end="00:31:32.970" style="s2">how the generation is feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.120" end="00:31:34.980" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s a several like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.970" end="00:31:36.659" style="s2">kind of classic memes about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.980" end="00:31:39.990" style="s2">intrusion of a phone call</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.659" end="00:31:42.539" style="s2">yeah and the phone call is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.990" end="00:31:45.630" style="s2">intrusion it&#39;s like no no text me don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.539" end="00:31:48.450" style="s2">write on me and it&#39;s it&#39;s it really is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.630" end="00:31:49.950" style="s2">an insight into where all our brains are</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.450" end="00:31:53.159" style="s2">Bank brains are out so something</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.950" end="00:31:54.330" style="s2">physiological happening because of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.159" end="00:31:56.520" style="s2">technology we&#39;re surrounding ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.330" end="00:31:59.220" style="s2">with so I wonder now that you mention it</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.520" end="00:32:08.400" style="s2">so I am NOT a millennial I&#39;m a Gen X</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.220" end="00:32:09.390" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not a boomer so no I like</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.400" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.390" end="00:32:15.720" style="s2">so when I grew up in you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:17.520" style="s2">earliest memories a phone was an object</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.720" end="00:32:20.909" style="s2">that was plugged into the wall and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.520" end="00:32:22.679" style="s2">cordless phone was kind of a thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.909" end="00:32:24.900" style="s2">you know it was I remember that being</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.679" end="00:32:29.429" style="s2">like most phones were actually just</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.900" end="00:32:30.929" style="s2">physically plugged in and then I</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.429" end="00:32:33.240" style="s2">remember cell phones I didn&#39;t get one</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.929" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2">for the longest time I didn&#39;t occur to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.240" end="00:32:37.350" style="s2">me that I needed one and then suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">they became ubiquitous and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.350" end="00:32:43.890" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re just handicapped not to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">it but I wonder if the key reason that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.890" end="00:32:49.049" style="s2">people who are young you know millennial</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.159" end="00:32:51.179" style="s2">and younger might be having some of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.049" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">experience you&#39;re describing is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.179" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">asynchronous communication allows</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">a lot of room for posturing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:04.490" style="s2">figuring out how something is going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">land and delivering it in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.490" end="00:33:08.180" style="s2">feel like yep that one&#39;s ready for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:09.290" style="s2">world we&#39;ve become an actor right actors</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.180" end="00:33:11.720" style="s2">are cool because their lines are written</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.290" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">for them that if you if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.720" end="00:33:14.990" style="s2">time to script your your communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:17.960" style="s2">and all of a sudden you&#39;re cool and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.990" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">would be you know right so this actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">dovetails with something I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:27.770" style="s2">Jordan Peterson say it I&#39;ve heard me say</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:31.580" style="s2">it I&#39;ve heard Ben Shapiro said that at</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.770" end="00:33:34.610" style="s2">the point that you find yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.580" end="00:33:36.050" style="s2">situations like this where something is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.610" end="00:33:37.880" style="s2">going to go into the world and it will</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.050" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">have some impact and you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.880" end="00:33:43.970" style="s2">live with the aftermath of it you you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.260" end="00:33:46.070" style="s2">into this mode where you are speaking</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.970" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">and then some part of you is watching</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:53.870" style="s2">what you&#39;re about to say and checking</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">everything and I wonder if that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.870" end="00:33:57.830" style="s2">bit lacking if your experience was that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:00.200" style="s2">a lot of communication is asynchronous</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.830" end="00:34:02.390" style="s2">yeah if that&#39;s how you grew up then I</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.200" end="00:34:04.520" style="s2">wonder if that&#39;s harder you know I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.390" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">do it in real time it&#39;s taxing yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.520" end="00:34:09.889" style="s2">it&#39;s possible yeah but if my experience</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:11.389" style="s2">was that your average communication even</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.889" end="00:34:14.419" style="s2">interpersonal communication was</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.389" end="00:34:17.360" style="s2">asynchronous then maybe that circuit</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.419" end="00:34:21.050" style="s2">just isn&#39;t very strong yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.360" end="00:34:22.610" style="s2">also you you I mean part of the being so</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.050" end="00:34:23.720" style="s2">judgmental about everything everyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.610" end="00:34:26.389" style="s2">says it&#39;s because they&#39;ve had time to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.720" end="00:34:27.830" style="s2">think about it like people used to shoot</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.389" end="00:34:29.060" style="s2">off the hip and say whatever they want</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.830" end="00:34:31.429" style="s2">and it was okay who&#39;s okay to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.060" end="00:34:33.860" style="s2">mistakes you know I wonder if this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.429" end="00:34:35.240" style="s2">not actually playing a huge role here I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.860" end="00:34:39.409" style="s2">mean maybe this is exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.240" end="00:34:41.840" style="s2">saying but i watch people get canceled</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.409" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">for something that I agree they</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.840" end="00:34:47.960" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have said Yeah right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:51.050" style="s2">like wait that was fatal yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.960" end="00:34:53.929" style="s2">and it&#39;s like whoa that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.050" end="00:34:57.230" style="s2">about taking somebody&#39;s well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.929" end="00:34:59.930" style="s2">zeroing it out over something that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.230" end="00:35:02.030" style="s2">said sometimes it&#39;s not even what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.930" end="00:35:03.890" style="s2">meant they just trying something out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.030" end="00:35:06.080" style="s2">you know when I was teaching we had</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.890" end="00:35:07.640" style="s2">these things called covenants students</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.080" end="00:35:09.230" style="s2">and professors would</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.640" end="00:35:11.210" style="s2">agree at the beginning of a course what</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.230" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">the rules were right and those could be</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.210" end="00:35:16.340" style="s2">rules about grading how you you know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.020" end="00:35:18.050" style="s2">something isn&#39;t to your liking what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.340" end="00:35:20.990" style="s2">do about it and all that but I used to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.050" end="00:35:24.520" style="s2">include in that that everybody has the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.990" end="00:35:26.870" style="s2">right to take back what they&#39;ve said and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.520" end="00:35:27.320" style="s2">restate it you can say that wasn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.870" end="00:35:29.060" style="s2">I meant</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.320" end="00:35:31.820" style="s2">or it was what I meant but I no longer</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.060" end="00:35:33.860" style="s2">think that everybody has that right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.820" end="00:35:34.910" style="s2">you should speak knowing that you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.860" end="00:35:36.380" style="s2">that right and you should treat</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.910" end="00:35:39.230" style="s2">everybody else and then say have it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.380" end="00:35:42.770" style="s2">being human right it&#39;s normal yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.230" end="00:35:43.940" style="s2">so maybe maybe your point is just all</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.770" end="00:35:45.620" style="s2">right let&#39;s put it this way I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.940" end="00:35:48.230" style="s2">heard this anywhere else but I do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.620" end="00:35:49.940" style="s2">does immediately strike me as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.230" end="00:35:51.770" style="s2">important component here is that people</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.940" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">are being held responsible at a new</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.770" end="00:35:56.480" style="s2">level because asynchronous communication</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:35:58.280" style="s2">allows people to pretty stuff up more</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.480" end="00:36:00.470" style="s2">than as normal yeah and so people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.280" end="00:36:02.450" style="s2">used to the noise of people saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.470" end="00:36:04.610" style="s2">something a bit tone-deaf and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.450" end="00:36:07.970" style="s2">know the the policing is a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.610" end="00:36:11.540" style="s2">thing as well like there&#39;s another input</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.970" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">here which is so in the in our legal</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.540" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">just assessment system you you often</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:20.180" style="s2">punish people as a to show everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:22.790" style="s2">that that shouldn&#39;t be done yep I send a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.180" end="00:36:26.570" style="s2">message I guess deterrence yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.790" end="00:36:28.370" style="s2">within this this scripture</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.570" end="00:36:32.690" style="s2">let&#39;s call let&#39;s call it there the Canon</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.370" end="00:36:34.220" style="s2">it&#39;s racism is perpetuated through</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.690" end="00:36:36.890" style="s2">discourses so the way we think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.220" end="00:36:39.650" style="s2">things so someone puts their foot wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.890" end="00:36:41.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually the human that&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.650" end="00:36:43.220" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange thing where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.690" end="00:36:44.930" style="s2">individual responsibility they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.220" end="00:36:46.670" style="s2">really consider it very much yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.930" end="00:36:48.920" style="s2">not the human it&#39;s the discourses</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.670" end="00:36:50.990" style="s2">working through the human so if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.920" end="00:36:54.110" style="s2">converge on it and get rid of it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.990" end="00:36:57.350" style="s2">actually you&#39;re you&#39;re actually going</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.110" end="00:36:58.940" style="s2">after the evil that&#39;s in the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.350" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">you&#39;re not going after the human you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.940" end="00:37:02.030" style="s2">going after the eagle because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.110" end="00:37:03.620" style="s2">discourses are working through them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.030" end="00:37:05.930" style="s2">so when you start actually learning</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.620" end="00:37:07.910" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here yeah see it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.930" end="00:37:09.380" style="s2">it&#39;s so intuitive yeah and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.910" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">how something like that would spread as</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.380" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">a new met is a metaphysical system</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:17.150" style="s2">that&#39;s spreading over everything and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:19.100" style="s2">mean the technology is creating the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.150" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">atmosphere in which this can take place</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.100" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">and as we were talking about we could</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:27.940" style="s2">talk all day about what the different</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:31.210" style="s2">inputs that are making this a huge</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.940" end="00:37:33.369" style="s2">cultural phenomenon but underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.210" end="00:37:35.619" style="s2">the scripture description they&#39;ve laid</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.369" end="00:37:37.410" style="s2">all this out it&#39;s all there and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.619" end="00:37:39.940" style="s2">they talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.410" end="00:37:42.309" style="s2">unapologetically when you when you go</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.940" end="00:37:45.369" style="s2">behind the closed doors of the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.309" end="00:37:46.779" style="s2">yes okay I&#39;ve got two places I want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.369" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">go I wanna make sure we don&#39;t lose them</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.779" end="00:37:50.259" style="s2">I think they&#39;re both important so if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:53.579" style="s2">forget remind me that I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.259" end="00:37:56.140" style="s2">about Yale okay okay what happened there</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.579" end="00:37:58.059" style="s2">but first let&#39;s talk about the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.140" end="00:38:01.299" style="s2">about these moral intuitions and I like</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.059" end="00:38:04.059" style="s2">how you phrase it resonates for me so</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.299" end="00:38:06.789" style="s2">there&#39;s this moral intuition and some of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.059" end="00:38:09.130" style="s2">these moral intuitions I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.789" end="00:38:11.859" style="s2">not right as they&#39;re stated but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.130" end="00:38:13.930" style="s2">could fix them right there the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.859" end="00:38:15.880" style="s2">is correct it&#39;s just the phrasing is way</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.930" end="00:38:18.549" style="s2">to hell off yeah but we&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.880" end="00:38:20.319" style="s2">phrasing like action so the old moral</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.549" end="00:38:22.180" style="s2">intuitions are intuitions but they</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.319" end="00:38:28.390" style="s2">unless you&#39;re lining them up with some</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.180" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">kind of empirical you know method to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.390" end="00:38:31.450" style="s2">what you want based on those intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:33.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s what are they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.450" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">discharging feelings well let me let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.700" end="00:38:39.219" style="s2">take an example so this is more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:42.940" style="s2">okay let&#39;s take the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.219" end="00:38:45.640" style="s2">difference in performance that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.940" end="00:38:49.229" style="s2">economic performance of people from</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.640" end="00:38:53.319" style="s2">different racial groups is the result of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.229" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">bias and unfairness mm-hmm I actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.319" end="00:38:58.269" style="s2">suspect that that&#39;s probably almost</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:39:00.099" style="s2">correct I think there&#39;s a lot all of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.269" end="00:39:02.140" style="s2">down to that but you couldn&#39;t put that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.099" end="00:39:05.469" style="s2">at its blanket rule but you can&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.140" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">can&#39;t assume it yeah but my guess would</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.469" end="00:39:09.190" style="s2">be based on everything I&#39;ve seen yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.599" end="00:39:11.650" style="s2">and everything I&#39;ve seen includes an</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.190" end="00:39:13.059" style="s2">awful lot of time tromping around in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.650" end="00:39:15.160" style="s2">other people&#39;s minds when they were my</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.059" end="00:39:17.079" style="s2">student yeah you know I looked into</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.160" end="00:39:19.329" style="s2">their minds in order to help them learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.079" end="00:39:21.910" style="s2">yeah I in the process learned an awful</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.329" end="00:39:23.469" style="s2">lot about them yeah yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.910" end="00:39:26.950" style="s2">open to that I actually think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.469" end="00:39:29.140" style="s2">probably the case yeah so I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.950" end="00:39:31.539" style="s2">did just thought experiment level yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.140" end="00:39:33.369" style="s2">if you fixed the unfairness so that all</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.539" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">of the little threads that have carried</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.369" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">through one Jenner</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:39.190" style="s2">to the next were actually just</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:42.130" style="s2">neutralized and you started us all you</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.190" end="00:39:44.050" style="s2">know in the same position with the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.130" end="00:39:47.020" style="s2">advantage is the same access to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.050" end="00:39:49.330" style="s2">education and all I believe that almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.020" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">all of this would disappear and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.330" end="00:39:54.970" style="s2">what you would find is that in general</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:58.359" style="s2">people are very similar in their</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.970" end="00:40:01.720" style="s2">capacity they&#39;re very similar in their</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.359" end="00:40:04.060" style="s2">built-in desires and that basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.720" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2">these massive differences that we find</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.060" end="00:40:09.130" style="s2">in preference for activities and things</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.700" end="00:40:10.900" style="s2">is all you know some of its arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.130" end="00:40:12.580" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s based on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.900" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve traveled different paths and had</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.580" end="00:40:19.720" style="s2">different opportunities and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">the problem is you cannot project that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.720" end="00:40:23.530" style="s2">onto the system as I say it&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:25.660" style="s2">take it as an assumption yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.530" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">there could be differences yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.660" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">might matter my intuition is that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:31.600" style="s2">don&#39;t matter very much</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">big ones might exist between males and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.600" end="00:40:35.830" style="s2">females there&#39;s a very good biological</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.960" style="s2">reason to expect differences there to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.830" end="00:40:39.250" style="s2">make them will fit for other things you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.960" end="00:40:41.230" style="s2">know what I mean like it&#39;s not right as</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.250" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">know it seems like a power imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.230" end="00:40:45.700" style="s2">because of the culture but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:47.140" style="s2">women are gonna be on average better at</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.700" end="00:40:48.609" style="s2">certain things and men are gonna be on</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.140" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">average better at other things and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.609" end="00:40:54.430" style="s2">that&#39;s can&#39;t be the case that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:56.140" style="s2">the nature between males and females and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.430" end="00:40:58.660" style="s2">that&#39;s awesome we like why not encourage</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.140" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">that and and and right I to that rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.660" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">than play against it well frankly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:05.950" style="s2">I&#39;m very up for a world in which we</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:08.440" style="s2">absolutely free people to jumped out</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.950" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">yeah yeah and decide you know what I may</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.440" end="00:41:14.200" style="s2">be female but I like the stuff that men</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:15.550" style="s2">are more typically into and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.200" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">do that you know Heather is this way</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.550" end="00:41:20.109" style="s2">yeah Heather&#39;s very mask oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:22.150" style="s2">the world and I think that&#39;s great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.109" end="00:41:24.580" style="s2">and I you know but when you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.150" end="00:41:26.740" style="s2">at it on like I mean one to one you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.580" end="00:41:27.970" style="s2">should be looking at it in their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.740" end="00:41:30.970" style="s2">way but I mean if you&#39;re looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.970" end="00:41:34.119" style="s2">from a sociological two hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.970" end="00:41:36.100" style="s2">feet off and you have to think in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.119" end="00:41:37.420" style="s2">numbers right you have to think in bell</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.100" end="00:41:38.590" style="s2">curves yeah because if you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.420" end="00:41:40.119" style="s2">in bell curves and you&#39;re gonna hurt</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.590" end="00:41:41.260" style="s2">people unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.119" end="00:41:43.840" style="s2">you gotta you&#39;re to play to the bell</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.260" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">curves well that&#39;s that&#39;s the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.840" end="00:41:47.079" style="s2">irony I&#39;m getting at it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:48.970" style="s2">at the difference between the moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.079" end="00:41:50.579" style="s2">intuition yeah and the thing that might</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.970" end="00:41:52.630" style="s2">be rescued if you studied it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.579" end="00:41:54.760" style="s2">the thing that you might find that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.630" end="00:41:56.740" style="s2">actually is the reason for the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.760" end="00:41:58.990" style="s2">the extent of the intuition is there for</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.740" end="00:42:01.660" style="s2">organic reasons yeah it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.990" end="00:42:03.730" style="s2">something if I&#39;m right that if you did</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.660" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">neutralize advantages that people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.730" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">basically the same and responding to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:10.770" style="s2">different opportunities based on you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.230" end="00:42:13.960" style="s2">know their particular place in the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.770" end="00:42:16.599" style="s2">then you could say something that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.960" end="00:42:19.089" style="s2">there&#39;s an X Factor mmm right the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.599" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">that make different populations function</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.089" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">differently has to do with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.980" style="s2">arbitrary things that are not inherent</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.790" end="00:42:28.450" style="s2">the creature I want to click clear</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.980" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">something up here a little bit so my</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.450" end="00:42:35.560" style="s2">when I say moral intuition I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:38.140" style="s2">deeper than so at some point there is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.560" end="00:42:38.920" style="s2">there&#39;s the what I find is very</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.140" end="00:42:41.770" style="s2">difficult to explain</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.920" end="00:42:45.030" style="s2">there is the intuition that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.770" end="00:42:48.119" style="s2">emotional feeling right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.030" end="00:42:52.450" style="s2">was often thought if they had some</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.119" end="00:42:55.150" style="s2">symbolism it would be like Mary Mary</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.450" end="00:42:56.440" style="s2">Mother of Christ with the baby and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.150" end="00:42:58.690" style="s2">there&#39;s another symbol of the bear</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.440" end="00:43:00.849" style="s2">protecting its its young all right this</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.690" end="00:43:02.380" style="s2">is fucking mode it&#39;s a mode that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.849" end="00:43:03.550" style="s2">click into and you get really feel it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.380" end="00:43:08.170" style="s2">and it&#39;s in the guts and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.550" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">evolution part of it so culturally so</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.170" end="00:43:11.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the hardware that&#39;s that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:13.060" style="s2">hardware we&#39;re working with as humans</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.380" end="00:43:15.130" style="s2">it&#39;s Universal and it travels through</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.060" end="00:43:17.260" style="s2">time and that&#39;s that I love looking if</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.130" end="00:43:19.270" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to find trying to triangulate</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.260" end="00:43:20.770" style="s2">what these deep emotional feelings are</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.270" end="00:43:22.540" style="s2">by looking at stories through our time</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.770" end="00:43:23.490" style="s2">and you know the religious stories and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.540" end="00:43:26.859" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.490" end="00:43:29.859" style="s2">culturally we put a software on top of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.859" end="00:43:31.720" style="s2">that and that is a home for those moral</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.859" end="00:43:33.630" style="s2">intuitions but underneath those moral</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.720" end="00:43:35.650" style="s2">intuitions they&#39;re just they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.630" end="00:43:38.710" style="s2">driving is in an in a certain direction</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.650" end="00:43:40.660" style="s2">getting us to make certain certain</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.710" end="00:43:42.760" style="s2">decisions it&#39;s ism it&#39;s a movement thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.660" end="00:43:44.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like the energy that&#39;s moving a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.760" end="00:43:46.839" style="s2">culture when you&#39;ve got a moral system</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.950" end="00:43:48.609" style="s2">on top of a culture but even just one</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.839" end="00:43:49.700" style="s2">human he makes his decisions based on</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.609" end="00:43:53.180" style="s2">his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.700" end="00:43:55.220" style="s2">moral moral intuitions that the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.180" end="00:43:56.839" style="s2">hardware that we&#39;re stuck with so when</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.220" end="00:43:59.720" style="s2">you said that the moral tuition is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.839" end="00:44:02.030" style="s2">moving is something I do I do think</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.720" end="00:44:03.559" style="s2">you&#39;re right it&#39;s the it&#39;s the software</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.030" end="00:44:07.190" style="s2">you&#39;re more talking about the software</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.559" end="00:44:12.049" style="s2">on top of it so they&#39;re they&#39;re canon is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.190" end="00:44:13.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s creating it&#39;s it&#39;s creating a</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.960" end="00:44:18.230" style="s2">primarily focused on this care harm one</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.030" end="00:44:26.780" style="s2">totally agree like it&#39;s gone at these</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">intuitions their intuitions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.780" end="00:44:30.380" style="s2">gonna pull us in the right and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.010" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">direction and and a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.380" end="00:44:36.290" style="s2">buying into buying into the stories</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:38.869" style="s2">based on the intuitions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.290" end="00:44:41.420" style="s2">being sold into it on quite logical</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.869" end="00:44:43.339" style="s2">things at the same right but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.420" end="00:44:44.930" style="s2">gets darker and crazier and weirder and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.339" end="00:44:46.130" style="s2">where the further you go into what</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.930" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">they&#39;re actually trying to sell to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.130" end="00:44:50.180" style="s2">world does that make sense I&#39;m very I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:52.280" style="s2">not articulate about these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.180" end="00:44:53.869" style="s2">sometimes no I think he was articulate</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.280" end="00:44:57.020" style="s2">but I have to tell you this is a place</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.869" end="00:44:59.510" style="s2">where I think our what we biologists</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.020" end="00:45:01.940" style="s2">teach yeah as to where the border is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:04.849" style="s2">between biology and other things is so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.940" end="00:45:06.440" style="s2">broken that we can&#39;t help but trip over</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.849" end="00:45:07.819" style="s2">this at this place so let me just tell</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.440" end="00:45:08.930" style="s2">you what I think I&#39;m gonna give you a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.819" end="00:45:10.970" style="s2">preview of what I think we will</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.930" end="00:45:15.530" style="s2">understand about humans 100 years for</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.970" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">still around the software layer the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.530" end="00:45:19.099" style="s2">software layer is composed of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">of things it&#39;s composed of what I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.099" end="00:45:23.390" style="s2">call culture that is things that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">passed down and it is composed of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.390" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">that are learned in real time right they</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:30.559" style="s2">may not be durable hmm</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.510" style="s2">your software layer is composed of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.559" end="00:45:34.849" style="s2">two things but they are just as much</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.510" end="00:45:38.630" style="s2">biological as that which your genes</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.849" end="00:45:40.250" style="s2">set in motion directly and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.630" end="00:45:43.220" style="s2">something going on where these moral</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.250" end="00:45:44.510" style="s2">intuitions are being searched for a</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.220" end="00:45:46.670" style="s2">couple of things one they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.510" end="00:45:50.059" style="s2">searched for content and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.670" end="00:45:52.670" style="s2">being explored in terms of their utility</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.059" end="00:45:54.680" style="s2">and utility is relative to something</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.670" end="00:45:59.240" style="s2">else that I think we teach very very</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.680" end="00:46:00.859" style="s2">badly which is human beings are in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.240" end="00:46:03.230" style="s2">ways just like every other creature but</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.859" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">in some special ways we do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.230" end="00:46:09.230" style="s2">uniquely we are built for a lineage</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:12.290" style="s2">against lineage competition the moral</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.230" end="00:46:14.869" style="s2">intuitions are partially an exploration</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.290" end="00:46:17.930" style="s2">of what might be true and they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.869" end="00:46:19.700" style="s2">partially a claim that doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:21.740" style="s2">it&#39;s true if the question is is this</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.700" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">useful as this advance my lineage is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.740" end="00:46:25.430" style="s2">interest to say it out loud</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:28.579" style="s2">and so this is very confusing because</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.430" end="00:46:30.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a factual claim right the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.579" end="00:46:33.020" style="s2">there are not equal numbers of men and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.470" end="00:46:33.650" style="s2">women in the ranks of programmers at</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.020" end="00:46:36.650" style="s2">Google</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.650" end="00:46:38.680" style="s2">and that that necessarily implies that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.650" end="00:46:41.990" style="s2">there is some sort of discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.680" end="00:46:44.780" style="s2">taking place that&#39;s a claim it&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.990" end="00:46:46.730" style="s2">claim is there discrimination I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.780" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">know but the idea that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.730" end="00:46:49.940" style="s2">there because there&#39;s a difference in</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:52.490" style="s2">the numbers that&#39;s a false claim we know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.940" end="00:46:54.589" style="s2">that but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.490" end="00:46:56.950" style="s2">effective claim and so anyway we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.589" end="00:47:02.359" style="s2">seeing mixture of this sort of empirical</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.950" end="00:47:03.829" style="s2">claim and the strategic claim that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.359" end="00:47:06.109" style="s2">indistinguishable from each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.829" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s makes it very confusing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.109" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">confront it because you don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:13.010" style="s2">to take it apart yeah but one thing if</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">we can just finish out the thread about</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.010" end="00:47:17.329" style="s2">the moral intuitions and whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">they actually line up with something</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.329" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">that would be real if we studied it</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2">the thing that I find so frightening is</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:31.700" style="s2">that the way in which biases of the past</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:35.030" style="s2">or arbitrary differences in starting</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.700" end="00:47:39.740" style="s2">point have altered the fate of modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.030" end="00:47:42.349" style="s2">people are so complex that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.740" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">just come at them painting with a broad</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.349" end="00:47:48.109" style="s2">brush right lots of this stuff may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:50.390" style="s2">unfair and have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.109" end="00:47:52.550" style="s2">discrimination right Guns Germs and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.390" end="00:47:54.290" style="s2">Steel a great example the whole book is</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.550" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">about kinds of unfairness that have</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.290" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">nothing to do with discrimination yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.300" style="s2">they may result in discrimination but</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:01.310" style="s2">they don&#39;t start there they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.300" end="00:48:04.040" style="s2">you know did you have goats in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.310" end="00:48:06.560" style="s2">environment or didn&#39;t you yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.040" end="00:48:08.030" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a very difficult topic and</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.560" end="00:48:09.560" style="s2">the moral intuition might lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.030" end="00:48:11.480" style="s2">study it but what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.560" end="00:48:14.180" style="s2">sabotaging the means by which you would</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.480" end="00:48:16.020" style="s2">study it and figure out you know is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.180" end="00:48:18.600" style="s2">there a basis to the claim yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.020" end="00:48:20.610" style="s2">we can read the degree of unfairness in</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:23.910" style="s2">the difference in outcomes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.610" end="00:48:26.460" style="s2">why I&#39;m calling a theology yes because</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.910" end="00:48:27.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a faith because they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.460" end="00:48:29.880" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling it out that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.690" end="00:48:31.950" style="s2">they&#39;ve moved so far away into this into</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.880" end="00:48:37.140" style="s2">this strange kids are calling a clown</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.950" end="00:48:40.170" style="s2">world now because usually these moral</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.140" end="00:48:41.670" style="s2">intuitions are grounded by inside the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.170" end="00:48:46.650" style="s2">Academy should be grounded by some</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.670" end="00:48:49.740" style="s2">empirical evidence or general Riga you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.650" end="00:48:51.420" style="s2">know yeah or at least advancing the they</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.740" end="00:48:53.160" style="s2">could be advancing the Western Canon but</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.420" end="00:48:54.270" style="s2">they&#39;ve decided to create their own kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.160" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">and shake the etch-a-sketch on</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.270" end="00:48:57.540" style="s2">everything we&#39;ve learnt beforehand if</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:01.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually raised by those yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.540" end="00:49:05.310" style="s2">they hit reset and then they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.140" end="00:49:08.460" style="s2">started from the late 80s and started</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.310" end="00:49:10.470" style="s2">again and but it&#39;s not scientific now</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.460" end="00:49:12.450" style="s2">they&#39;ve diverged into this strange area</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.470" end="00:49:13.980" style="s2">of theology and it&#39;s so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.450" end="00:49:17.010" style="s2">startup religion it&#39;s the 30 year old</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.980" end="00:49:19.650" style="s2">religion yes it&#39;s a 30 year old religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.010" end="00:49:23.640" style="s2">and you know no 30 year old religion is</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.650" end="00:49:26.820" style="s2">its is wise we we&#39;ve tried a few times</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.640" end="00:49:29.490" style="s2">before a lot of people die yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.820" end="00:49:30.990" style="s2">alright so now let&#39;s pick up the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.490" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2">Yale threat because I think things</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.990" end="00:49:37.230" style="s2">convert so there&#39;s there&#39;s a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.440" end="00:49:38.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard routinely and you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.230" end="00:49:40.320" style="s2">seen it a lot of different places but</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.370" end="00:49:42.750" style="s2">you know Yale what the Christakis this</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.320" end="00:49:45.060" style="s2">was particularly clear right you watched</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.750" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">these people chastising Nicholas</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.060" end="00:49:49.740" style="s2">Christakis and the courtyard there and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.010" end="00:49:51.990" style="s2">you know this is easy for you and me to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.740" end="00:49:54.030" style="s2">interpret because we never you know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.990" end="00:49:56.280" style="s2">was an early version but we&#39;ve now seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.030" end="00:49:57.840" style="s2">enough of these instances that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.280" end="00:50:00.270" style="s2">you know it&#39;s that same tragic thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.840" end="00:50:04.440" style="s2">unfolding but what you hear as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.270" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">critique is these people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.440" end="00:50:11.400" style="s2">chastising Nicholas are among the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:13.740" style="s2">privileged people anywhere right how is</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.400" end="00:50:17.310" style="s2">it that they are not recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.740" end="00:50:20.250" style="s2">they&#39;re at Yale but I actually think</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.310" end="00:50:23.130" style="s2">this critique is wrong and here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.250" end="00:50:27.150" style="s2">because we are built for lineage against</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.130" end="00:50:29.519" style="s2">lineage competition if you are a member</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.150" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">of a lineage that has faced</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.519" end="00:50:35.069" style="s2">cooller obstacle an unfair obstacle and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:37.109" style="s2">then you as a member of that lineage</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.069" end="00:50:39.509" style="s2">have found yourself in a privileged</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.109" end="00:50:42.029" style="s2">position yeah it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.509" end="00:50:45.029" style="s2">I think quite natural for you to speak</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.029" end="00:50:48.479" style="s2">on behalf of the lineage that is still</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.029" end="00:50:50.459" style="s2">lagging yeah and so I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.479" end="00:50:52.049" style="s2">confusing when you see it on a screen</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.459" end="00:50:55.189" style="s2">because what you see is an individual</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.300" end="00:55:50.310" style="s2">think it is selfish in more than one way</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.190" end="00:55:53.990" style="s2">that in effect basically people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.310" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to question these</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.990" end="00:56:00.360" style="s2">positive sounding sympathy isms</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:03.690" style="s2">find themselves as pawns of a movement</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.360" end="00:56:05.220" style="s2">that not only does it not really care</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.690" end="00:56:07.110" style="s2">about their well-being in the end yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.220" end="00:56:08.790" style="s2">it has no plan for how to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.110" end="00:56:12.090" style="s2">them and so you know you get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.790" end="00:56:15.590" style="s2">college students to revolt against their</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.090" end="00:56:18.090" style="s2">institution and to reject science and</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.590" end="00:56:19.800" style="s2">then what are they going to do I call it</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.090" end="00:56:21.780" style="s2">king of the rubble thinking they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.800" end="00:56:23.880" style="s2">gonna be kings of the rubble Kings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.780" end="00:56:25.950" style="s2">harder it&#39;s hard to be too advanced</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.880" end="00:56:27.150" style="s2">within this system let&#39;s turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.950" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">rubble and we&#39;ll be the Kings</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.150" end="00:56:32.100" style="s2">do they know they&#39;re very sensitive I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:33.900" style="s2">gonna be okay if it turns to ball right</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.100" end="00:56:35.400" style="s2">in the streets no I think this is you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.900" end="00:56:37.380" style="s2">know exactly what&#39;s gonna happen and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.400" end="00:56:40.800" style="s2">actually I think there&#39;s a trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.380" end="00:56:43.980" style="s2">that inside of the university system</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.800" end="00:56:46.650" style="s2">yeah you either have the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.980" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">science or you do not yeah if you do not</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.650" end="00:56:50.610" style="s2">have the ability to do science inside of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:52.140" style="s2">the university system it will move out</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.610" end="00:56:54.150" style="s2">of the university system and it will</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.140" end="00:56:56.070" style="s2">become something else yeah at which</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:56:57.900" style="s2">point you will have universities that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.070" end="00:56:59.340" style="s2">don&#39;t have that thing I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.900" end="00:57:01.830" style="s2">they&#39;re viable I think they will</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.340" end="00:57:03.780" style="s2">collapse and so the point is to turn</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.830" end="00:57:05.970" style="s2">your university upside down and reject</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.780" end="00:57:07.220" style="s2">the science is to cause the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.970" end="00:57:09.800" style="s2">maybe does off</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.220" end="00:57:11.420" style="s2">you the possibility of pulling yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.800" end="00:57:14.869" style="s2">up by your bootstraps or the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.420" end="00:57:17.060" style="s2">and wrecking it and yeah king of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.869" end="00:57:19.550" style="s2">rebel is about it&#39;s also yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.060" end="00:57:21.590" style="s2">goal of university I mean Jonathan Hite</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.550" end="00:57:24.440" style="s2">talks about this he figured this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.590" end="00:57:26.750" style="s2">out quite well on on it from a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.440" end="00:57:29.960" style="s2">different angle to I&#39;m looking in at at</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.750" end="00:57:32.599" style="s2">it but the tailless thing have you heard</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.960" end="00:57:34.609" style="s2">his Taylor&#39;s thing so he either the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.599" end="00:57:36.470" style="s2">Taylor&#39;s of the university it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.609" end="00:57:38.900" style="s2">about truth oh and now it&#39;s about so now</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.470" end="00:57:41.900" style="s2">it&#39;s about change and that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.900" end="00:57:43.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the the function of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.900" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">university has been hijacked it has been</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.970" end="00:57:47.840" style="s2">adequately we need something we need</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:50.810" style="s2">something we need that scientific rigor</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.840" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.810" end="00:57:55.070" style="s2">prescriptive because the culture has to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:57:57.050" style="s2">look after the prescription of that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.070" end="00:58:00.280" style="s2">and politics and whatnot not though not</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.050" end="00:58:03.830" style="s2">the Academy when the Academy pulls in</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.280" end="00:58:05.960" style="s2">change like how to use the science yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.830" end="00:58:08.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a church that&#39;s why I put a</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.960" end="00:58:11.030" style="s2">prescriptive sociology based on moral</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.900" end="00:58:12.740" style="s2">intuition that&#39;s what this side of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.030" end="00:58:14.420" style="s2">Academy is doing and through the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.740" end="00:58:17.660" style="s2">administrative class is taking over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.420" end="00:58:19.720" style="s2">entire trying to you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.660" end="00:58:23.480" style="s2">hitting up against a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.720" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">trouble but that&#39;s the goal there in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.480" end="00:58:27.500" style="s2">church business so they&#39;re trying to I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:30.320" style="s2">mean the academies were with scholastic</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.500" end="00:58:32.510" style="s2">monasteries before they became they</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.320" end="00:58:34.070" style="s2">devoted themselves to science but they</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.510" end="00:58:36.650" style="s2">could head back there they could head</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.070" end="00:58:38.330" style="s2">back there and what they are doing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.650" end="00:58:41.720" style="s2">at the moment is that they are allowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.330" end="00:58:45.290" style="s2">that basically administrators are</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.720" end="00:58:47.690" style="s2">pandering to the Church of moral</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.290" end="00:58:51.530" style="s2">intuitions yeah and they are not leaving</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.690" end="00:58:54.830" style="s2">a firewall between those folks and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.530" end="00:58:56.180" style="s2">sciences and I mean this is why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.830" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">sitting here talking to me yeah is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.180" end="00:59:01.490" style="s2">they came after me it&#39;s not an accident</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:03.290" style="s2">that they&#39;ve not an accident is it right</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.490" end="00:59:05.170" style="s2">no I see this is the weird thing is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.290" end="00:59:07.400" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s because you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.170" end="00:59:09.140" style="s2">confidence in your science that you kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.400" end="00:59:11.330" style="s2">of stood just you stood against them and</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.140" end="00:59:13.099" style="s2">then they came after you because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.330" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s the hardest thing isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.099" end="00:59:18.380" style="s2">much of this so much of this movement it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:21.050" style="s2">seems so it seems so natural yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.380" end="00:59:24.210" style="s2">someone has to know is like is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.050" end="00:59:25.890" style="s2">is this some kind of the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.210" end="00:59:28.260" style="s2">working through humans and then there</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.890" end="00:59:31.380" style="s2">will naturally go to that that place or</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.260" end="00:59:34.770" style="s2">is it explicit I think on you in your</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.380" end="00:59:36.690" style="s2">case it would be that I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.770" end="00:59:38.310" style="s2">personality right like you well if</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.690" end="00:59:39.780" style="s2">someone&#39;s got if you know something and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.310" end="00:59:41.609" style="s2">someone comes after you gonna go against</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.780" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">them and that&#39;s oil and water I guess</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.609" end="00:59:48.030" style="s2">yeah although I mean I think your</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:50.760" style="s2">question has a precise answer I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.030" end="00:59:55.470" style="s2">know it precisely yeah I do have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.760" end="00:59:57.900" style="s2">of what it is there is a very rare</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.470" end="01:00:01.890" style="s2">characteristic in humans the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.900" end="01:00:05.520" style="s2">characteristic involves not being</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.890" end="01:00:10.410" style="s2">persuaded by the degree to which other</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.520" end="01:00:12.359" style="s2">people believe something in general a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.410" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">human being who is faced with a room</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.359" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">full of people who disagrees with them</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:22.650" style="s2">will change their opinion and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:24.630" style="s2">this is not entirely nuts the reason is</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.650" end="01:00:28.740" style="s2">because if you think about an ancestor</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:31.170" style="s2">an ancestor who was alone in their</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.740" end="01:00:33.660" style="s2">opinion on something that mattered was</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.170" end="01:00:35.609" style="s2">in danger mm-hmm right they were in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.660" end="01:00:37.619" style="s2">danger of being outcast because even if</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.609" end="01:00:39.540" style="s2">they were right being alone in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.619" end="01:00:42.990" style="s2">belief is rowing in the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.540" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">and so we are wired to be very</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.990" end="01:00:47.670" style="s2">frightened by the prospect of being out</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:49.619" style="s2">of phase with other people on the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.670" end="01:00:52.200" style="s2">hand I believe that a certain number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.619" end="01:00:54.450" style="s2">people have to be capable of that thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.200" end="01:00:56.550" style="s2">it probably comes at a substantial cost</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.450" end="01:01:00.060" style="s2">it does is why I&#39;m sitting here in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.550" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">room and not working on high scale</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.060" end="01:01:04.560" style="s2">productions back home and in Australia</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:07.320" style="s2">it right that theme right it&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.560" end="01:01:09.330" style="s2">cost it&#39;s a high car oh I often think of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.320" end="01:01:12.089" style="s2">it as a disability like not being able</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.330" end="01:01:13.740" style="s2">to naturally go into the room and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.089" end="01:01:15.270" style="s2">just become one of the other people like</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.740" end="01:01:17.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you find yourself on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.270" end="01:01:20.280" style="s2">outskirts of a lot of projects a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.930" end="01:01:21.869" style="s2">you know institutions and things like</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">that like sometimes I look at the people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.869" end="01:01:27.720" style="s2">who can just be yeah magic oh sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:31.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve got this weird disability that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.720" end="01:01:33.869" style="s2">makes me it&#39;s funny I have no desire to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.080" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">be on the other side I died I was going</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.869" end="01:01:36.350" style="s2">to hypothesize</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">that you have exactly the same thing I</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.350" end="01:01:39.170" style="s2">think the place where we differs there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:41.320" style="s2">some part of you that feels like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.170" end="01:01:43.970" style="s2">would be easier and my feeling is I</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.320" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine what you got a few more</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.970" end="01:01:47.990" style="s2">years under your belt and maybe you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:50.090" style="s2">got your brother and stuff so I find my</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.990" end="01:01:53.030" style="s2">little tribes I got much room yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.090" end="01:01:56.930" style="s2">I mean this is true having Eric and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.030" end="01:01:58.610" style="s2">Heather yeah a reality check you know at</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.930" end="01:02:01.460" style="s2">worst a phone call away</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.610" end="01:02:04.070" style="s2">changed every day I would be this way</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.460" end="01:02:06.710" style="s2">anyway but the degree to which I might</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.070" end="01:02:08.420" style="s2">imagine I was crazy yeah would be much</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.710" end="01:02:10.700" style="s2">greater that&#39;s the hot pot as well when</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.420" end="01:02:12.290" style="s2">everyone around you it makes you feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.700" end="01:02:14.840" style="s2">creative nice and they call you crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.290" end="01:02:16.250" style="s2">they did I hate you like as well and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.840" end="01:02:17.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like because he was showing some of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.250" end="01:02:19.310" style="s2">them something that I want to say I</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.420" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know well is I wanna you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.310" end="01:02:25.160" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m just chronically crippled in</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:28.070" style="s2">this direction but I do want to steal</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.160" end="01:02:30.170" style="s2">man the thing that they are applying</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.070" end="01:02:31.490" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s a real thing and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.170" end="01:02:33.830" style="s2">actually makes sense it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.490" end="01:02:36.200" style="s2">make sense here at all okay so the point</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.830" end="01:02:39.170" style="s2">I used to make to my students I used to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.200" end="01:02:42.290" style="s2">talk about him there was this great film</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.170" end="01:02:45.230" style="s2">called the hunters about the cones on</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.290" end="01:02:48.320" style="s2">the Bushman and basically an</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.230" end="01:02:51.470" style="s2">anthropologist followed a kung son</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.320" end="01:02:53.600" style="s2">hunting party on a hunt and they hunted</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.470" end="01:02:57.380" style="s2">you a giraffe and kill it and he</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.600" end="01:02:58.970" style="s2">documents it and anyway so I would talk</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.380" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">to my students about what about somebody</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.970" end="01:03:05.690" style="s2">who was on such a hunting party who</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:08.390" style="s2">looked at the leaves of a tree you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.690" end="01:03:10.070" style="s2">imagine some tree like a birch in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.390" end="01:03:11.420" style="s2">the bottom side and the top side of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.070" end="01:03:15.290" style="s2">leaf four very different colors and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.420" end="01:03:17.990" style="s2">shake in the wind that person might look</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.290" end="01:03:22.670" style="s2">at the leaf and think you know that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.990" end="01:03:24.440" style="s2">implies something about a binary you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.670" end="01:03:25.970" style="s2">might be able to encode all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.440" end="01:03:27.650" style="s2">things in a binary indeed there might be</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.970" end="01:03:29.960" style="s2">all sorts of things about us they are</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.650" end="01:03:31.400" style="s2">encoded in some sort of binary form that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.960" end="01:03:33.590" style="s2">person might have had the first thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.400" end="01:03:37.370" style="s2">that ultimately thousands of years later</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.590" end="01:03:39.650" style="s2">leads to a computer yeah right the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.370" end="01:03:41.390" style="s2">answer to the guy who won&#39;t shut up</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.650" end="01:03:43.330" style="s2">about the shimmering of the leaves is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.390" end="01:03:46.450" style="s2">shut up</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.330" end="01:03:48.520" style="s2">we&#39;re hunting yeah starvation is what</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.450" end="01:03:50.380" style="s2">happens if we don&#39;t do it well yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.520" end="01:03:52.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about with</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.380" end="01:03:53.500" style="s2">respect to those leaves but stop being</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.090" end="01:03:57.160" style="s2">on about it or you&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.500" end="01:03:59.650" style="s2">yeah right so my point would be there</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.160" end="01:04:02.500" style="s2">are times when pulling in the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.650" end="01:04:05.470" style="s2">direction is vastly more important than</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:07.090" style="s2">seeing some precise truth and then there</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.470" end="01:04:08.860" style="s2">are other times where exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.090" end="01:04:10.540" style="s2">opposite thing is that yeah yeah and my</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.860" end="01:04:12.610" style="s2">feeling is we are in exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.540" end="01:04:14.230" style="s2">opposite case right we need people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.610" end="01:04:15.880" style="s2">see with clarity because the people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.230" end="01:04:17.860" style="s2">know where they&#39;re going are confused</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.880" end="01:04:20.350" style="s2">every single one of them right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.860" end="01:04:21.910" style="s2">people are looking there must be another</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.350" end="01:04:23.110" style="s2">people looking for the people with</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.910" end="01:04:24.700" style="s2">clarity as well and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.110" end="01:04:26.410" style="s2">people standing on soap boxes that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.700" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">have that clarity they&#39;re potentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.410" end="01:04:31.690" style="s2">the guys looking at the branch and going</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:36.210" style="s2">what if that&#39;s some kind of absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.690" end="01:04:36.210" style="s2">backward binary with an upside down yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:41.230" style="s2">yeah I think a lot of people have this</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.160" end="01:04:43.420" style="s2">sense right I have the sense that we got</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.230" end="01:04:45.160" style="s2">to look for these people well I want</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.420" end="01:04:46.900" style="s2">them it&#39;s times times like viously</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.160" end="01:04:49.330" style="s2">strange times wherever messiahs pop up</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.900" end="01:04:51.190" style="s2">and cults bubble up out of nowhere yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.330" end="01:04:53.260" style="s2">both things happen is that you get some</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.190" end="01:04:55.270" style="s2">people who actually have insight and do</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.260" end="01:04:57.250" style="s2">see ya half through the bottleneck and</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.270" end="01:05:01.020" style="s2">then you have other people who sound</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.250" end="01:05:05.020" style="s2">similar but either are delusional or are</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.020" end="01:05:06.369" style="s2">disingenuous well I think I&#39;m did you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.020" end="01:05:08.590" style="s2">have a point you wanted to go on well</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.369" end="01:05:10.570" style="s2">that&#39;d mean I do have a significant one</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.590" end="01:05:12.070" style="s2">yeah yeah no no go on I want you to keep</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.570" end="01:05:13.510" style="s2">going so this this all leads to</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.070" end="01:05:14.950" style="s2">somewhere else that I wanted to bring up</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.510" end="01:05:18.130" style="s2">with you yeah which has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.950" end="01:05:20.740" style="s2">something that your film revealed to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.130" end="01:05:22.810" style="s2">about the event that I lived through the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.740" end="01:05:25.720" style="s2">one that I am now so identified with</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.810" end="01:05:27.640" style="s2">that I just didn&#39;t know yeah and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.720" end="01:05:29.530" style="s2">you&#39;ll see this all comes back to an</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.640" end="01:05:33.430" style="s2">earlier part of this conversation in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.530" end="01:05:36.670" style="s2">way that I think is useful I looked at</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.430" end="01:05:39.369" style="s2">the video of the moments where those</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.670" end="01:05:40.450" style="s2">students for people who haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.369" end="01:05:42.490" style="s2">or don&#39;t remember these are students</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.450" end="01:05:44.859" style="s2">I&#39;ve never met who came charging through</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.490" end="01:05:50.140" style="s2">the door chanting for me to be fired or</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.859" end="01:05:52.420" style="s2">to resign they you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.140" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">surrounding me I&#39;m trying to film them</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.420" end="01:05:55.420" style="s2">which they want to block but they very</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:56.980" style="s2">much want to film it so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.420" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">put into the world as you say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.980" end="01:06:02.230" style="s2">proud</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:03.400" style="s2">it and I reacted away so many of the not</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.230" end="01:06:04.870" style="s2">a single one of them knew me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.400" end="01:06:08.770" style="s2">think I&#39;d had a conversation with any of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.870" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">them but some of them didn&#39;t even really</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.770" end="01:06:13.510" style="s2">have any familiarity with who I was or</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:16.180" style="s2">why I was being protested I learned much</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.510" end="01:06:17.320" style="s2">later that they had been sent to protest</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.180" end="01:06:19.210" style="s2">they had been given a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.320" end="01:06:21.660" style="s2">yeah and at the point that I stopped</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.210" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2">read that I reacted in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.660" end="01:06:25.750" style="s2">confounded their story of the racist</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:28.600" style="s2">monster that they had been meant to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.750" end="01:06:34.870" style="s2">protest they were like not sure what to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.600" end="01:06:37.600" style="s2">do yeah as the emotion right so they</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.870" end="01:06:39.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a point in the video where very</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.600" end="01:06:41.890" style="s2">tragically from my perspective they go</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.940" end="01:06:45.040" style="s2">from actually interacting with me to</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.890" end="01:06:46.720" style="s2">just chanting one yeah the paper and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.040" end="01:06:50.830" style="s2">you listen to what they chant on that</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.720" end="01:06:52.600" style="s2">paper they&#39;re talking about who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.830" end="01:06:55.900" style="s2">there to represent yeah they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.600" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">making an appeal to my students they</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.900" end="01:07:03.400" style="s2">wanted my students to flee from me and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:05.020" style="s2">to join that amorphous moral intuition</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.400" end="01:07:06.250" style="s2">church on the spot</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.020" end="01:07:07.930" style="s2">imagine what that scene would have</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.250" end="01:07:11.320" style="s2">looked like if my students had done that</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.930" end="01:07:14.140" style="s2">right now it didn&#39;t even occur to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.320" end="01:07:15.700" style="s2">even four months afterwards until I saw</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.140" end="01:07:18.970" style="s2">your film it did not occur to me that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.700" end="01:07:21.910" style="s2">what they were hoping and inspecting was</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.970" end="01:07:24.280" style="s2">that I would be abandoned by my students</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.910" end="01:07:26.380" style="s2">my students weren&#39;t going to do yet and</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.280" end="01:07:28.240" style="s2">the reason my students weren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.380" end="01:07:29.950" style="s2">do that was because of the dynamic that</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.240" end="01:07:31.300" style="s2">existed in my classroom which none of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.950" end="01:07:33.370" style="s2">those students knew because they hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.300" end="01:07:36.250" style="s2">been my student Yeah right Heather and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.370" end="01:07:37.570" style="s2">well not only that can can I yeah I did</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.250" end="01:07:40.150" style="s2">hear a story of one of your students</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.570" end="01:07:42.130" style="s2">that said that you&#39;re at the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.150" end="01:07:44.470" style="s2">teaching them about witch hunts oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.130" end="01:07:46.510" style="s2">it was on the board like so a before</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.470" end="01:07:48.130" style="s2">what kind of I mean science is kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.510" end="01:07:51.040" style="s2">little bit of an inoculation against</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.130" end="01:07:52.690" style="s2">this kind of stuff if you can if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.040" end="01:07:55.120" style="s2">there with it right like well let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.690" end="01:07:57.310" style="s2">clear about why the witch hunt stuff was</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.120" end="01:07:59.880" style="s2">on the board yeah okay there are two</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.310" end="01:08:02.530" style="s2">reasons one of them you could say was</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.880" end="01:08:04.810" style="s2">almost prophetic in this case yeah which</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.530" end="01:08:07.540" style="s2">was that the subject matter of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.810" end="01:08:09.100" style="s2">course the final course that I probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.540" end="01:08:10.190" style="s2">will ever teach is a college professor</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.100" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.190" end="01:08:15.740" style="s2">subject matter of the course was if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:20.390" style="s2">imagine that civilization is headed off</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.740" end="01:08:22.190" style="s2">a cliff there are two questions what</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.390" end="01:08:24.620" style="s2">should we be doing instead of what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.190" end="01:08:26.780" style="s2">are doing and how might you shift</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.620" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">civilization to start doing that thing I</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.780" end="01:08:30.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know anybody who knows the answer</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:33.560" style="s2">to the second thing there&#39;s no good</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.620" end="01:08:35.660" style="s2">answer to how you would get power and</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.560" end="01:08:38.150" style="s2">apply it properly to make things work</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.660" end="01:08:40.280" style="s2">so let&#39;s abandon that question let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.150" end="01:08:43.310" style="s2">focus on the second question if we had a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.280" end="01:08:45.500" style="s2">mechanism to set something in motion</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.310" end="01:08:47.150" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t have the defects of our</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.500" end="01:08:47.690" style="s2">system and wouldn&#39;t run us off a similar</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.150" end="01:08:49.760" style="s2">cliff</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.690" end="01:08:51.200" style="s2">what were those rules rules be right</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.760" end="01:08:53.360" style="s2">because free ourselves from the question</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.200" end="01:08:58.010" style="s2">of how and focus entirely on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.360" end="01:08:59.960" style="s2">question of what well that is the answer</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.010" end="01:09:02.540" style="s2">to the question that the church you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.960" end="01:09:03.770" style="s2">talking about does not ask right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.540" end="01:09:06.290" style="s2">church that you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.770" end="01:09:08.900" style="s2">stuck in how do we fix this object and</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.290" end="01:09:10.700" style="s2">get our share from it yeah rather than</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.900" end="01:09:13.400" style="s2">maybe the object is just around its</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.700" end="01:09:15.470" style="s2">course and maybe it&#39;s time to think of a</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.400" end="01:09:18.020" style="s2">new object in which casing in the place</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.470" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">yeah right no proactive solutions ever</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.020" end="01:09:22.310" style="s2">it&#39;s the whole thing is comprised the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:24.410" style="s2">whole thing is broken yeah it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.310" end="01:09:27.980" style="s2">kill us all if we don&#39;t fix it and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.410" end="01:09:29.960" style="s2">let&#39;s think about you know maybe this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.980" end="01:09:32.120" style="s2">just easier to solve in terms of solving</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.960" end="01:09:34.070" style="s2">each of the issues and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.120" end="01:09:36.320" style="s2">mean you know I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.070" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">utopian solutions I&#39;m talking Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.320" end="01:09:39.260" style="s2">optimal solutions where you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:41.030" style="s2">hundred percent free but you&#39;re eighty</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.260" end="01:09:43.190" style="s2">percent free and you know what so is</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.030" end="01:09:51.200" style="s2">everybody else because it&#39;s a quite fair</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.190" end="01:09:53.330" style="s2">system yeah etcetera but the the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.200" end="01:09:55.220" style="s2">second reason that witch-hunts were on</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.330" end="01:09:56.900" style="s2">the board in my class was that I was</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.220" end="01:10:00.170" style="s2">having this experience where as the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.900" end="01:10:04.610" style="s2">college descended into madness I took it</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.170" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">on myself to go to every meeting which</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.610" end="01:10:08.750" style="s2">nobody does there are just too many</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:10.520" style="s2">meetings and so people go to some</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.750" end="01:10:13.610" style="s2">percentage every year I started going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.520" end="01:10:16.310" style="s2">everyone because bombshells were dropped</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.610" end="01:10:17.930" style="s2">at everyone and nobody was in a position</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.310" end="01:10:20.600" style="s2">to track everything that happened yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.930" end="01:10:22.430" style="s2">right and so it sort of felt like it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.600" end="01:10:23.960" style="s2">a necessary thing and so I started to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.430" end="01:10:27.590" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.960" end="01:10:31.130" style="s2">what that meant was that part of my mind</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.590" end="01:10:32.300" style="s2">was beginning to see the entire picture</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.130" end="01:10:34.580" style="s2">of what was happening to this</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.300" end="01:10:37.010" style="s2">institution and I was becoming a target</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.580" end="01:10:38.600" style="s2">because I was the person who anytime</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.010" end="01:10:40.340" style="s2">they left an opportunity to raise your</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.600" end="01:10:42.470" style="s2">hand and say hey this is not such a good</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.340" end="01:10:45.800" style="s2">idea yeah you know my hand went up and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.470" end="01:10:47.330" style="s2">so anyway as I was being accused of more</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.800" end="01:10:49.370" style="s2">and more preposterous stuff by</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.330" end="01:10:51.500" style="s2">colleagues you know who shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.370" end="01:10:53.150" style="s2">accusing me of anything I&#39;m just simple</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.500" end="01:10:54.500" style="s2">I&#39;m doing my job I&#39;m raising my hand and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.150" end="01:10:59.030" style="s2">asking questions about what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.500" end="01:11:03.230" style="s2">you know as that was unfolding it began</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.030" end="01:11:07.490" style="s2">to become clear that I was going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.230" end="01:11:10.580" style="s2">become the scapegoat and so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.490" end="01:11:13.630" style="s2">imagine that that&#39;s all true and imagine</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.580" end="01:11:16.910" style="s2">a college in which the good professors</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.630" end="01:11:20.230" style="s2">have very close relationships with their</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.910" end="01:11:23.300" style="s2">class yeah where I am NOT just some</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.230" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">abstraction to them but I come in and to</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.300" end="01:11:27.470" style="s2">the extent that I&#39;m preoccupied by the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:28.370" style="s2">fact that my colleagues are going and</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.470" end="01:11:30.770" style="s2">saying around me</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.370" end="01:11:32.150" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s no honest way not to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.770" end="01:11:33.560" style="s2">some sort of interaction with them and</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.150" end="01:11:36.350" style="s2">say look here&#39;s what&#39;s throwing me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.560" end="01:11:37.340" style="s2">watching crazy stuff unfold in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.350" end="01:11:40.310" style="s2">college and I don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.340" end="01:11:43.910" style="s2">about and so you know they had some</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.310" end="01:11:46.570" style="s2">sense of something that they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.910" end="01:11:47.810" style="s2">see over in faculty space yeah going</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.570" end="01:11:49.670" style="s2">bonkers</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.810" end="01:11:57.460" style="s2">yeah and then it emerges through the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.670" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">door however here&#39;s the tough part</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.460" end="01:12:03.380" style="s2">there was a nasty accusation that was</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:06.680" style="s2">periodically levelled at Heather and me</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.380" end="01:12:08.780" style="s2">while we were teaching it was that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.680" end="01:12:10.850" style="s2">community of very committed students who</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.780" end="01:12:12.860" style="s2">circulated between our classes and who</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.850" end="01:12:14.990" style="s2">became very energized about evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.860" end="01:12:19.400" style="s2">biology that that was a cult know in</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.990" end="01:12:20.720" style="s2">writing yeah and it wasn&#39;t and you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.400" end="01:12:23.330" style="s2">sometimes students would bring this up</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.720" end="01:12:24.590" style="s2">like they&#39;re people who chat would</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.330" end="01:12:26.300" style="s2">challenge them yell you&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.590" end="01:12:27.440" style="s2">call of Breton Heather can i interject</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.300" end="01:12:31.100" style="s2">there for a second because I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.440" end="01:12:33.140" style="s2">evergreen was is I mean it had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.100" end="01:12:34.340" style="s2">beautiful structure but it also had the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.140" end="01:12:36.210" style="s2">most dangerous structure you can have</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.340" end="01:12:38.219" style="s2">finger because you</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.210" end="01:12:39.660" style="s2">universities when you when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.219" end="01:12:41.489" style="s2">introducing people to knowledge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.660" end="01:12:44.130" style="s2">like one step out from a cult really</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.489" end="01:12:46.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just depends on what</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.130" end="01:12:48.660" style="s2">you want to do with that and then to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.320" end="01:12:53.010" style="s2">put with students for that long a period</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.660" end="01:12:55.170" style="s2">of time you guys going away with them</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.010" end="01:12:57.750" style="s2">Naima was doing projects with them</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.170" end="01:13:00.840" style="s2">outside of the class and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.750" end="01:13:04.440" style="s2">bond yeah if it gets created so you</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.840" end="01:13:06.300" style="s2">could see I&#39;d be evergreen is probably a</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.440" end="01:13:08.460" style="s2">series of call a cult right like well</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.300" end="01:13:10.110" style="s2">knowledge knowledge cults some summer</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.460" end="01:13:11.340" style="s2">some are good some of that I would I</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.110" end="01:13:12.660" style="s2">would totally phrase this a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.340" end="01:13:16.140" style="s2">way no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.660" end="01:13:19.260" style="s2">wrong I just think the labels are what</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.140" end="01:13:21.210" style="s2">it is is that cult is the pathological</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.260" end="01:13:23.190" style="s2">version of something that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.210" end="01:13:25.469" style="s2">exactly sure what to name it yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.190" end="01:13:27.630" style="s2">yeah so oh do you know what it is what</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.469" end="01:13:29.160" style="s2">so I have been thinking about this so</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.630" end="01:13:31.500" style="s2">you would have brought people in in not</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.160" end="01:13:32.910" style="s2">not too dissimilar very dishonest</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.500" end="01:13:34.739" style="s2">fashion but it&#39;s it&#39;s he&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.910" end="01:13:36.930" style="s2">knowledge it does excellent things for</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.739" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">us you can learn it too and then go out</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.930" end="01:13:38.190" style="s2">in the world and do what you want with</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:40.770" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.190" end="01:13:42.469" style="s2">yeah whereas a name teaching to current</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.770" end="01:13:45.930" style="s2">transgressor you know this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.469" end="01:13:48.810" style="s2">milieu is we have the solutions we know</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.930" end="01:13:50.340" style="s2">what we want you to think and we will</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.810" end="01:13:52.910" style="s2">instruct you and then you go out in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.340" end="01:13:58.160" style="s2">world and be just like us it&#39;s it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.910" end="01:14:01.400" style="s2">so you&#39;re absolutely right that a</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.160" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">university a functional one yeah is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.400" end="01:14:07.170" style="s2">series of things that have some of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">components of a cult yeah the real deep</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.170" end="01:14:13.350" style="s2">question is do the people at the head of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:14.340" style="s2">the room are they honorable and do they</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.350" end="01:14:17.580" style="s2">know something</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.340" end="01:14:20.610" style="s2">in which case using that that power</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.580" end="01:14:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s there can be liberating for</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.610" end="01:14:26.400" style="s2">students or are they self-interested or</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.080" end="01:14:29.610" style="s2">confused in a way that they will mislead</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.400" end="01:14:34.739" style="s2">these PDS into self yes and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.610" end="01:14:37.050" style="s2">I used to I&#39;m always cautious about</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.739" end="01:14:39.780" style="s2">saying this because seduction has a</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.050" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">sexual connotation yeah that isn&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.780" end="01:14:44.280" style="s2">of what I&#39;m talking about yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:46.680" style="s2">seduction is a question of making</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.280" end="01:14:49.470" style="s2">somebody wants something to motivate</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.680" end="01:14:51.210" style="s2">them yeah right that can be used for ill</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.470" end="01:14:54.840" style="s2">Rakeem used for good but I always</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.210" end="01:14:57.150" style="s2">thought that pedagogy teach mmm was best</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.840" end="01:14:59.580" style="s2">thought of as a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.150" end="01:15:01.380" style="s2">seduction if you&#39;re trying to get people</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.580" end="01:15:03.000" style="s2">to do stuff by threatening them with a</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.380" end="01:15:06.660" style="s2">loss of credit or a bad grade if they</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.000" end="01:15:08.880" style="s2">don&#39;t do it you&#39;re not gonna jump but if</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.660" end="01:15:10.860" style="s2">you say look I&#39;m not gonna make you do</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.880" end="01:15:13.800" style="s2">this I&#39;m not even necessarily gonna give</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.860" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">you a bad evaluation if you don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.800" end="01:15:19.530" style="s2">well but you should want what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:22.290" style="s2">to deliver because you&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.530" end="01:15:23.820" style="s2">powerful if you have it yeah and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.290" end="01:15:26.850" style="s2">know in on my first day of class</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.820" end="01:15:29.990" style="s2">typically I gave a hell of a speech</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.850" end="01:15:33.060" style="s2">every time and it was basically you</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.990" end="01:15:34.500" style="s2">might not want to be in this class here</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.060" end="01:15:36.390" style="s2">are the reasons you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.500" end="01:15:39.720" style="s2">here here are the things I&#39;m not good at</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.390" end="01:15:41.610" style="s2">as a professor and then if none of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.720" end="01:15:43.560" style="s2">scares you off here are the reasons you</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.610" end="01:15:45.750" style="s2">might want to stick around yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.560" end="01:15:48.390" style="s2">would say you know I used to speak in</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.750" end="01:15:50.460" style="s2">what I would call riddles and the idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.390" end="01:15:51.990" style="s2">of speaking in riddles is that it causes</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.460" end="01:15:53.160" style="s2">the conscious mind to become active</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.990" end="01:15:54.600" style="s2">because you can&#39;t parse them</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.160" end="01:15:55.890" style="s2">straightforwardly they weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.600" end="01:15:57.510" style="s2">riddles yeah they were just little</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.890" end="01:15:58.860" style="s2">paradoxes and I would say look I</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.510" end="01:16:01.290" style="s2">actually want you to leave my class</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.860" end="01:16:03.630" style="s2">knowing less than you did when you came</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.290" end="01:16:06.030" style="s2">in but the stuff that you know I want it</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.630" end="01:16:09.330" style="s2">to be much more powerful and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.030" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">you could graduate college with the</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.330" end="01:16:14.910" style="s2">equivalent of a giant trailer full of</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.000" end="01:16:17.460" style="s2">knowledge right or you could have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.910" end="01:16:19.530" style="s2">little backpack full of stuff that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.460" end="01:16:21.780" style="s2">powerful that it actually outweighs</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.530" end="01:16:23.670" style="s2">what&#39;s in that trailer and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.780" end="01:16:27.030" style="s2">stuff that you should pursue so the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.670" end="01:16:28.410" style="s2">interesting thing here is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.030" end="01:16:30.030" style="s2">trying to get in the head of the people</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.410" end="01:16:31.350" style="s2">that I&#39;m studying and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.030" end="01:16:36.060" style="s2">operating from a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.350" end="01:16:39.870" style="s2">worldview science is a cult to them like</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.060" end="01:16:41.580" style="s2">the the the the norms the bell curves</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.870" end="01:16:44.220" style="s2">are a cult and they&#39;re they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.580" end="01:16:45.930" style="s2">I call them the second culture because</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.220" end="01:16:48.120" style="s2">they&#39;re designing a second culture based</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.930" end="01:16:51.990" style="s2">on being other from the main culture</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.120" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">yeah and if you this seduction you talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.990" end="01:16:56.340" style="s2">about it is it&#39;s everywhere if you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.480" end="01:16:57.900" style="s2">get if you get a camera in any one of</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.340" end="01:16:58.930" style="s2">these rooms there&#39;s it&#39;s this big</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.900" end="01:17:01.480" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.930" end="01:17:04.540" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s the seduction but the content</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.480" end="01:17:06.580" style="s2">is the contents know where it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.540" end="01:17:08.440" style="s2">somewhere it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a cohesive</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.580" end="01:17:11.230" style="s2">worldview now it&#39;s based on offense</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.440" end="01:17:13.420" style="s2">based rules but it has a different</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.230" end="01:17:19.030" style="s2">metaphysics it&#39;s it&#39;s like if you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.420" end="01:17:20.710" style="s2">to in order to buy in you have to shake</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.030" end="01:17:22.180" style="s2">the edges get some Western civilization</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.710" end="01:17:23.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s this queering thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.180" end="01:17:25.930" style="s2">all these strange things they do that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.640" end="01:17:28.360" style="s2">replicate what you would go through</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.930" end="01:17:30.310" style="s2">you&#39;re reborn into it right like you</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.360" end="01:17:33.010" style="s2">leave your family you leave the world of</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.310" end="01:17:37.840" style="s2">norms and then you&#39;re reborn into this</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.010" end="01:17:40.450" style="s2">new I guess it&#39;s a group of outsiders</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.840" end="01:17:42.280" style="s2">and they teach you that the world is</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.450" end="01:17:45.130" style="s2">designed in a completely different way</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.280" end="01:17:47.980" style="s2">than you had imagined and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.130" end="01:17:49.900" style="s2">completely destructive thing but I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.980" end="01:17:51.400" style="s2">imagine that they were building their</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.900" end="01:17:53.470" style="s2">own little cult and then they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.400" end="01:17:54.910" style="s2">this I can see how they could see what</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.470" end="01:17:55.300" style="s2">was going on in the other classes as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.910" end="01:17:58.120" style="s2">cult</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.300" end="01:18:00.460" style="s2">do they had to the kids its warring</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.120" end="01:18:02.170" style="s2">factions really it&#39;s it&#39;s warring</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.460" end="01:18:02.920" style="s2">factions you can see it using the</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.170" end="01:18:05.740" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.920" end="01:18:07.540" style="s2">oh the students are the soldiers in this</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.740" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">battle there&#39;s a tacit conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.540" end="01:18:11.620" style="s2">between the the students is an</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:13.990" style="s2">audiological conspiracy but the students</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.620" end="01:18:16.510" style="s2">and faculty and that&#39;s one thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.990" end="01:18:21.010" style="s2">want the student leaders and the faculty</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.510" end="01:18:23.710" style="s2">have this tacit yeah it&#39;s how to explain</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.010" end="01:18:25.660" style="s2">like the the way that institutional</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.710" end="01:18:27.460" style="s2">mechanisms are weaponized against</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.660" end="01:18:28.660" style="s2">certain teachers like yourself and Peter</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.460" end="01:18:30.970" style="s2">Bergeron and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.660" end="01:18:32.410" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s through a complaint the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.970" end="01:18:34.720" style="s2">complaints usually come from a student</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.410" end="01:18:36.760" style="s2">or someone who is sure but then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.720" end="01:18:38.200" style="s2">sudden the the institutional mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.760" end="01:18:40.780" style="s2">kicks into place and it uses that</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.200" end="01:18:42.970" style="s2">complaint to then asked ask the</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.780" end="01:18:44.290" style="s2">problematic person but it&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.970" end="01:18:48.880" style="s2">for usually from an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.290" end="01:18:50.830" style="s2">perspective not not like these are minor</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.880" end="01:18:52.120" style="s2">complaints these are very very minor</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.830" end="01:18:53.320" style="s2">complaints that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.120" end="01:18:57.790" style="s2">getting kicked out of their universe</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.320" end="01:19:00.250" style="s2">however totally and you know the irony</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.790" end="01:19:03.210" style="s2">of ironies was that one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.250" end="01:19:08.160" style="s2">that Heather and I were delivering was</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.210" end="01:19:11.080" style="s2">you know a Guns Germs and Steel Plus</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.160" end="01:19:12.110" style="s2">mechanism for understanding how we did</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.080" end="01:19:13.730" style="s2">end up where</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.110" end="01:19:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like the scientific version</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.730" end="01:19:19.460" style="s2">that to the extent that there are tools</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:21.710" style="s2">to be had to liberate us from the legacy</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.460" end="01:19:25.280" style="s2">of oppression they are scientific yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.710" end="01:19:26.840" style="s2">and so yes the the phony version had to</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.280" end="01:19:28.700" style="s2">come after the real version yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.840" end="01:19:32.060" style="s2">real version was very inconvenient just</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.700" end="01:19:33.470" style="s2">as any place where a person of color and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.060" end="01:19:35.570" style="s2">evergreen said they didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.470" end="01:19:37.340" style="s2">oppressed resulted in a allergic</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.570" end="01:19:41.960" style="s2">reaction these are the last ones the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.340" end="01:19:44.060" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.960" end="01:19:48.050" style="s2">so you you were you weren&#39;t a pathway so</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.060" end="01:19:49.940" style="s2">they so the the students that came to</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.050" end="01:19:51.530" style="s2">you we&#39;re told that you you were having</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.940" end="01:19:56.090" style="s2">a cult you say you were halfway through</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.530" end="01:20:01.250" style="s2">that story oh well so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.090" end="01:20:05.150" style="s2">question is what is the what is the the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.250" end="01:20:06.950" style="s2">version where the dynamics I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.150" end="01:20:08.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a cultist thing that Heather and</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.950" end="01:20:10.070" style="s2">I were doing wasn&#39;t remotely a culture</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.480" end="01:20:11.360" style="s2">but we would say to our own students</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.070" end="01:20:13.250" style="s2">when they would report to us that</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.360" end="01:20:15.650" style="s2">somebody had accused them of this they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.250" end="01:20:17.840" style="s2">say you know bunch of people said I was</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.650" end="01:20:20.180" style="s2">in the cult of Breton Heather it was a</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.840" end="01:20:23.420" style="s2">very simple response which was you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.180" end="01:20:25.610" style="s2">that in class you are expected to</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.420" end="01:20:27.500" style="s2">question us at the front yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.610" end="01:20:29.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference right absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.500" end="01:20:31.730" style="s2">expect and that if you don&#39;t do it I</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.180" end="01:20:33.320" style="s2">mean personally I used to engage in this</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.730" end="01:20:35.990" style="s2">thing which I have a feeling would look</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.320" end="01:20:38.060" style="s2">a little off if you didn&#39;t see enough of</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.990" end="01:20:40.250" style="s2">it to get what it was about but if I got</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.060" end="01:20:41.720" style="s2">the sense that a student was telling me</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.250" end="01:20:43.550" style="s2">what they thought I wanted to hear</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.720" end="01:20:45.890" style="s2">rather than what they would believe yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.550" end="01:20:48.260" style="s2">I would use that and I would lead them</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.890" end="01:20:50.990" style="s2">out onto a branch yeah you know by</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.260" end="01:20:52.400" style="s2">signaling what I wanted them to say and</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.990" end="01:20:54.080" style="s2">then I would cut the branch off behind</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.400" end="01:20:55.850" style="s2">look what we&#39;re talking about here the</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.080" end="01:20:59.090" style="s2">responsibility that you have as a</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.850" end="01:21:00.800" style="s2">teacher yeah it&#39;s actually very delicate</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.090" end="01:21:02.840" style="s2">and could potentially to be taken like</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.800" end="01:21:05.330" style="s2">think about how that responsibility can</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.840" end="01:21:07.340" style="s2">be taken Oh like that look and then look</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.330" end="01:21:09.740" style="s2">at the EDS ed schools this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.340" end="01:21:12.200" style="s2">exactly it is it&#39;s frankly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.740" end="01:21:15.530" style="s2">fucking sacred responsibility it really</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.200" end="01:21:18.170" style="s2">is a sacred responsibility and anybody</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.530" end="01:21:19.970" style="s2">who either doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.170" end="01:21:22.100" style="s2">talking about yeah or isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.970" end="01:21:24.680" style="s2">well-intentioned enough to wield that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.100" end="01:21:25.680" style="s2">thing carefully is a huge hazard to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.680" end="01:21:30.570" style="s2">people yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.680" end="01:21:32.280" style="s2">their classes and and not only that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.570" end="01:21:35.520" style="s2">can scale that human up there is a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.280" end="01:21:37.650" style="s2">of them and they&#39;re all they&#39;re attached</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.520" end="01:21:38.970" style="s2">to these disciplines so I mean I look at</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.650" end="01:21:40.710" style="s2">this stuff and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.970" end="01:21:42.390" style="s2">to me because you&#39;re describing quite a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.710" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">beautiful process right giving someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.390" end="01:21:46.380" style="s2">the tools from from which they can leave</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:48.180" style="s2">the school and then create something of</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.380" end="01:21:50.400" style="s2">their life well but it&#39;s giving someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.180" end="01:21:51.780" style="s2">the weapons they can use to ruin their</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.400" end="01:21:54.260" style="s2">life for themselves is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.780" end="01:21:56.430" style="s2">on the other end that&#39;s it it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.260" end="01:21:59.750" style="s2">educational equivalent of cutting yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.430" end="01:22:02.700" style="s2">you know right like they&#39;re being given</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.750" end="01:22:05.880" style="s2">sharp tools and taught how to injure</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.700" end="01:22:07.850" style="s2">themselves the other thing is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.880" end="01:22:10.790" style="s2">just beautiful when the students leave</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.850" end="01:22:13.980" style="s2">right armed with these really powerful</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.790" end="01:22:15.870" style="s2">analytical tools it&#39;s beautiful once the</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.980" end="01:22:18.570" style="s2">students understand what it is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.870" end="01:22:20.760" style="s2">they&#39;re doing yeah right so this was the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.570" end="01:22:22.440" style="s2">thing the reason that that Heather and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.760" end="01:22:24.270" style="s2">my students got accused of being in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.440" end="01:22:26.430" style="s2">cult was that they came back from class</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.270" end="01:22:27.990" style="s2">very energized by what we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.430" end="01:22:29.790" style="s2">about they didn&#39;t necessarily agree yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.990" end="01:22:31.950" style="s2">they wanted to talk about it outside of</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.790" end="01:22:33.810" style="s2">class it had a life I felt that I felt</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.950" end="01:22:35.490" style="s2">that around to you with hung and a</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.810" end="01:22:36.960" style="s2">couple times and I felt that around you</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.490" end="01:22:38.130" style="s2">and Heather you see some magic I haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:22:40.380" end="01:22:43.440" style="s2">comes when someone loves something it</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.000" end="01:22:46.080" style="s2">comes out of them all right well and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:47.460" style="s2">it&#39;s such a joy you know here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.080" end="01:22:50.550" style="s2">thing once I got good I didn&#39;t mean I</p>

<p begin="01:22:52.050" end="01:22:53.970" style="s2">deep end</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.590" end="01:22:56.130" style="s2">yeah and literally what happened to me</p>

<p begin="01:22:59.490" end="01:23:03.540" style="s2">anything yeah I definitely yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.280" end="01:23:08.310" style="s2">she looked at me and we&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.540" end="01:23:11.640" style="s2">we&#39;ll find out you know but they right</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.310" end="01:23:14.790" style="s2">so they they literally said right a</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.640" end="01:23:16.500" style="s2">course description for us to put in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.790" end="01:23:18.060" style="s2">course catalog and wrote the craziest</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.500" end="01:23:20.100" style="s2">thing I can come up with I wrote it I</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.060" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">wrote what I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.100" end="01:23:23.790" style="s2">yeah and it was it was that it was a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:26.670" style="s2">course called adaptation and evolution</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.790" end="01:23:28.260" style="s2">of organisms mechanisms and ideas yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.670" end="01:23:29.910" style="s2">and the idea was that these three things</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.260" end="01:23:33.270" style="s2">evolve in a parallel but not identical</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.910" end="01:23:36.120" style="s2">way yeah let&#39;s explore that and I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.270" end="01:23:37.630" style="s2">you know an abstract to this thing it</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.120" end="01:23:39.040" style="s2">was just like I know they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.630" end="01:23:40.090" style="s2">activist but maybe they&#39;ll love ya</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.040" end="01:23:42.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a starting point they were like</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.090" end="01:23:44.130" style="s2">good do it yeah right and then I had a</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.460" end="01:23:46.720" style="s2">bunch of students walk through the door</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.130" end="01:23:48.850" style="s2">and they were ready to play yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.720" end="01:23:50.590" style="s2">good class right something about that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.850" end="01:23:52.690" style="s2">description caused the right people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.590" end="01:23:57.400" style="s2">really and then it was just like so much</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.690" end="01:23:59.560" style="s2">fun to walk in and see how far we could</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.400" end="01:24:03.100" style="s2">move in in a you know a three hour</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.560" end="01:24:05.980" style="s2">period or whatever but anyway after 14</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.100" end="01:24:07.720" style="s2">years of this this became quite</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.980" end="01:24:09.940" style="s2">efficient yeah right it was a question</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.720" end="01:24:11.710" style="s2">of there was a landscape we had to</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.940" end="01:24:13.180" style="s2">explore it there&#39;s actually not an order</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.710" end="01:24:15.070" style="s2">that we have to explore it in it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.180" end="01:24:17.140" style="s2">linear presentation the way you might do</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.070" end="01:24:19.390" style="s2">chemistry chemistry or something it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.140" end="01:24:22.660" style="s2">like it was more like walking into a</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.390" end="01:24:24.070" style="s2">forest with students and saying let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.660" end="01:24:27.970" style="s2">look at this over here you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.070" end="01:24:30.190" style="s2">what these guys are doing so anyway that</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.970" end="01:24:33.460" style="s2">thing once you get a community of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.190" end="01:24:35.470" style="s2">who a there&#39;s always somebody in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.460" end="01:24:36.940" style="s2">room who&#39;s ready to play you know back</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.470" end="01:24:38.740" style="s2">and forth with the professor you say</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.940" end="01:24:40.510" style="s2">something paradoxical they say but what</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.740" end="01:24:43.210" style="s2">about this and you say ah but what about</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.510" end="01:24:44.680" style="s2">that and then once you know once the</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.210" end="01:24:47.470" style="s2">others in the room begin to get the idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.680" end="01:24:49.750" style="s2">a that they are safe yeah that they can</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.470" end="01:24:51.220" style="s2">explore that it doesn&#39;t fall apart that</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.750" end="01:24:53.470" style="s2">if they&#39;re wrong publicly it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.220" end="01:24:54.940" style="s2">disaster that they end up looking smart</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.470" end="01:24:56.680" style="s2">in the end because they do come up with</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.940" end="01:24:57.940" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s novel sometimes they come</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.680" end="01:25:00.820" style="s2">up with stuff the professor doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.940" end="01:25:05.410" style="s2">know right it&#39;s sort of addictive hmm</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.820" end="01:25:08.830" style="s2">and anyway that thing unfolding inside</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.410" end="01:25:10.960" style="s2">the classroom was very threatening to</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.830" end="01:25:13.030" style="s2">the things unfolding in other classroom</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.960" end="01:25:15.460" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s so complex what happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.030" end="01:25:16.990" style="s2">there I it&#39;s the gravity of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.460" end="01:25:19.720" style="s2">Evergreen story because it speaks about</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.990" end="01:25:22.150" style="s2">so many different things yeah there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.720" end="01:25:24.330" style="s2">many different threads and this I I can</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.150" end="01:25:26.620" style="s2">see your own benjamín voice you just</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.330" end="01:25:29.410" style="s2">what is it two years down the track now</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.620" end="01:25:32.680" style="s2">he&#39;s still talking about it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.410" end="01:25:33.970" style="s2">tangling it and and yeah it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.680" end="01:25:35.650" style="s2">there&#39;s something about what happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.970" end="01:25:37.960" style="s2">there this is the layers the layers that</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.650" end="01:25:40.090" style="s2">are in there well I&#39;m so going right</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.960" end="01:25:42.130" style="s2">because there&#39;s some so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.090" end="01:25:44.770" style="s2">coming together series that I looked</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.130" end="01:25:46.090" style="s2">into and thought this is like clearly an</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.770" end="01:25:46.540" style="s2">insight into what the hell&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.090" end="01:25:47.950" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.540" end="01:25:49.270" style="s2">they&#39;ve doubled down on that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.950" end="01:25:49.590" style="s2">doing another I don&#39;t know if you saw</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.270" end="01:25:52.260" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.590" end="01:25:54.750" style="s2">recently but ya know I another coming</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.260" end="01:25:57.540" style="s2">together tearing apart series circuits I</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.750" end="01:26:00.030" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how their convictions</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.540" end="01:26:01.590" style="s2">grow stronger as the evidence that they</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.030" end="01:26:04.830" style="s2">are on the wrong track also grow</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.590" end="01:26:06.840" style="s2">stronger you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the hard</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.830" end="01:26:09.889" style="s2">part is at what point you get shaken out</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.840" end="01:26:12.900" style="s2">of that moral community you know yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.889" end="01:26:14.489" style="s2">it&#39;s stunning I mean I it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.900" end="01:26:16.530" style="s2">worrying like it&#39;s I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.489" end="01:26:18.960" style="s2">something particularly strange about the</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.530" end="01:26:22.770" style="s2">Washington area because I think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.960" end="01:26:24.869" style="s2">Puget Sound there&#39;s a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.770" end="01:26:26.040" style="s2">roads lead back there within the</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.869" end="01:26:28.469" style="s2">scholarship and all these strange things</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.040" end="01:26:33.960" style="s2">that I see so I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.469" end="01:26:36.420" style="s2">something particularly skewed within</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.960" end="01:26:38.400" style="s2">this this Washington area that some that</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.420" end="01:26:41.040" style="s2">Evergreen is do you have any insights</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.400" end="01:26:42.960" style="s2">into into that that&#39;s in it this is pure</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.040" end="01:26:44.400" style="s2">observation and I&#39;m wondering if there</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.960" end="01:26:45.960" style="s2">if these connect if these dots</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.400" end="01:26:48.300" style="s2">connecting something in some strange way</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.960" end="01:26:50.760" style="s2">well it&#39;d be very interesting if they</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.300" end="01:26:53.460" style="s2">were you raise the issue of the schools</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.760" end="01:26:56.730" style="s2">of IDI which Lyle Asher who&#39;s here yes a</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.460" end="01:26:58.230" style="s2">short lens we has been talking about so</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.730" end="01:27:00.119" style="s2">we should explore that I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.230" end="01:27:02.040" style="s2">that&#39;s connected to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.119" end="01:27:07.170" style="s2">what is it that you see in the Puget</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.040" end="01:27:09.690" style="s2">Sound area I mean you know the tenants</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.170" end="01:27:14.429" style="s2">that they were talking about at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.690" end="01:27:16.380" style="s2">start of several meetings that are</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.429" end="01:27:18.510" style="s2">because I&#39;m monitoring this through</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.380" end="01:27:21.590" style="s2">anything I can YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.510" end="01:27:24.150" style="s2">scholarship yeah um some writings and</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.590" end="01:27:27.330" style="s2">what is that race and pedagogy they have</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.150" end="01:27:30.030" style="s2">conferences there D&#39;Angelo&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.330" end="01:27:32.790" style="s2">player there and a lot it seems as</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.030" end="01:27:35.330" style="s2">though there&#39;s another militant answer</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.790" end="01:27:37.560" style="s2">for person that was teaching there</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.330" end="01:27:38.940" style="s2">there&#39;s been three or four other things</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.560" end="01:27:41.250" style="s2">where I&#39;ve just seen the logo on</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.940" end="01:27:42.659" style="s2">something like insane that I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.250" end="01:27:46.050" style="s2">like I&#39;ve gone wow this is too insane</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.659" end="01:27:48.210" style="s2">cuz usually they have to have to sell it</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.050" end="01:27:49.889" style="s2">right like a the Celt like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.210" end="01:27:52.650" style="s2">insane version of it yeah but they still</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.889" end="01:27:55.230" style="s2">have to sell it within to make it work</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.650" end="01:27:57.780" style="s2">within the academic university structure</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.230" end="01:27:58.710" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s hidden and usually you</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.780" end="01:28:00.270" style="s2">can tell when you&#39;re reading something</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.710" end="01:28:02.250" style="s2">hidden but then occasionally you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.270" end="01:28:05.190" style="s2">this thing is like it&#39;s bit</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.250" end="01:28:07.680" style="s2">yeah and a few of them have led back to</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.190" end="01:28:10.470" style="s2">that that applies so then I think what</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.680" end="01:28:12.960" style="s2">it is it so I was thrown a little bit by</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.470" end="01:28:19.020" style="s2">your question because it&#39;s like well the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.960" end="01:28:24.750" style="s2">level of rainfall but I think the fact</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.020" end="01:28:27.240" style="s2">is that but I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.750" end="01:28:32.490" style="s2">describing is that there&#39;s a critical</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.240" end="01:28:35.730" style="s2">mass necessary to do the ideal honor</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.490" end="01:28:37.980" style="s2">yeah and so the idea laundering doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.730" end="01:28:41.670" style="s2">show up in full force unless you have</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.980" end="01:28:43.320" style="s2">enough you know mirrors to bounce the</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.670" end="01:28:45.390" style="s2">laser off yeah at which points hey guys</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.320" end="01:28:46.710" style="s2">the coast is clear let&#39;s get weird right</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.390" end="01:28:49.320" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.710" end="01:28:51.960" style="s2">so it may be that there happens to be a</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.320" end="01:28:57.750" style="s2">concentration of particular things that</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.960" end="01:29:01.680" style="s2">allow a ill-formed conception hmm to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.750" end="01:29:04.470" style="s2">make it into daylight here yet just</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.680" end="01:29:09.930" style="s2">maybe for accidental reasons or</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.470" end="01:29:12.570" style="s2">arbitrary ones well and I mean I get a</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.930" end="01:29:14.430" style="s2">sense here in in Portland it&#39;s very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.570" end="01:29:16.740" style="s2">very left already so something was going</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.430" end="01:29:24.840" style="s2">to bubble up like he did wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.740" end="01:29:26.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get a bunch of I mean do these</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.840" end="01:29:29.250" style="s2">areas are they are they predominantly</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.690" end="01:29:32.120" style="s2">left-wing are these kind of this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.250" end="01:29:35.670" style="s2">definitely not swing states right</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.120" end="01:29:39.090" style="s2">something about he there&#39;s this weird</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.670" end="01:29:40.530" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve had with I mean I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.090" end="01:29:42.960" style="s2">call them friends it was it was an odd</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.530" end="01:29:48.540" style="s2">situation so I grew up in Australia and</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.960" end="01:29:49.770" style="s2">I did a lot of work a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.540" end="01:29:51.690" style="s2">works factory jobs and things like that</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.770" end="01:29:53.400" style="s2">and I remember moving to w.a and there</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.690" end="01:29:54.810" style="s2">was these conversations with some people</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.400" end="01:29:56.460" style="s2">that I was working with landscaping</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.810" end="01:29:59.390" style="s2">there without talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.460" end="01:30:02.550" style="s2">Aboriginal community and it was this</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.390" end="01:30:05.460" style="s2">strange experience of them being quite</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.550" end="01:30:06.870" style="s2">racist but like openly racist and I was</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.460" end="01:30:08.820" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t I still wanted to be their</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.870" end="01:30:11.190" style="s2">friends so to work with them yeah but I</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.820" end="01:30:12.960" style="s2">did want to call them out and then it</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.190" end="01:30:14.020" style="s2">was it was this odd experience of what</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.960" end="01:30:16.840" style="s2">do I let that go</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.020" end="01:30:18.100" style="s2">become the outcast right and I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.840" end="01:30:20.710" style="s2">going to work with this for long so hang</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.100" end="01:30:22.240" style="s2">on whatever hole whatever I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.710" end="01:30:23.470" style="s2">leave I&#39;ll leave that go just to keep</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.240" end="01:30:27.670" style="s2">the peace and move on I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.470" end="01:30:29.530" style="s2">change the way of thinking and so that</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.670" end="01:30:32.170" style="s2">experience I mean that&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.530" end="01:30:34.180" style="s2">stuck with me and then coming over here</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.170" end="01:30:37.840" style="s2">to Portland I had the same experience</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.180" end="01:30:40.510" style="s2">but they were talking about white men it</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.840" end="01:30:41.530" style="s2">was so weird so I was sitting there I</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.510" end="01:30:44.740" style="s2">was sitting there and they&#39;re going on</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.530" end="01:30:47.110" style="s2">speaking about white men like with hate</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.740" end="01:30:49.360" style="s2">and it was like yeah these these white</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.110" end="01:30:50.920" style="s2">guys I&#39;m dating they&#39;re the terrible oh</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.360" end="01:30:52.840" style="s2">god I hate them they all they do is play</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.920" end="01:30:55.360" style="s2">video again just so useless and then oh</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.840" end="01:30:58.690" style="s2">you&#39;re this wall like this cartoon</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.360" end="01:30:59.650" style="s2">figure of what a white man is and there</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.690" end="01:31:00.910" style="s2">was no really they could have been</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.650" end="01:31:02.230" style="s2">talking about specific people without</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.910" end="01:31:03.460" style="s2">talking generally and I&#39;m sitting there</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.230" end="01:31:05.440" style="s2">going I want to be friends of these guys</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.460" end="01:31:07.450" style="s2">but this is a fuck conversation like</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.440" end="01:31:08.890" style="s2">this is it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.450" end="01:31:11.320" style="s2">same thing different in well I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.890" end="01:31:12.970" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting at is super</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.320" end="01:31:15.460" style="s2">important and the parallel is a really</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.970" end="01:31:17.710" style="s2">interesting one in some sense human</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.460" end="01:31:19.480" style="s2">beings have a mode yeah when we are</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.710" end="01:31:21.010" style="s2">competing lineage against lineage we</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.480" end="01:31:23.800" style="s2">have a mode there are certain ways we</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.010" end="01:31:27.370" style="s2">sound when we are for example about to</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.800" end="01:31:28.480" style="s2">make war on some other group right when</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.370" end="01:31:30.610" style="s2">you&#39;re about to make war on some of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.480" end="01:31:32.680" style="s2">group you dehumanize them write stories</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.610" end="01:31:33.640" style="s2">in Hutus they said a cockroach a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.680" end="01:31:35.590" style="s2">the time side of cool and cockroaches</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.640" end="01:31:37.620" style="s2">Evergreen State College the police</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.590" end="01:31:40.510" style="s2">officer that calling a cockroach totally</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.620" end="01:31:43.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of making somebody out</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.510" end="01:31:45.550" style="s2">to be subhuman yeah vermin pathogen</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.000" end="01:31:49.780" style="s2">comes up a lot and we are watching this</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.550" end="01:31:52.960" style="s2">unfold in Western civilization we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.780" end="01:31:55.060" style="s2">certain it&#39;s clearer how it happens in</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.960" end="01:31:57.790" style="s2">the university because some part of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.060" end="01:31:59.230" style="s2">university culture is about saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.790" end="01:32:02.530" style="s2">things publicly about bringing ideas</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.230" end="01:32:05.020" style="s2">into the light and so we see it there</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.530" end="01:32:07.510" style="s2">more clearly we were talking a little</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.020" end="01:32:09.460" style="s2">bit about Lyle Asher who has unearthed</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.510" end="01:32:12.760" style="s2">another thread that is much harder to</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.460" end="01:32:16.630" style="s2">see and in fact when I first read his</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.760" end="01:32:19.390" style="s2">work my thought was this is really</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.630" end="01:32:21.010" style="s2">important and I would have missed it had</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.390" end="01:32:23.730" style="s2">he not done this work I was only just</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.010" end="01:32:27.180" style="s2">coven he just collided with his book so</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.730" end="01:32:28.770" style="s2">you want to say what what he&#39;s told</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.180" end="01:32:31.550" style="s2">I just want to kind of map out what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.770" end="01:32:34.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing now cuz so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.550" end="01:32:37.170" style="s2">lucky enough to watch a book come</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.170" end="01:32:40.770" style="s2">together that&#39;s coming out with within</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.170" end="01:32:44.910" style="s2">the next few months why Helen placards</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.770" end="01:32:48.300" style="s2">and James Lindsay so Helens 910 years</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.910" end="01:32:51.000" style="s2">deep into looking at this this cannon I</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.300" end="01:32:52.500" style="s2">guess specifically the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.000" end="01:32:56.100" style="s2">scholarship there&#39;s social justice</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.500" end="01:32:58.800" style="s2">scholarship and so her and Jim and a</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.100" end="01:33:00.540" style="s2">little bit of contribution from me over</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.800" end="01:33:04.680" style="s2">the course of the past two years has</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.540" end="01:33:08.640" style="s2">they&#39;ve mapped out the idea space and it</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.680" end="01:33:10.770" style="s2">was clear to me we kept running into the</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.640" end="01:33:13.440" style="s2">schools of Education and pedagogy</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.770" end="01:33:17.010" style="s2">pedagogy is a big thing so the theory of</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.440" end="01:33:18.810" style="s2">teaching and that kept popping up and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.010" end="01:33:20.340" style="s2">they&#39;ve they&#39;ve created this map in</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.810" end="01:33:21.750" style="s2">cynical theories it&#39;s mapped it out and</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.340" end="01:33:24.420" style="s2">I think it could potentially be a big</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.750" end="01:33:26.460" style="s2">event in mmm figuring out where this</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.420" end="01:33:28.950" style="s2">problem is actually stemming from but</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.460" end="01:33:30.240" style="s2">there&#39;s this big black hole because we</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.950" end="01:33:32.190" style="s2">keep running into this thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.240" end="01:33:33.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked into properly and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.190" end="01:33:35.520" style="s2">all of a sudden this week I shot with</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.570" end="01:33:36.900" style="s2">Lyle Asher as part of the film and we</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.520" end="01:33:39.140" style="s2">got to talking and then I went to look</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.900" end="01:33:43.590" style="s2">at his work and so he has mapped out</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.140" end="01:33:47.280" style="s2">that the schools of Education and how</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.590" end="01:33:48.630" style="s2">this kind of spread through these the</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.280" end="01:33:52.560" style="s2">low standards within the School of</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.630" end="01:33:55.140" style="s2">Education and they have moved from these</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.560" end="01:33:57.330" style="s2">I guess there were weak bodies right</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.140" end="01:34:00.540" style="s2">there were kind of a weak body that that</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.330" end="01:34:02.820" style="s2">some kind of disease started operating</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.540" end="01:34:04.680" style="s2">yeah their immune compromised yes</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.820" end="01:34:09.540" style="s2">compromised that was quite weak right</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.680" end="01:34:11.430" style="s2">now for a lot of reasons we&#39;ve got taken</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.540" end="01:34:13.410" style="s2">over ideologically and then they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.430" end="01:34:15.570" style="s2">moved an administrator class that have</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.410" end="01:34:17.790" style="s2">become educators so they&#39;ve gone back</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.570" end="01:34:19.410" style="s2">from administrative in back into the</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.790" end="01:34:22.500" style="s2">education thing so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.410" end="01:34:24.030" style="s2">mapping so there&#39;s these this is cannon</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.500" end="01:34:25.430" style="s2">and ideas and then how its actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.030" end="01:34:30.120" style="s2">operating in the real world and I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.430" end="01:34:31.110" style="s2">Lyle might be well I&#39;m definitely gonna</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.120" end="01:34:33.030" style="s2">keep in touch with him put it that way</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.110" end="01:34:34.710" style="s2">oh yeah know his stuff is is</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.030" end="01:34:37.260" style="s2">mind-blowing so the studying of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.710" end="01:34:38.550" style="s2">schools of IDI it&#39;s you know most of us</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.260" end="01:34:39.910" style="s2">don&#39;t even think about schools of at</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.550" end="01:34:41.800" style="s2">half and has it come up in</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.910" end="01:34:43.930" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about how civilization</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.800" end="01:34:46.000" style="s2">works but it has its a because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.930" end="01:34:49.530" style="s2">weak node and because so much comes from</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.000" end="01:34:54.180" style="s2">it it&#39;s a very dangerous vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.530" end="01:34:57.490" style="s2">but the thing I&#39;m grappling with is</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.180" end="01:35:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction between what the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.490" end="01:35:05.320" style="s2">movement says that it thinks and what</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.520" end="01:35:10.720" style="s2">how it works and the thing that concerns</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.320" end="01:35:13.870" style="s2">me most is that the only way that this</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.720" end="01:35:16.090" style="s2">movement delivers something positive to</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.870" end="01:35:18.970" style="s2">those who have signed up for it in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.090" end="01:35:22.600" style="s2">end is through some sort of very</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.970" end="01:35:25.030" style="s2">frightening Maoist mmm takeover in which</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.600" end="01:35:29.350" style="s2">it actually has the power to reallocate</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.030" end="01:35:31.860" style="s2">resources on a massive scale I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.350" end="01:35:34.690" style="s2">that as very likely it does</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.860" end="01:35:36.520" style="s2">organizationally so within a certain</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.690" end="01:35:40.080" style="s2">organization if you get enough it will</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.520" end="01:35:44.080" style="s2">buy in you can advance using your</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.080" end="01:35:46.030" style="s2">oppression variables quite beyond what</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.080" end="01:35:47.470" style="s2">you deserve to advance or it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.030" end="01:35:49.000" style="s2">easy path I mean there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.470" end="01:35:51.580" style="s2">competition around in all these places</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.000" end="01:35:53.800" style="s2">now and it&#39;s like this extra element of</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.580" end="01:35:55.930" style="s2">competition that you can kind of ride so</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.800" end="01:35:57.550" style="s2">this is this is where I was heading</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.930" end="01:35:59.140" style="s2">maybe I shouldn&#39;t say the only way it</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.550" end="01:36:00.550" style="s2">delivers right you were heading the only</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.140" end="01:36:04.030" style="s2">way it delivers in a fashion that</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.550" end="01:36:06.850" style="s2">matches what it advertised yes is some</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.030" end="01:36:10.510" style="s2">sort of a Maoist I take over yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.850" end="01:36:13.810" style="s2">yeah what it actually amounts to is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.510" end="01:36:15.670" style="s2">kind of affirmative action at every</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.810" end="01:36:17.710" style="s2">scale which I have to tell you game</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.670" end="01:36:20.110" style="s2">theoretically is a non-starter</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.710" end="01:36:22.510" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying affirmative action can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.110" end="01:36:23.680" style="s2">work although I think what we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.510" end="01:36:25.600" style="s2">through the affirmative action</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.680" end="01:36:31.950" style="s2">experiment is that the Devils in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.600" end="01:36:36.540" style="s2">details yeah but the idea that every</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.950" end="01:36:39.580" style="s2">classroom is an opportunity to adjust</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.540" end="01:36:41.530" style="s2">well-being by silencing certain people</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.580" end="01:36:44.560" style="s2">and elevating the voices of others that</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.530" end="01:36:49.320" style="s2">every courtroom might be a place I mean</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.560" end="01:36:52.660" style="s2">just a simple fact that what is a crime</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.320" end="01:36:55.300" style="s2">may be shifted so that</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.660" end="01:36:57.520" style="s2">some people have more leeway to commit</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.300" end="01:37:01.110" style="s2">crimes and other people have less leeway</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.520" end="01:37:03.940" style="s2">to commit crimes now on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.110" end="01:37:06.550" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s been a racist court</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.940" end="01:37:08.730" style="s2">system that&#39;s the justification for the</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.550" end="01:37:11.620" style="s2">new caste system which is a reverse of</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.730" end="01:37:13.380" style="s2">yeah and in some senses it has been you</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.620" end="01:37:15.460" style="s2">know I mean II that&#39;s it&#39;s more it</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.380" end="01:37:19.390" style="s2">hasn&#39;t it hasn&#39;t right when it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.460" end="01:37:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s working well it doesn&#39;t well it was</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.390" end="01:37:23.530" style="s2">hard for me isn&#39;t a stress these things</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.760" end="01:37:25.360" style="s2">are off right right well I want to</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.530" end="01:37:29.200" style="s2">actually about that from because I mean</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.360" end="01:37:31.240" style="s2">as you must be aware Australia is</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.200" end="01:37:33.370" style="s2">something of which Americans are well</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.240" end="01:37:40.350" style="s2">aware and simultaneously not aware at</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.370" end="01:37:44.920" style="s2">all but the fact just just take a an</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.350" end="01:37:46.540" style="s2">ugly example up until very recently it</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.920" end="01:37:49.360" style="s2">would have been almost impossible in an</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.540" end="01:37:53.490" style="s2">American Court for a black woman to</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.360" end="01:37:56.890" style="s2">successfully charge a white man with</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.490" end="01:38:00.070" style="s2">sexual assault right so in effect white</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.890" end="01:38:05.050" style="s2">men have had the ability to rape black</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.070" end="01:38:12.820" style="s2">women in the US and not have the courts</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.050" end="01:38:14.800" style="s2">step in is that I have no idea but it is</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.820" end="01:38:18.000" style="s2">so inconceivable as an American is so</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.800" end="01:38:21.100" style="s2">inconceivable that you know prior to</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.000" end="01:38:23.080" style="s2">1950 that such a court kids that if a</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.100" end="01:38:25.600" style="s2">white man had raped a black yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.080" end="01:38:29.340" style="s2">that she would end up getting her day in</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.600" end="01:38:32.350" style="s2">court and the court would hear this as a</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.340" end="01:38:35.290" style="s2">legitimate accusation it&#39;s horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.350" end="01:38:36.790" style="s2">yeah like that bitch really hurt me and</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.290" end="01:38:38.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think that&#39;s all I know and</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.790" end="01:38:42.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of energy there to play</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.680" end="01:38:44.170" style="s2">with but yeah that&#39;s but you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.010" end="01:38:46.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll be curious when this</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.170" end="01:38:49.420" style="s2">podcast emerges if anybody thinks I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.510" end="01:38:51.310" style="s2">wrong yeah about this but know that</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.420" end="01:38:52.980" style="s2">courts have been slanted and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.310" end="01:38:56.110" style="s2">been slanted in a way that&#39;s fallen on</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.980" end="01:38:58.810" style="s2">certain people&#39;s shoulders in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.110" end="01:39:01.870" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t fallen on others what happens</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.810" end="01:39:05.109" style="s2">if you say well it was like that for so</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.870" end="01:39:07.269" style="s2">and so many years we&#39;re now flipping</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.109" end="01:39:11.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna be the opposite way right</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.269" end="01:39:13.869" style="s2">a that is not going to be stable right</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.589" end="01:39:15.849" style="s2">and that is not to say that what</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.869" end="01:39:17.800" style="s2">happened was in any way acceptable it</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.849" end="01:39:21.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t but you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.800" end="01:39:25.239" style="s2">destroying civilization by naively</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.760" end="01:39:30.539" style="s2">turning the tables on a historical fact</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.239" end="01:39:34.269" style="s2">and anyway it&#39;s a it is a lethal</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.539" end="01:39:38.079" style="s2">approach to solving this problem taking</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.269" end="01:39:39.789" style="s2">a classroom and allowing certain people</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.079" end="01:39:44.229" style="s2">to speak and other people not being able</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.789" end="01:39:46.359" style="s2">to speak is also it&#39;s the same thing but</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.229" end="01:39:50.760" style="s2">yeah but the weird thing is is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.359" end="01:39:54.159" style="s2">difference between something happening</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.760" end="01:39:56.559" style="s2">subconsciously or you know as a result</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.159" end="01:40:02.499" style="s2">of these forces that are underneath us</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.559" end="01:40:04.209" style="s2">and also the the system was aspiring not</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.499" end="01:40:06.969" style="s2">to be there so if something was</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.209" end="01:40:08.859" style="s2">happening it was happening implicitly</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.969" end="01:40:11.320" style="s2">through that and then if they do that</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.859" end="01:40:13.629" style="s2">xsplit explicitly so then they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.320" end="01:40:17.439" style="s2">just they&#39;re explicitly changing the</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.629" end="01:40:19.329" style="s2">system to be racist explicit explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.439" end="01:40:21.519" style="s2">as opposed to as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.329" end="01:40:23.289" style="s2">something that the the probably the</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.519" end="01:40:24.909" style="s2">problems would occur right but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.289" end="01:40:27.849" style="s2">not explicitly occurring they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.909" end="01:40:29.169" style="s2">embraced racism as a solution yes and</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.849" end="01:40:31.119" style="s2">they&#39;ve defined it out of it as one</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.169" end="01:40:33.909" style="s2">critical race theory right the whole the</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.119" end="01:40:36.550" style="s2">whole game that&#39;s what it is and so for</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.909" end="01:40:40.659" style="s2">some of us this is absolutely jarring</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.550" end="01:40:43.689" style="s2">because as much as I agree that there is</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.659" end="01:40:46.739" style="s2">more unfairness than the system</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.689" end="01:40:50.619" style="s2">acknowledges more remaining unfairness</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.739" end="01:40:54.039" style="s2">the idea of abandoning the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.619" end="01:40:58.300" style="s2">fairness in favor of some compensatory</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.039" end="01:41:04.510" style="s2">kind of racism is it&#39;s obscene it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.300" end="01:41:07.989" style="s2">obscene and it it robs this of any</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.510" end="01:41:10.749" style="s2">legitimate mm-hmm so anyway I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.989" end="01:41:14.409" style="s2">where where we end up with it but just</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.749" end="01:41:16.749" style="s2">the simple recognition that if you stop</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.409" end="01:41:18.219" style="s2">listening to what it says yeah and you</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.749" end="01:41:19.780" style="s2">look at what it actually pursue</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.219" end="01:41:21.730" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s doing is its timing it</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.780" end="01:41:23.530" style="s2">is it&#39;s saying that when you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.730" end="01:41:24.760" style="s2">if you look carefully at the cannon you</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.530" end="01:41:26.110" style="s2">look carefully you can see and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.760" end="01:41:28.900" style="s2">it&#39;s really really hard like I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.110" end="01:41:31.420" style="s2">even problems with talking to my sisters</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.900" end="01:41:35.410" style="s2">about this stuff either from the outside</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.420" end="01:41:36.670" style="s2">it looks like I&#39;m getting drawn into the</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.410" end="01:41:38.800" style="s2">role right or something like yeah dad</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.670" end="01:41:40.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and remember you being</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.800" end="01:41:42.160" style="s2">that gun like I&#39;m not that guy you have</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.480" end="01:41:44.020" style="s2">to see what I crazy it&#39;s so ugly</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.160" end="01:41:46.330" style="s2">underneath this earth have to look past</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.020" end="01:41:49.300" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like sanitation to bring</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.330" end="01:41:51.730" style="s2">someone up to speed luckily I&#39;ve family</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.300" end="01:41:53.739" style="s2">right there so I&#39;ve got that ability to</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.730" end="01:41:55.449" style="s2">sit with them for a long time and tell</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.739" end="01:41:58.570" style="s2">them why I&#39;m not a monster but most</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.449" end="01:42:00.219" style="s2">people are a few doors of clothes back</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.570" end="01:42:01.780" style="s2">home in Australia as a result of me</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.219" end="01:42:05.530" style="s2">looking into this stuff well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.780" end="01:42:10.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing is that I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.530" end="01:42:14.199" style="s2">when people they can&#39;t hear you or when</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.690" end="01:42:16.690" style="s2">I try to convey why it is that we are</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.199" end="01:42:20.739" style="s2">not where people expect us to be based</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.690" end="01:42:26.680" style="s2">on the values that we hold we can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.739" end="01:42:28.780" style="s2">their answers too seriously because the</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.680" end="01:42:31.780" style="s2">thing that the movement that we are</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.780" end="01:42:34.840" style="s2">talking about does so effectively is</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.780" end="01:42:37.360" style="s2">change the incentives of individuals so</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.840" end="01:42:40.420" style="s2">that it is easier to go along than it is</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.360" end="01:42:42.880" style="s2">to resist you just drive the costs up to</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.420" end="01:42:45.489" style="s2">people who resist in any form so high</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.880" end="01:42:48.880" style="s2">that it takes very unusual people to</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.489" end="01:42:51.100" style="s2">choose to pay yeah and what happens then</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.880" end="01:42:55.300" style="s2">is people will rationalize what they are</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.100" end="01:42:56.050" style="s2">doing so if you&#39;re a coward right if</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.300" end="01:42:58.180" style="s2">you&#39;re a coward</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.050" end="01:43:00.280" style="s2">then you don&#39;t want to find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.180" end="01:43:01.719" style="s2">having to explain to your family why</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.280" end="01:43:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually in the all right</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.719" end="01:43:07.180" style="s2">yeah right yeah so maybe it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.000" end="01:43:09.580" style="s2">just embrace the platitudes and to do it</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.180" end="01:43:12.790" style="s2">enough virtru signaling that you are no</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.580" end="01:43:14.770" style="s2">longer suspect yeah and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.790" end="01:43:17.860" style="s2">imagining I don&#39;t know how other</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.770" end="01:43:20.469" style="s2">people&#39;s minds work but were I defined</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.860" end="01:43:22.449" style="s2">myself in that position which I would</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.469" end="01:43:25.210" style="s2">not allow myself to but if I were to</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.449" end="01:43:28.480" style="s2">find myself in that position the pain of</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.210" end="01:43:31.079" style="s2">having said what I didn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.480" end="01:43:33.659" style="s2">order to get myself out of trouble</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.079" end="01:43:35.400" style="s2">would be so great then it would be</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.659" end="01:43:37.679" style="s2">easier to rationalize it actually I do</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.400" end="01:43:40.050" style="s2">believe that yeah and so I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.679" end="01:43:42.420" style="s2">unfolding throughout the entire thing is</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.050" end="01:43:43.920" style="s2">that people are convincing themselves of</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.420" end="01:43:47.489" style="s2">positions that they would not ordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.920" end="01:43:48.960" style="s2">be compelled by because it is the only</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.489" end="01:43:50.489" style="s2">solution to the problem that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.960" end="01:43:51.780" style="s2">been given you do that long enough and</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.489" end="01:43:56.099" style="s2">you actually believe that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.780" end="01:43:57.179" style="s2">not there&#39;s no kind of process there you</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.099" end="01:43:59.760" style="s2">get so a lot of people don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.179" end="01:44:02.130" style="s2">they believe as well so they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.760" end="01:44:04.020" style="s2">they&#39;re in this they&#39;re kind of using</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.130" end="01:44:05.309" style="s2">their intuitions to go through a liberal</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.020" end="01:44:07.469" style="s2">unlike the left and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.309" end="01:44:09.059" style="s2">thing but if you actually bring it down</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.469" end="01:44:13.800" style="s2">you actually explore what what what it</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.059" end="01:44:14.940" style="s2">is you believe it&#39;s harder to shake or</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.800" end="01:44:17.190" style="s2">something like that like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.940" end="01:44:18.809" style="s2">people who are who aren&#39;t getting swept</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.190" end="01:44:23.670" style="s2">up in this things cuz I&#39;m I know what I</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.809" end="01:44:25.710" style="s2">believe oh I I know exactly you have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.670" end="01:44:27.090" style="s2">change a lot like it for some people for</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.710" end="01:44:28.949" style="s2">to buy into something they have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.090" end="01:44:31.230" style="s2">change a few little things yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.949" end="01:44:36.090" style="s2">like I actually you if you want me to</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.230" end="01:44:39.030" style="s2">join this enterprise which is a foot and</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.090" end="01:44:40.320" style="s2">everyone&#39;s back home wanted me to join</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.030" end="01:44:42.750" style="s2">it means I would have to change my</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.320" end="01:44:44.550" style="s2">understanding of human nature I would</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.750" end="01:44:47.369" style="s2">have to unchanged my understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.550" end="01:44:49.650" style="s2">what being a liberal is I would have to</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.369" end="01:44:51.210" style="s2">change and the damage I would do to</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.650" end="01:44:52.770" style="s2">myself for changing those things would</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.210" end="01:44:59.909" style="s2">be far worse than anything I can do to</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.770" end="01:45:01.530" style="s2">them so yeah so no it&#39;s the well I I get</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.909" end="01:45:03.329" style="s2">this completely and in fact the canoe</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.530" end="01:45:07.440" style="s2">meeting is the perfect example because</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.329" end="01:45:13.559" style="s2">you know as I&#39;m so I walked into that</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.440" end="01:45:15.599" style="s2">room and sat down in what socially felt</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.559" end="01:45:17.099" style="s2">like the seat to sit down in and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.599" end="01:45:19.290" style="s2">suddenly realized I was in front of</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.099" end="01:45:29.579" style="s2">these cameras right it&#39;s great for me</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.290" end="01:45:31.800" style="s2">yeah but what it meant was that I was</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.579" end="01:45:34.020" style="s2">standing there as we were all back in to</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.800" end="01:45:37.530" style="s2">enter the canoe and yeah sure off to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.020" end="01:45:41.139" style="s2">magical land of equity everybody filed</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.530" end="01:45:43.570" style="s2">past yeah and some of them will cachet</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.139" end="01:45:45.280" style="s2">they do the fact there are ones every</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.570" end="01:45:47.440" style="s2">time I see that a good there ones who I</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.280" end="01:45:49.179" style="s2">know were embarrassed of what they had</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.440" end="01:45:51.460" style="s2">that I found there was some people who</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.179" end="01:45:54.159" style="s2">you like a look out of the corner of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.460" end="01:45:55.869" style="s2">eye like oh they looked right at me they</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.159" end="01:45:57.909" style="s2">were my friends and they knew that this</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.869" end="01:45:59.290" style="s2">was wrong yeah and then yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.909" end="01:46:02.400" style="s2">they had to look me in the eye and see</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.290" end="01:46:07.330" style="s2">it and I look to the right exactly I</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.400" end="01:46:08.770" style="s2">mean I almost and I couldn&#39;t ride that</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.330" end="01:46:10.750" style="s2">like if I wrote that I&#39;d be really proud</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.770" end="01:46:12.940" style="s2">of myself that that&#39;s shot that once all</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.750" end="01:46:15.460" style="s2">right no it sounds like captured it it</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.940" end="01:46:19.150" style="s2">actually happened but the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.460" end="01:46:21.429" style="s2">what it sort of captures is that one</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.150" end="01:46:24.429" style="s2">option for me in that room technically</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.429" end="01:46:26.409" style="s2">mmm must abort their canoe yeah and the</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.429" end="01:46:29.230" style="s2">simple basis that equity is desirable</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.409" end="01:46:31.719" style="s2">and that yeah you know yada yada yada</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.230" end="01:46:33.190" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t a chance in the world that</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.719" end="01:46:34.900" style="s2">I was getting on their can that that</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.190" end="01:46:36.340" style="s2">says something about you like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.900" end="01:46:36.790" style="s2">beat it was a big move not to get on</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.340" end="01:46:38.110" style="s2">that camera</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.790" end="01:46:42.040" style="s2">you know what would have thought oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.110" end="01:46:45.070" style="s2">it was fated with Oh a bunch of I would</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.040" end="01:46:48.280" style="s2">have lashes anyway I would have walked</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.070" end="01:46:51.100" style="s2">on the tops of the seats to get out not</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.280" end="01:46:53.320" style="s2">to board their goddamn canoe yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.100" end="01:46:55.360" style="s2">you know I mean it&#39;s all in that room</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.320" end="01:46:57.400" style="s2">yeah got people who don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.360" end="01:46:59.530" style="s2">what&#39;s going yeah you&#39;ve got people like</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.400" end="01:47:01.239" style="s2">the ones you described who walked by me</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.530" end="01:47:03.580" style="s2">with shame in their eyes because they</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.239" end="01:47:06.219" style="s2">knew that we both knew what was going on</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.580" end="01:47:08.469" style="s2">yeah you got me who&#39;s like you know if</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.219" end="01:47:10.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a burrow out the wall yeah not</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.469" end="01:47:19.239" style="s2">getting on your can you go Benjamin</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.090" end="01:47:21.869" style="s2">Vaughn a camera magic the land of equity</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.239" end="01:47:27.159" style="s2">but the real question at some level is</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.869" end="01:47:29.469" style="s2">if we accept and I think you do that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.159" end="01:47:31.480" style="s2">movement says a bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.469" end="01:47:33.699" style="s2">don&#39;t add up it&#39;s internally consistent</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.480" end="01:47:36.310" style="s2">but they don&#39;t add up if you evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.699" end="01:47:38.350" style="s2">them from a grounded external</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.310" end="01:47:41.080" style="s2">perspective but that it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.350" end="01:47:43.330" style="s2">effective because it puts people in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.080" end="01:47:45.100" style="s2">bind and gives them one option to solve</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.330" end="01:47:48.330" style="s2">their problem and that one option</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.100" end="01:47:53.380" style="s2">involves embracing these wrong ideas</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.330" end="01:47:54.520" style="s2">what we who are not easily persuaded to</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.380" end="01:47:56.740" style="s2">join them</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.520" end="01:47:59.620" style="s2">our doing wrong is we are not</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.740" end="01:48:02.050" style="s2">understanding that it is our obligation</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.620" end="01:48:06.700" style="s2">to figure out how to honorably</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.050" end="01:48:07.840" style="s2">counteract that strategy and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.700" end="01:48:09.520" style="s2">maybe maybe you aren&#39;t maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.840" end="01:48:11.260" style="s2">speaking for myself and yeah maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.520" end="01:48:14.170" style="s2">are figuring it out maybe that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.260" end="01:48:15.580" style="s2">your fellows are looking at it we draw</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.170" end="01:48:18.460" style="s2">into it and I&#39;m spending a long time</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.580" end="01:48:21.340" style="s2">with this I mean Douglas Murray said</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.460" end="01:48:25.120" style="s2">this as well he he&#39;s written his book</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.340" end="01:48:26.350" style="s2">that&#39;s taken the battle to the gates of</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.120" end="01:48:27.790" style="s2">the university and I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.350" end="01:48:29.710" style="s2">cynical theories will take it right into</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.790" end="01:48:31.330" style="s2">the center now but he said himself like</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.710" end="01:48:33.610" style="s2">after you start looking at this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.330" end="01:48:34.660" style="s2">and you you can&#39;t stop it like you kind</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.610" end="01:48:37.510" style="s2">of get drawn into it cuz you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.660" end="01:48:39.640" style="s2">holy crap it is come it is completely</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.510" end="01:48:42.760" style="s2">different than the like iceberg tip</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.640" end="01:48:45.130" style="s2">right away that we get we get shown and</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.760" end="01:48:47.170" style="s2">it&#39;s I just think that it&#39;s I just go</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.130" end="01:48:49.660" style="s2">there and then be productive create art</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.170" end="01:48:51.760" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s probably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.660" end="01:48:54.880" style="s2">the only solution I know well gets me in</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.760" end="01:48:56.440" style="s2">a lot of trouble though so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.880" end="01:48:58.480" style="s2">how to operationalize what I think I</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.440" end="01:49:02.500" style="s2">know about this what I think I know is</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.480" end="01:49:04.240" style="s2">that there are always I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.500" end="01:49:08.320" style="s2">I&#39;m even topped here in this probably</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.240" end="01:49:12.250" style="s2">yeah but in terms of resisting this kind</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.320" end="01:49:14.050" style="s2">of thinking yeah you know I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.250" end="01:49:17.170" style="s2">start somewhere else my scientific work</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.050" end="01:49:19.450" style="s2">my scientific approach absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.170" end="01:49:21.480" style="s2">requires me not to be persuaded by the</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.450" end="01:49:24.040" style="s2">fact that absolutely everybody disagrees</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.480" end="01:49:26.110" style="s2">that&#39;s how you find new scientific stuff</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.040" end="01:49:27.940" style="s2">that matters if you&#39;re persuaded by the</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.110" end="01:49:31.060" style="s2">fact that everybody disagrees with you</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.940" end="01:49:32.440" style="s2">you cannot traverse new ground in</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.060" end="01:49:35.070" style="s2">science because everybody will disagree</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.440" end="01:49:38.380" style="s2">with you at the beginning right so my</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.070" end="01:49:40.150" style="s2">professional mode is born of that same</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.380" end="01:49:41.740" style="s2">instinct which is well it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.150" end="01:49:43.030" style="s2">that everybody disagrees with me but</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.740" end="01:49:45.280" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s even a sign that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.030" end="01:49:47.350" style="s2">onto is important well I think I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.280" end="01:49:49.060" style="s2">similar training in that well I think</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.350" end="01:49:51.610" style="s2">that everyone to like I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.060" end="01:49:53.260" style="s2">to explain my ideas mhm and every time I</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.610" end="01:49:54.970" style="s2">have everyone goes it&#39;s a stupid idea</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.260" end="01:49:56.590" style="s2">like the industry doesn&#39;t want to look</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.970" end="01:49:57.640" style="s2">after or whatever and then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.590" end="01:49:58.690" style="s2">sudden I went well you know what screw</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.640" end="01:50:01.090" style="s2">you guys I&#39;m gonna learn how to use a</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.690" end="01:50:02.440" style="s2">camera I&#39;m gonna edit and I&#39;d do it and</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.090" end="01:50:03.700" style="s2">then all this awesome and then the</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.440" end="01:50:04.610" style="s2">audience gets it and they go this is</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.700" end="01:50:06.380" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.610" end="01:50:08.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s like so it&#39;s a similar thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.380" end="01:50:11.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;ve kicked in the dick</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.540" end="01:50:15.350" style="s2">constantly and with with the middleman</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.900" end="01:50:16.730" style="s2">between what I want and so yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.350" end="01:50:18.739" style="s2">similar training right like it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.730" end="01:50:20.300" style="s2">not gonna produce that thing if you</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.739" end="01:50:22.280" style="s2">listen to everyone as they just have</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.300" end="01:50:25.369" style="s2">heard Casey Neistat say something very</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.280" end="01:50:27.469" style="s2">similar about why he chose the path that</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.369" end="01:50:29.630" style="s2">he did yeah right and this point is left</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.469" end="01:50:32.119" style="s2">the barriers to bringing out your own</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.630" end="01:50:32.690" style="s2">vision I have never been lower Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.119" end="01:50:34.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.690" end="01:50:36.949" style="s2">exactly Anna the industry is not Sun</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.760" end="01:50:40.730" style="s2">yeah you know anyway yeah the Internet</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.949" end="01:50:42.230" style="s2">is is both the reason why this thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.730" end="01:50:45.230" style="s2">spread but it&#39;s also they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.230" end="01:50:47.780" style="s2">the thing that kills it yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.230" end="01:50:48.920" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy to talk so I so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.780" end="01:50:50.840" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about solutions right</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.920" end="01:50:52.820" style="s2">yeah my solution is very much just I</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.840" end="01:50:54.170" style="s2">think it&#39;ll do its own work at people if</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.820" end="01:50:57.080" style="s2">you can show people what it actually is</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.170" end="01:50:59.389" style="s2">I have a it&#39;s a faith in that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.080" end="01:51:01.340" style="s2">maybe I could be no no I think it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.389" end="01:51:05.119" style="s2">of it yeah I think there&#39;s another part</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.340" end="01:51:06.590" style="s2">of it is what I was talking about they</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.119" end="01:51:08.510" style="s2">need to see what it is they have to have</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.590" end="01:51:10.219" style="s2">the ability to see what yeah everybody</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.510" end="01:51:12.020" style="s2">rules you need to draw lines around it</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.219" end="01:51:13.909" style="s2">so they can differentiate it from the</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.020" end="01:51:15.260" style="s2">civil rights movements and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.909" end="01:51:17.840" style="s2">intuitions that they have that are</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.260" end="01:51:21.280" style="s2">correct I think maybe three things</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.840" end="01:51:24.110" style="s2">necessary here believe it or not one is</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.280" end="01:51:26.000" style="s2">okay the screen which we were decrying</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.110" end="01:51:28.639" style="s2">at the beginning of this conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.000" end="01:51:31.219" style="s2">the key to something else yeah you need</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.639" end="01:51:34.369" style="s2">to see the canoe meeting on a screen</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.219" end="01:51:36.860" style="s2">without somebody sitting there with you</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.369" end="01:51:38.510" style="s2">judging you yeah right you need to be</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.860" end="01:51:42.739" style="s2">able to just and just see it and</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.510" end="01:51:43.280" style="s2">understand whoa that&#39;s a little that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.739" end="01:51:48.110" style="s2">little weird</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.280" end="01:51:51.920" style="s2">yeah right - you need examples of people</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.110" end="01:51:55.760" style="s2">who show you that you can resist this</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.920" end="01:51:58.219" style="s2">right I resisted people swore I was a</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.760" end="01:52:00.080" style="s2">conservative I swore I wasn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.219" end="01:52:01.250" style="s2">what a couple years later people have</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.080" end="01:52:03.469" style="s2">stopped telling me I&#39;m a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.250" end="01:52:05.060" style="s2">they&#39;ve gotten it so the point is do you</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.469" end="01:52:06.800" style="s2">have to join the Conservatives in order</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.060" end="01:52:08.570" style="s2">to reject this stuff no and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.800" end="01:52:10.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of just saying sorry</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.570" end="01:52:11.750" style="s2">that&#39;s not where I yeah I&#39;m friendly</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.310" end="01:52:12.800" style="s2">with conservatives but I haven&#39;t joined</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.750" end="01:52:15.369" style="s2">them because I still think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.800" end="01:52:17.820" style="s2">problems that need to be addressed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.369" end="01:52:20.949" style="s2">yada yada yada but anyway human is a</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.820" end="01:52:24.369" style="s2">helen pluck rose yeah anyone interested</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.949" end="01:52:26.619" style="s2">in rosetta stone to be left-wing in this</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.369" end="01:52:28.300" style="s2">current climate totally she&#39;s it oh</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.619" end="01:52:33.369" style="s2">she&#39;s marvelous in so many different</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.300" end="01:52:36.480" style="s2">ways but the so you need examples of</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.369" end="01:52:39.610" style="s2">what it would look like to stand your</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.480" end="01:52:41.800" style="s2">your philosophical ground in the face of</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.610" end="01:52:43.780" style="s2">this you need the ability to see what it</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.800" end="01:52:45.250" style="s2">looks like if you don&#39;t yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.780" end="01:52:46.630" style="s2">who are you gonna be in that room are</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.250" end="01:52:48.040" style="s2">you gonna be the people cheering the</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.630" end="01:52:50.830" style="s2">canoe or you&#39;re gonna be the embarrassed</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.040" end="01:52:52.150" style="s2">people you know participating because</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.830" end="01:52:53.590" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what else to do and mind</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.150" end="01:52:56.250" style="s2">you I should say in the defense of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.590" end="01:52:59.830" style="s2">people who walked by me in that room</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.250" end="01:53:01.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not a fair comparison because I was</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.830" end="01:53:03.849" style="s2">a tenured professor yeah they were staff</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.900" end="01:53:06.429" style="s2">I totally understand why you would jump</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.849" end="01:53:10.150" style="s2">on yeah I I don&#39;t even know if I</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.429" end="01:53:13.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t just jump on the canoe just to</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.150" end="01:53:14.560" style="s2">just to not it&#39;s you know mean well</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.000" end="01:53:18.610" style="s2">otherwise or something like that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.560" end="01:53:20.290" style="s2">I am like you in that I want to stand</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.610" end="01:53:21.880" style="s2">against these things but I mean it makes</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.290" end="01:53:23.380" style="s2">sense to her just jump on the back of</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.880" end="01:53:24.460" style="s2">history but you know like his well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.380" end="01:53:28.179" style="s2">certainly better than losing your job</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.460" end="01:53:30.880" style="s2">yeah and they hadn&#39;t had the information</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.179" end="01:53:33.250" style="s2">that you had as well no they they had</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.880" end="01:53:35.320" style="s2">but I mean again they were staff they</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.250" end="01:53:37.869" style="s2">were vulnerable in a way that I actually</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.320" end="01:53:39.610" style="s2">turned out to be vulnerable but but I</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.869" end="01:53:42.580" style="s2">was a lot less vulnerable as a as</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.610" end="01:53:47.110" style="s2">tenured faculty but in any case yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.580" end="01:53:49.659" style="s2">don&#39;t so a in 2019 I don&#39;t think Mike</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.110" end="01:53:55.590" style="s2">Dana jumps on that canoe because he has</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.659" end="01:53:55.590" style="s2">I know the canoe meeting yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.800" end="01:54:01.139" style="s2">but okay so let&#39;s say that there are</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.760" end="01:54:05.020" style="s2">three things going on here there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.139" end="01:54:06.760" style="s2">ability to with nobody pressuring you in</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.020" end="01:54:08.889" style="s2">the room evaluate what this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.760" end="01:54:10.840" style="s2">actually just objectively looks like on</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.889" end="01:54:14.170" style="s2">your screen that&#39;s one thing there are</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.840" end="01:54:16.989" style="s2">examples of what you can do other than</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.170" end="01:54:20.710" style="s2">hop on the canoe and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.989" end="01:54:23.260" style="s2">sort of ideal you discussion layer which</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.710" end="01:54:29.070" style="s2">is you know as you pointed out earlier</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.260" end="01:54:32.829" style="s2">in this conversation there is a a large</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.070" end="01:54:34.360" style="s2">population that are sort of interested</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.829" end="01:54:36.550" style="s2">in this discussion just as there is a</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.360" end="01:54:40.110" style="s2">large population looking for a movement</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.550" end="01:54:42.909" style="s2">to solve the difficult problems of</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.110" end="01:54:44.320" style="s2">existence yeah there&#39;s also a large</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.909" end="01:54:45.730" style="s2">number of people looking for a</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.320" end="01:54:48.010" style="s2">discussion that doesn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.730" end="01:54:51.760" style="s2">mind-numbing characteristic yeah which</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.010" end="01:54:53.440" style="s2">is why the IDW layer did so well is that</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.760" end="01:54:55.059" style="s2">lots of people were feeling backed</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.440" end="01:54:57.670" style="s2">against the wall and then suddenly they</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.059" end="01:54:59.320" style="s2">were talking heads who didn&#39;t frankly</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.670" end="01:55:01.780" style="s2">agree with each other on you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.320" end="01:55:03.940" style="s2">politics but did agree with each other</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.780" end="01:55:06.969" style="s2">on the fact that a this movement was a</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.940" end="01:55:09.159" style="s2">problem and that be we needed to be</p>

<p begin="01:57:44.550" end="01:57:50.010" style="s2">have the same problems as you guys so my</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.630" end="01:57:52.590" style="s2">personal experience at the race I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.010" end="01:57:55.620" style="s2">mixed-race so my dad&#39;s Mershon African</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.590" end="01:57:59.040" style="s2">Ireland my mum&#39;s Dutch blond hair blue</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.620" end="01:58:01.740" style="s2">eyes so they&#39;re very very different so</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.040" end="01:58:04.170" style="s2">race was nothing to me inside my</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.740" end="01:58:05.850" style="s2">household yeah and like absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.170" end="01:58:08.430" style="s2">nothing like you can&#39;t even see it</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.850" end="01:58:09.840" style="s2">this is like different power dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.430" end="01:58:15.240" style="s2">enough nothing has anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.840" end="01:58:17.640" style="s2">race and then a full race to become</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.240" end="01:58:19.560" style="s2">something had to leave the home and so</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.640" end="01:58:23.670" style="s2">it was this weird experience of race</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.560" end="01:58:25.890" style="s2">being something very sensitive and</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.670" end="01:58:28.590" style="s2">touchy and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.890" end="01:58:29.160" style="s2">the inputs to give a shit about that</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.590" end="01:58:30.720" style="s2">kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.160" end="01:58:33.720" style="s2">I remember in primary school someone</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.720" end="01:58:37.290" style="s2">said something racist to me and the room</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.720" end="01:58:38.880" style="s2">went oh and in my mind I was like oh you</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.290" end="01:58:40.770" style="s2">know this means I can do whatever I want</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.880" end="01:58:42.000" style="s2">with this guy no way I win yeah I can</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.770" end="01:58:42.690" style="s2">punch him in the teacher won&#39;t even get</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.000" end="01:58:45.320" style="s2">angry at me</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.690" end="01:58:45.320" style="s2">and so I did</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.550" end="01:58:51.860" style="s2">but yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s always been a like</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.030" end="01:58:53.120" style="s2">a bit of a tool yeah it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.860" end="01:58:56.180" style="s2">because I&#39;ve never actually felt it and</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.120" end="01:58:59.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve experienced I think Australia is</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.180" end="01:59:02.420" style="s2">really good I think it&#39;s excellent for</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.020" end="01:59:06.080" style="s2">first generations there&#39;s no issues</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.420" end="01:59:07.850" style="s2">there&#39;s been some weird joking about</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.080" end="01:59:10.060" style="s2">race with because I grew up in the</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.850" end="01:59:12.470" style="s2">suburbs the blue-collar people and</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.060" end="01:59:13.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of jokes around race but I</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.470" end="01:59:16.510" style="s2">always thought it was a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.610" end="01:59:19.160" style="s2">inclusive racism you know way because</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.510" end="01:59:21.050" style="s2">the jokes weren&#39;t dissimilar to the fat</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.160" end="01:59:22.760" style="s2">kid or the kid with red hair or you</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.050" end="01:59:24.320" style="s2">don&#39;t have just feeling it out there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.760" end="01:59:25.730" style="s2">taking the piss out of each other</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.320" end="01:59:27.560" style="s2">dynamic yeah that is a little</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.730" end="01:59:29.240" style="s2">uncomfortable to describe it really is</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.560" end="01:59:31.070" style="s2">actually kind of a normal part of being</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.240" end="01:59:33.350" style="s2">human and it includes all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.070" end="01:59:36.710" style="s2">yeah and the racial element of it was</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.350" end="01:59:38.600" style="s2">just you have to get someone where you</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.710" end="01:59:39.740" style="s2">think it might be an Australian thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.600" end="01:59:41.180" style="s2">yep you get someone where you think</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.740" end="01:59:42.380" style="s2">they&#39;ll be sensitive right and then if</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.180" end="01:59:44.750" style="s2">you let them play with that then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.380" end="01:59:46.490" style="s2">intimacy yeah and so to block that off I</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.750" end="01:59:47.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know how I would have fit in</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.490" end="01:59:49.610" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t think I would have fit in</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.900" end="01:59:53.150" style="s2">very well totally so it was very</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.610" end="01:59:54.740" style="s2">multicultural place I grew up in it</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.150" end="01:59:57.830" style="s2">always seemed like at all like I think</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.740" end="01:59:59.450" style="s2">the first time I actually felt that</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.830" end="02:00:02.060" style="s2">hanging out with in the arts and</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.450" end="02:00:04.250" style="s2">entertainment with with the progressives</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.060" end="02:00:07.850" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s very much insert Brown</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.250" end="02:00:10.460" style="s2">man here or we&#39;ve got this thing and</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.850" end="02:00:12.980" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a difference like we can</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.460" end="02:00:14.990" style="s2">use you because of that and it was and</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.980" end="02:00:17.180" style="s2">that they were all very they were too</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.990" end="02:00:19.310" style="s2">sensitive around it like what is this</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.180" end="02:00:21.860" style="s2">magical creature from another land and</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.310" end="02:00:23.600" style="s2">and and that felt like it was an</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.860" end="02:00:31.010" style="s2">authoring it was like an authoring of</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.600" end="02:00:32.750" style="s2">inclusion and mothering of oh man hang</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.010" end="02:00:34.880" style="s2">out with the guys call me a black prick</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.750" end="02:00:39.440" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re less racist</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.880" end="02:00:42.500" style="s2">than you guys in some sense and so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.440" end="02:00:43.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been a strange strange journey</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.500" end="02:00:45.350" style="s2">around the race stuff for me because I</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.940" end="02:00:48.380" style="s2">don&#39;t feel it but also put my foot in</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.350" end="02:00:50.210" style="s2">things they can I know that the history</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.380" end="02:00:52.130" style="s2">here is a lot more sensitive than I</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.210" end="02:00:55.550" style="s2">think it is back home I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.130" end="02:00:56.020" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t want to step on the</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.550" end="02:00:57.580" style="s2">probe</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.020" end="02:01:01.510" style="s2">within the aboriginal communities and</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.580" end="02:01:05.770" style="s2">what the MMI country did to the first</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.510" end="02:01:08.170" style="s2">people but I do think we&#39;re matters</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.770" end="02:01:10.510" style="s2">Australia is really really really good</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.170" end="02:01:12.220" style="s2">so we had a white Australia policy in</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.510" end="02:01:13.660" style="s2">the 70s and that got abolished where was</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.220" end="02:01:15.820" style="s2">just like only people who were allowed</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.660" end="02:01:18.340" style="s2">to come in more white so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.820" end="02:01:21.130" style="s2">explicit racism right yeah they</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.340" end="02:01:23.470" style="s2">abolished that and then they wanted so</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.130" end="02:01:25.720" style="s2">that was Simpson Baalak we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.470" end="02:01:28.420" style="s2">be racist anymore and so and so they did</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.720" end="02:01:31.510" style="s2">that my dad who came from a country who</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.420" end="02:01:33.940" style="s2">would imploded because of the English</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.510" end="02:01:35.590" style="s2">moved out and then there was racial</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.940" end="02:01:37.750" style="s2">tensions and so it was actually like</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.590" end="02:01:40.690" style="s2">hardcore racism that was going on there</p>

<p begin="02:03:41.239" end="02:03:46.670" style="s2">up from that one of them has to do with</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.080" end="02:03:48.800" style="s2">something that you and I have talked</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.670" end="02:03:51.409" style="s2">about which is that you know I can&#39;t say</p>

<p begin="02:03:59.239" end="02:04:06.380" style="s2">impacts but it&#39;s not the way I approach</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.070" end="02:04:08.360" style="s2">my own life it&#39;s not the way I approach</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.380" end="02:04:10.449" style="s2">other people and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.360" end="02:04:13.120" style="s2">camaraderie every time I meet somebody</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.449" end="02:04:17.510" style="s2">who can say the same thing about their</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.120" end="02:04:20.870" style="s2">origin there&#39;s a kind of meeting and I</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.510" end="02:04:23.710" style="s2">want it defined so that people can join</p>

<p begin="02:04:29.449" end="02:04:33.290" style="s2">is something that we had to write years</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.489" end="02:04:36.260" style="s2">ago we had it well and I think the thing</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.290" end="02:04:37.610" style="s2">is it&#39;s always it has since the civil</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.260" end="02:04:39.890" style="s2">rights movement in this country it has</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.610" end="02:04:41.989" style="s2">been the proper aspiration that sit</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.890" end="02:04:45.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the one we if we can find a way</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.989" end="02:04:47.900" style="s2">to tell people that this critical race</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.320" end="02:04:50.210" style="s2">series are operating in the same sphere</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.900" end="02:04:51.800" style="s2">as the white nationalists yeah are the</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.210" end="02:04:53.989" style="s2">same people they just think that the</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.800" end="02:04:56.449" style="s2">rewards should go into the different</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.989" end="02:04:59.120" style="s2">teams yeah exactly if we can let people</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.449" end="02:05:02.120" style="s2">understand that then they they currently</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.120" end="02:05:03.710" style="s2">occupy some moral high ground right they</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.120" end="02:05:05.780" style="s2">don&#39;t and they they have not earned they</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.710" end="02:05:07.460" style="s2">it&#39;s horrific when you look at it and so</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.780" end="02:05:08.989" style="s2">this this is something and this is why</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.460" end="02:05:10.340" style="s2">you Martin Luther King gets brought up a</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.989" end="02:05:12.380" style="s2">lot because it&#39;s right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.340" end="02:05:14.210" style="s2">contentious because we all like the</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.380" end="02:05:14.500" style="s2">Martin Luther King story and so it has</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.210" end="02:05:17.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.500" end="02:05:19.150" style="s2">attacked for being somehow you know</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.160" end="02:05:24.610" style="s2">ill-conceived or failed or something</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.150" end="02:05:27.190" style="s2">like that which it isn&#39;t so the the</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.610" end="02:05:30.010" style="s2">thing that you know you sometimes hear</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.190" end="02:05:32.530" style="s2">religious people talking about their</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.010" end="02:05:34.900" style="s2">faith yeah and for those of us I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.530" end="02:05:37.870" style="s2">know where you stand but for me I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.900" end="02:05:43.960" style="s2">a person of faith and I can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.870" end="02:05:46.360" style="s2">relate to the the emotional power that</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.960" end="02:05:48.940" style="s2">they report yeah for having embraced</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.360" end="02:05:52.450" style="s2">this yeah but I feel something like what</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.940" end="02:05:54.300" style="s2">they describe in the space of people who</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.450" end="02:05:58.870" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna be very careful about this</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.300" end="02:06:00.640" style="s2">don&#39;t give a shit about race okay don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.870" end="02:06:03.720" style="s2">give a shit about race does not mean</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.640" end="02:06:07.270" style="s2">that you don&#39;t see it yeah colorblind is</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.720" end="02:06:10.060" style="s2">something the civilization has to be yes</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.270" end="02:06:12.040" style="s2">it has to be it doesn&#39;t mean that it</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.060" end="02:06:13.780" style="s2">can&#39;t see that you have a racial</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.040" end="02:06:15.880" style="s2">background and doesn&#39;t care about it to</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.780" end="02:06:17.440" style="s2">the extent it&#39;s important it means that</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.880" end="02:06:19.120" style="s2">when you come into a court your race</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.440" end="02:06:22.270" style="s2">can&#39;t matter when you walk into a</p>
<p begin="02:06:19.120" end="02:06:24.100" style="s2">classroom your race cannot matter you</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.270" end="02:06:26.950" style="s2">can it come up at some point if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.100" end="02:06:29.470" style="s2">relevant to a discussion yes but your</p>

<p begin="02:06:29.470" end="02:06:34.960" style="s2">the thing that I want to convey about it</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.350" end="02:06:37.990" style="s2">is that I think I think it is true that</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.960" end="02:06:43.990" style="s2">people who have made this step to human</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.990" end="02:06:46.660" style="s2">first experience a huge leap in the</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.990" end="02:06:48.790" style="s2">quality of their life that this is like</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.660" end="02:06:50.920" style="s2">a raise you can give yourself mmm that</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.790" end="02:06:53.530" style="s2">at the point that you abandon suspicions</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.920" end="02:06:55.000" style="s2">of people based on their race yeah it is</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.530" end="02:06:56.500" style="s2">a huge weight off your vendors and</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.000" end="02:06:58.240" style="s2">walking down the street is a better</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.500" end="02:07:01.930" style="s2">experience this is a scary thing like</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.240" end="02:07:04.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking to a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.930" end="02:07:05.860" style="s2">white men those evil white men and a lot</p>

<p begin="02:07:11.380" end="02:07:16.930" style="s2">black person then having to think how to</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.720" end="02:07:18.700" style="s2">calculate too much too much yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.930" end="02:07:22.060" style="s2">it&#39;s so horrible to me cuz that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.700" end="02:07:23.580" style="s2">like racism it&#39;s kind of reforming out</p>

<p begin="02:07:26.850" end="02:07:31.620" style="s2">think about it&#39;s alright I totally agree</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.310" end="02:07:34.350" style="s2">with its the breakdown of something that</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.620" end="02:07:36.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t perfect yes definitely work yeah</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.350" end="02:07:38.670" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t perfect but but it was better</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.390" end="02:07:42.690" style="s2">well let&#39;s take here&#39;s my favorite</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.670" end="02:07:45.900" style="s2">example of this the n-word yeah for</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.690" end="02:07:46.640" style="s2">decades in this country we had an</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.900" end="02:07:49.170" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.640" end="02:07:52.770" style="s2">largely unspoken yeah but an agreement</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.170" end="02:07:56.160" style="s2">why people didn&#39;t use the n-word black</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.770" end="02:07:59.610" style="s2">people were free to I think that was the</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.160" end="02:08:02.540" style="s2">right arrangement it is not the right</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.610" end="02:08:05.640" style="s2">arrangement at the point that it can be</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.540" end="02:08:07.770" style="s2">prosecuted especially if it is</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.640" end="02:08:10.950" style="s2">prosecuted by the simple fact of having</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.770" end="02:08:13.200" style="s2">uttered the sum yeah not even no intent</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.950" end="02:08:15.090" style="s2">behind it right there are lots of</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.200" end="02:08:17.510" style="s2">reasons to use the n-word if you had a</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.090" end="02:08:20.760" style="s2">white person yeah let&#39;s suppose you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.510" end="02:08:23.040" style="s2">you know in a production of Huck Finn</p>
<p begin="02:08:20.760" end="02:08:23.670" style="s2">yeah right yeah you might have to say it</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.040" end="02:08:28.740" style="s2">yeah right</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.670" end="02:08:30.360" style="s2">suppose you&#39;re referring to you know</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.740" end="02:08:33.660" style="s2">suppose I mean we&#39;re now in a problem</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.360" end="02:08:35.550" style="s2">where hip-hop invokes analogues of the</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.660" end="02:08:37.020" style="s2">n-word yeah sometimes the n-word itself</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.550" end="02:08:38.490" style="s2">and white people aren&#39;t apparently</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.020" end="02:08:40.830" style="s2">allowed to sing it and then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.490" end="02:08:43.560" style="s2">is the the other one someone recently</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.830" end="02:08:45.390" style="s2">was doing a using a I think they built</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.560" end="02:08:47.790" style="s2">to do a discourse analysis yeah now</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.390" end="02:08:51.180" style="s2">we&#39;re actually trying to map who was</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.790" end="02:08:55.590" style="s2">actually racist in the OLT right area</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.180" end="02:08:57.780" style="s2">and by mapping a lot of the the output</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.590" end="02:08:59.370" style="s2">and so obviously the n-word is gonna be</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.780" end="02:09:01.620" style="s2">a big indicator there but they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.370" end="02:09:07.250" style="s2">allowed to present their present their</p>
<p begin="02:09:01.620" end="02:09:09.480" style="s2">findings yeah no actually doing some</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.250" end="02:09:13.320" style="s2">scholarly work you might have to say it</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.480" end="02:09:15.030" style="s2">so anyway we had a gentlemen&#39;s agreement</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.320" end="02:09:16.860" style="s2">to compromise a term but we had a</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.030" end="02:09:19.620" style="s2">gentlemen&#39;s agreement that worked</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.860" end="02:09:21.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember people in my circle</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.620" end="02:09:24.180" style="s2">ever violating it in earnest yeah right</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.840" end="02:09:26.400" style="s2">but it had to be predicated on the</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.180" end="02:09:29.340" style="s2">discretion that actually yes this white</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.400" end="02:09:32.400" style="s2">person did use the n-word but they did</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.340" end="02:09:34.229" style="s2">not do it with intent therefore can I</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.400" end="02:09:36.689" style="s2">bring that back to this the the</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.229" end="02:09:39.239" style="s2">the theology sure so what what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.689" end="02:09:44.099" style="s2">doing they&#39;re so durkheimian view of</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.239" end="02:09:46.709" style="s2">religion is religions have something</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.099" end="02:09:50.189" style="s2">sacred and that&#39;s that&#39;s not to be</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.709" end="02:09:52.139" style="s2">touched right so the way that the way</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.189" end="02:09:54.360" style="s2">that I see that this is has started in</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.139" end="02:09:55.380" style="s2">this in this strange thing is that you</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.360" end="02:09:56.849" style="s2">had the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.380" end="02:09:58.979" style="s2">shake the etch-a-sketch of Western</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.849" end="02:10:02.130" style="s2">civilization so it&#39;s like everything</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.979" end="02:10:04.469" style="s2">could be false and who knows what what</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.130" end="02:10:06.929" style="s2">is true all it is about is about power</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.469" end="02:10:09.269" style="s2">and and and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.929" end="02:10:10.979" style="s2">but it&#39;s very destructive like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.269" end="02:10:13.829" style="s2">just they&#39;re just playing and ripping</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.979" end="02:10:15.840" style="s2">things apart and making people question</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.829" end="02:10:19.999" style="s2">why they believe these these these giant</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.840" end="02:10:25.409" style="s2">narratives then all of a sudden you get</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.999" end="02:10:27.809" style="s2">kimberlé crenshaw who has really she</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.409" end="02:10:32.189" style="s2">said with what we need to do is we need</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.809" end="02:10:36.329" style="s2">to map postmodern techniques on to</p>
<p begin="02:10:32.189" end="02:10:37.979" style="s2">political action and in that she talks</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.329" end="02:10:39.919" style="s2">about what do you keep how do you do</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.979" end="02:10:43.079" style="s2">that because it&#39;s this it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.919" end="02:10:44.669" style="s2">abstract thing it&#39;s it&#39;s where you were</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.079" end="02:10:46.469" style="s2">currently living in the void the edges</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.669" end="02:10:49.429" style="s2">get straight is a blank page and she</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.469" end="02:10:53.309" style="s2">said we do that by keeping oppression</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.429" end="02:10:54.989" style="s2">based on race so she actually did the</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.309" end="02:10:57.659" style="s2">Descartes thing I&#39;m oppressed therefore</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.989" end="02:10:59.369" style="s2">I am that&#39;s all that there is that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.659" end="02:11:01.169" style="s2">that there is yeah she said that</p>
<p begin="02:10:59.369" end="02:11:03.019" style="s2">oppression is the thing we can keep and</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.169" end="02:11:05.669" style="s2">we can build everything else around</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.019" end="02:11:07.619" style="s2">oppression so that&#39;s that&#39;s the sacred</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.669" end="02:11:09.419" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s that so it&#39;s oppression</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.619" end="02:11:11.039" style="s2">its victimhood and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.419" end="02:11:14.550" style="s2">victimhood culture comes from there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.039" end="02:11:16.469" style="s2">this this is 30 years of scholarship on</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.550" end="02:11:19.829" style="s2">top of this this one thing where</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.469" end="02:11:21.510" style="s2">oppression based on identity is the only</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.829" end="02:11:23.459" style="s2">thing that&#39;s real and if you speak to</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.510" end="02:11:24.840" style="s2">these people you&#39;ll you&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.459" end="02:11:27.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the only thing that they they</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.840" end="02:11:31.829" style="s2">hold sacred and they keep steady that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.199" end="02:11:34.679" style="s2">fascinating yeah so I will just say to</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.829" end="02:11:39.119" style="s2">my audience that I think what you have</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.679" end="02:11:41.189" style="s2">just unleashed here is a absolutely key</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.119" end="02:11:44.369" style="s2">insight and it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.189" end="02:11:46.710" style="s2">meaning of what sacred is and that if</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.369" end="02:11:49.260" style="s2">you miss apply the</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.710" end="02:11:51.030" style="s2">the normal stuff that goes along with</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.260" end="02:11:52.350" style="s2">the sacred and you apply it to</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.030" end="02:11:58.110" style="s2">oppression mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.350" end="02:12:01.680" style="s2">then you create a situation where as you</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.110" end="02:12:03.570" style="s2">approach the asymptotes of a world in</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.680" end="02:12:04.980" style="s2">which people are judged on the content</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.570" end="02:12:08.610" style="s2">of their character rather than the color</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.980" end="02:12:11.820" style="s2">of their skin you have to work backwards</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.610" end="02:12:16.050" style="s2">because you can&#39;t bear for the thing at</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.820" end="02:12:19.410" style="s2">the core to evaporate yeah and that</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.050" end="02:12:22.550" style="s2">explains what Douglas Murray has pointed</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.410" end="02:12:25.500" style="s2">out about the tendency of these</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.550" end="02:12:27.090" style="s2">movements that fight oppression to keep</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.500" end="02:12:31.380" style="s2">going even after they&#39;ve gotten to the</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.090" end="02:12:34.680" style="s2">station yeah so anyway yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:12:31.380" end="02:12:40.590" style="s2">that&#39;s a key piece of another podcast</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.680" end="02:12:41.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole nother film yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.590" end="02:12:43.500" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.730" end="02:12:46.350" style="s2">let me go back and clean up a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.500" end="02:12:49.670" style="s2">thing civilization has to aim towards</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.350" end="02:12:52.560" style="s2">colorblindness mmm individuals have to I</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.670" end="02:12:54.810" style="s2">won&#39;t say have to but I think they would</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.560" end="02:12:57.450" style="s2">be wise every single individual would be</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.810" end="02:13:00.570" style="s2">wise to check in with the idea of being</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.450" end="02:13:03.600" style="s2">human first and shedding all of the cost</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.570" end="02:13:08.100" style="s2">that they pay out of whatever bigotries</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.600" end="02:13:11.150" style="s2">and suspicions they might Harbor but</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.100" end="02:13:15.780" style="s2">this does not mean that anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.150" end="02:13:18.239" style="s2">ethnicity or background can be or should</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.780" end="02:13:19.980" style="s2">be erased and I wanted to tell a little</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.239" end="02:13:22.530" style="s2">story in light of what you were saying</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.980" end="02:13:26.430" style="s2">about people joking about race oh yeah</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.530" end="02:13:29.850" style="s2">fat kid and all that I&#39;m gonna shield</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.430" end="02:13:33.000" style="s2">the identities here because because I</p>
<p begin="02:13:29.850" end="02:13:34.830" style="s2">think I have to and what yeah that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.000" end="02:13:36.239" style="s2">really why and in fact I think everybody</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.830" end="02:13:38.640" style="s2">involved in the story would be cool with</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.239" end="02:13:40.820" style="s2">it but I just I&#39;m not so sure that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.640" end="02:13:45.360" style="s2">ready to take the risk on their behalf</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.820" end="02:13:48.710" style="s2">somebody well-known very well-known oh</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.360" end="02:13:51.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason okay in the IDW sphere</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.710" end="02:13:54.630" style="s2">he invited Heather and me to a dinner</p>
<p begin="02:13:51.540" end="02:13:57.000" style="s2">party an intimate dinner party at this</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.630" end="02:13:57.980" style="s2">person&#39;s house and there were guests</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.000" end="02:14:01.130" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.980" end="02:14:05.450" style="s2">that she clearly had carefully chosen</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.130" end="02:14:10.670" style="s2">who would be a good person to to be at</p>
<p begin="02:14:05.450" end="02:14:14.180" style="s2">the dinner and a woman at the party told</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.670" end="02:14:18.200" style="s2">a joke at the dinner table and the joke</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.180" end="02:14:20.900" style="s2">was do you know what the definition of</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.200" end="02:14:24.290" style="s2">anti-semitism is and I said no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.900" end="02:14:29.570" style="s2">she says it&#39;s hating Jews more than is</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.290" end="02:14:32.540" style="s2">necessary right and I must say that joke</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.570" end="02:14:34.370" style="s2">could be taken very negatively yeah</p>
<p begin="02:14:32.540" end="02:14:36.710" style="s2">but the context of that joke it was</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.370" end="02:14:38.780" style="s2">delivered in full knowledge of what</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.710" end="02:14:42.580" style="s2">table she was at yeah who she was</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.780" end="02:14:50.450" style="s2">talking to yeah and it felt very</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.580" end="02:14:53.980" style="s2">welcoming that this joke actually point</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.450" end="02:14:57.050" style="s2">what there&#39;s some natural tension around</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.980" end="02:15:00.020" style="s2">Jews yeah right yeah and that&#39;s released</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.050" end="02:15:04.520" style="s2">right it it&#39;s your say the point is joke</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.020" end="02:15:06.590" style="s2">was an embrace and it was complex yeah</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.520" end="02:15:10.060" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to even report it so it</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.590" end="02:15:12.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cause people to say how long</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.060" end="02:15:14.690" style="s2">right but the point is but the feelings</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.980" end="02:15:21.350" style="s2">in the room is she knew what shall</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.690" end="02:15:25.280" style="s2">circumstellar yes she knew how right and</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.350" end="02:15:27.260" style="s2">so anyway you can&#39;t write the rule no I</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.280" end="02:15:29.330" style="s2">challenge you to write the rule that</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.260" end="02:15:32.660" style="s2">explains why that joke is okay yeah</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.330" end="02:15:35.350" style="s2">right that joke is okay because of</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.660" end="02:15:37.760" style="s2">something really deep inside that</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.350" end="02:15:41.450" style="s2">understands how it will be heard on the</p>
