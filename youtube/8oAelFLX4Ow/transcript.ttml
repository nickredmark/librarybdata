<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:09.800" style="s2">February 25th today&#39;s question is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.540" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">steps can we take towards collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.800" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">curation or distributed leadership or</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">whatever you want to call the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have a word that is it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:24.029" style="s2">how do we get shit done without a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">central leadership body how do we do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.029" end="00:00:27.689" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about last couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">weeks so who would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.689" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">I can always start it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">very very tricky notion I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">huge amount to say here other than the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:42.629" style="s2">points out that it&#39;s a very very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:45.390" style="s2">notion because we are fundamentally not</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.629" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">used to working that way right we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:00:48.629" style="s2">used to having a person in charge it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:51.629" style="s2">responsible for whatever the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">and you know that some people doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.629" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">different people doing different ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">but essentially that you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">they they are the ones who direct things</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">and so when something goes wrong people</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:01.859" style="s2">turn to them for direction as to how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">go about putting it right you know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.859" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">I mean there and we are this is ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">into us from a very very very young age</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">I mean if you think of your 13 years of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">schooling right and the above and be all</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">it above and beyond all else it taught</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:16.470" style="s2">you to shut up do as you&#39;re told and pay</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">attention to authority figures right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.470" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">so that this you know in game B language</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:23.909" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s that broadcast modality</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">right we&#39;ve been trained to be receptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.909" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">to broadcast and not to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">responsibility for our own little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">the thing that we can take</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">responsibility for so that&#39;s that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:34.650" style="s2">I have to say I think it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">very very very tricky just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.650" end="00:01:37.909" style="s2">not used to it that&#39;s that&#39;s all I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:42.500" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.909" end="00:01:44.740" style="s2">all right French are Kira wanna go I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.500" end="00:01:44.740" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.119" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">Eric I appreciate what you shared and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:57.229" style="s2">was reminded of a conversation that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:59.149" style="s2">heard the that Jordan Hall had and where</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.229" end="00:02:02.179" style="s2">he was talking about sort of the history</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.149" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">of God what got us here and prior to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.179" end="00:02:08.030" style="s2">know groups getting beyond the size of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">Dunbar number it was more of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.030" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">collective decision you know there there</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">was more of a collective or it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:15.530" style="s2">possible to have more of a collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:18.170" style="s2">decision-making and then once things get</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.530" end="00:02:21.049" style="s2">got beyond the Dunbar number then we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.170" end="00:02:24.530" style="s2">to have people in positions of authority</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.049" end="00:02:28.010" style="s2">and it was no longer about collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.530" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">decision-making and so the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.010" end="00:02:35.540" style="s2">think in terms of steps to make towards</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:40.940" style="s2">being able to do that is a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.540" end="00:02:43.370" style="s2">things one is the ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">responsibility but that and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.370" end="00:02:48.430" style="s2">something that&#39;s been coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:48.430" style="s2">various conversations which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.790" end="00:02:54.440" style="s2">recognizing that like something might</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.350" end="00:02:57.019" style="s2">not be your fault and take and taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.440" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">responsibility like there there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.019" end="00:03:01.069" style="s2">thing of if if it&#39;s if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:02.329" style="s2">responsible for it and it doesn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.069" end="00:03:02.930" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t go right it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.329" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.930" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">and moving away from a fault-finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.150" end="00:03:17.720" style="s2">paradigm towards a towards something</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.269" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">else and I and and I&#39;ll be open to what</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.720" end="00:03:24.220" style="s2">word might make more sense but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:27.609" style="s2">moving away from fault and towards a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.220" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">toward responsibility but also towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.609" end="00:03:36.859" style="s2">okay what is what can we learn from this</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:39.230" style="s2">not who&#39;s not whose fault is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.859" end="00:03:46.810" style="s2">and I&#39;m reminded of something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.230" end="00:03:50.509" style="s2">happens in the tech world of a like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.810" end="00:03:51.800" style="s2">like going over when something goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.509" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">wrong going over it not</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.800" end="00:03:54.980" style="s2">the intention of finding out whose fault</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">it is but finding out how the system can</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.980" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">improve and I think that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:07.580" style="s2">part and there&#39;s individually what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:09.260" style="s2">can do to take responsibility and be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.580" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">comfortable with that and that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">something that you know I think there</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">are certain forms of responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">we&#39;re comfortable that that people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">comfortable with and then other ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:22.310" style="s2">where it&#39;s like no I can&#39;t I I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:25.750" style="s2">possibly handle that I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.310" end="00:04:25.750" style="s2">take responsibility for that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">understanding or and getting comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">and I think like all things game be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">getting comfortable with being</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.640" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">uncomfortable because the more I can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:43.670" style="s2">and being comfortable with the ambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.230" style="s2">with there isn&#39;t somebody there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.670" end="00:04:47.240" style="s2">some authority figure that I can go to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.230" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">who&#39;s going to give me the answer there</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.240" end="00:04:52.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily going to be certainty</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:56.510" style="s2">in how to move forward and getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.100" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">comfortable with that and and because as</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.510" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">long as there&#39;s a person in authority</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:01.910" style="s2">who can give me an answer then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:03.890" style="s2">certain than I am then I have certainty</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.910" end="00:05:07.250" style="s2">and I know you know there&#39;s an expert</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.890" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">there who can who can tell me and but if</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.250" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t have that I&#39;m like wow what do I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:15.710" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:18.500" style="s2">and and so getting comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.710" end="00:05:23.060" style="s2">ambiguity I think is a huge part in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.500" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">moving us towards the collective you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.060" end="00:05:31.700" style="s2">know and like I think of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">curation leadership sense making like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.700" end="00:05:35.990" style="s2">all of those different things curation</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:37.130" style="s2">is an interesting word and so when when</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.990" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">we open it up for a larger discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.130" end="00:05:41.570" style="s2">I&#39;d be like I&#39;ll be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:43.910" style="s2">hearing kind of what what other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.570" end="00:05:46.040" style="s2">takes are on that on on the word</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.910" end="00:05:48.190" style="s2">curation in particular so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.040" end="00:05:48.190" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:57.650" style="s2">kyaa you want to go Brent you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.260" end="00:05:57.860" style="s2">go it&#39;s going to us doesn&#39;t matter all</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.650" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.860" end="00:06:01.569" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:04.099" style="s2">um because I think I usually go last</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.569" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">whoever else go first the last week I</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.099" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">don&#39;t Brett would last this is a topic</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">that just like last week where we set</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:16.159" style="s2">the topic and then shit happened this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:17.900" style="s2">kind of what I wanted to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.159" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">then one of my communities that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.900" end="00:06:20.090" style="s2">been following for a really long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:21.949" style="s2">fell</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.090" end="00:06:23.449" style="s2">didn&#39;t fall apart but it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.949" end="00:06:25.819" style="s2">like it fell apart because the person it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.449" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">centered around had this fall from grace</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.819" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of entered the me2 movement</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:33.110" style="s2">with his own story and all these people</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">that that are his clients that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.110" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">tried to sleep with and slept with and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.050" style="s2">had relationships with and whether he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:40.810" style="s2">in a main relationship or not it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.050" end="00:06:44.419" style="s2">confusing he hasn&#39;t yet had a statement</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.810" end="00:06:47.050" style="s2">but the fragility of leadership that</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.050" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">any cracks form they fall and then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.409" end="00:06:56.750" style="s2">surrounding community falls and the</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.750" end="00:07:01.250" style="s2">really happen in the case of like what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.479" end="00:07:03.710" style="s2">talked about last week with my community</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.250" end="00:07:05.690" style="s2">where this person may have a conflict</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.710" end="00:07:07.099" style="s2">but the community is not going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.690" end="00:07:09.469" style="s2">because we have a conflict at the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.099" end="00:07:11.839" style="s2">time there&#39;s no one to go to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.469" end="00:07:13.129" style="s2">there&#39;s the processing team but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.839" end="00:07:14.750" style="s2">trying to do it faster than they did</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.129" end="00:07:18.020" style="s2">last time and I still have yet to get an</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.750" end="00:07:21.589" style="s2">email a week and a bit later and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:24.020" style="s2">like the how do we as a taught as</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.589" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">sovereign individuals take ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.020" end="00:07:28.879" style="s2">our own lives our own feelings when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:30.110" style="s2">want someone in leadership over us or</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.879" end="00:07:33.379" style="s2">when we want to be a leadership over</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.110" end="00:07:35.210" style="s2">somebody else and at the same time how</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.379" end="00:07:37.490" style="s2">does shit get done how does conflict get</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.210" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">resolved how does approach a project</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.490" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">move forward either by having a central</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:45.229" style="s2">you know embodied group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:48.289" style="s2">can have a conversation to come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.229" end="00:07:52.099" style="s2">consensus or or not and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.289" end="00:07:54.169" style="s2">that we have to play in and with because</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.099" end="00:07:56.150" style="s2">we&#39;re never gonna get to game B if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.169" end="00:07:57.770" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out how to have distributed</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.150" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">leadership how did not leave it up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.770" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">someone else how to take on what is ours</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:05.330" style="s2">and leave for other people what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.949" end="00:08:07.099" style="s2">theirs and organize it in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.330" end="00:08:09.649" style="s2">it&#39;s not completely chaotic you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.099" end="00:08:11.270" style="s2">like who to go to with an issue or what</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.649" end="00:08:12.540" style="s2">type of people to go to with an issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.270" end="00:08:14.910" style="s2">and there&#39;s multiple people</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.540" end="00:08:17.610" style="s2">you can go to and so I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.910" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">solutions in this realm but we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.610" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">used to it being this top-down hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:23.460" style="s2">that we all want that like we are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.930" end="00:08:25.200" style="s2">like well wait who&#39;s the leader who do I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.460" end="00:08:26.460" style="s2">go to who do I complain about and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.200" end="00:08:28.890" style="s2">when the leader falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.460" end="00:08:31.560" style="s2">there really isn&#39;t to anyone the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.890" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">falls apart of that and that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.560" end="00:08:36.300" style="s2">have resilience beyond a single or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:37.500" style="s2">tiny group of leadership we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.300" end="00:08:38.940" style="s2">able to have those interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.500" end="00:08:41.900" style="s2">relationships and own our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.940" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">sovereignty and that is what I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.900" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">I&#39;m done</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.770" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">I&#39;m always fine you know what the topic</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.900" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">is like two minutes before I jump on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">call which is fun because it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:01.520" style="s2">mean I I like it because it&#39;s I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:03.620" style="s2">prepared right then it&#39;s like it is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.520" end="00:09:06.970" style="s2">good topic what how can we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.620" end="00:09:09.590" style="s2">curate because curation is implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.970" end="00:09:12.110" style="s2">many platforms and communities like New</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.590" end="00:09:14.450" style="s2">York Times big thing and most critics</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.110" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">are kinda critical because of that like</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.450" end="00:09:18.230" style="s2">what they choose to put in and what they</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:20.090" style="s2">choose to leave out right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.230" end="00:09:22.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of decision-making there</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.090" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">whether it&#39;s by individuals or committee</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.490" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of curation in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">space too and like rebel wisdoms space</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:35.930" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to crap on them too</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:37.400" style="s2">much but but you know along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.930" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">the things I&#39;ve said for for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.400" end="00:09:42.680" style="s2">years is some of their stuff is good</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.770" end="00:09:45.260" style="s2">some of its bad right and what they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.680" end="00:09:47.080" style="s2">doing fundamentally is curating right</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.260" end="00:09:49.700" style="s2">curating these different thinkers Oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.080" end="00:09:51.650" style="s2">Daniel dr. Berger Jordan Hall and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.700" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it creates a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.650" end="00:09:57.320" style="s2">around those attractors mm-hmm but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:09:59.450" style="s2">know it&#39;s also what what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.320" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">platforming like all the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.450" end="00:10:05.060" style="s2">dark web stuff and and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:07.730" style="s2">ignoring or what they&#39;re blocking which</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.060" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">is in any type of criticism of that type</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.730" end="00:10:14.180" style="s2">of stuff so hmm like just it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">general sense to come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.180" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">question of curation it&#39;s it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:24.710" style="s2">question of what we eat value as as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:26.750" style="s2">group as individuals and you know come</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.710" end="00:10:28.610" style="s2">coming back to the issues you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.750" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">raising about what&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.610" end="00:10:35.390" style="s2">contend with um you know I think we we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:37.460" style="s2">select things we curate things on our</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.390" end="00:10:43.580" style="s2">own feeds that that are comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.460" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">right even if they&#39;re on the face of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.580" end="00:10:52.280" style="s2">very interesting and very provocative it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">might still appeal to something within</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.280" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">us that is an appeal to simplicity like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:11:04.130" style="s2">oh I prefer the curation of things this</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s only like two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.130" end="00:11:14.940" style="s2">minutes but mmm I really can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">anything else you&#39;re allowed to end</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.940" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">early it&#39;s not a try to draw it out five</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:23.640" style="s2">minutes so now we can all that Mike if</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:27.690" style="s2">we want to and have an open conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.640" end="00:11:29.940" style="s2">as we do what came up for me this week</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.690" end="00:11:31.380" style="s2">in both my thing in my individual</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.940" end="00:11:36.990" style="s2">community and this thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.380" end="00:11:40.530" style="s2">happening with Kyle sees is that in me</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.990" end="00:11:43.020" style="s2">in my own personal being I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.530" end="00:11:44.940" style="s2">having fun with the drama and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.020" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">like that about me like I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.940" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">like like when the community member</p>

<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:53.340" style="s2">email me and I write it out was and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.390" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">was a piece that likes the drama that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.340" end="00:11:56.490" style="s2">wants the drama to continue and like</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:11:58.380" style="s2">he&#39;d seek you know going to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.490" end="00:12:00.390" style="s2">person&#39;s Facebook page because Kyle sees</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.380" end="00:12:03.390" style="s2">hasn&#39;t posted anything so it&#39;s only this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.390" end="00:12:06.360" style="s2">one person who&#39;s a Facebook page that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.390" end="00:12:07.890" style="s2">has has all this stuff on it because his</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.360" end="00:12:09.570" style="s2">is way to curate it has to go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.890" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">admin so it&#39;s never coming out if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.570" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">on his page but it&#39;s on his other page</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.630" end="00:12:24.780" style="s2">that in myself and sitting with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.280" end="00:12:26.730" style="s2">uncomfortableness of that like and yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.780" end="00:12:28.650" style="s2">I&#39;d have very little drama in my life so</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.730" end="00:12:30.300" style="s2">it is like what am I here to learn but</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:37.650" style="s2">also the need to like almost like keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.310" end="00:12:39.630" style="s2">the drama going like oh what&#39;s next once</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.800" end="00:12:53.100" style="s2">perpetuating that can I can I just</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.640" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">because this is a line that I think for</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.100" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">me anyway needs needs to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.080" end="00:12:59.100" style="s2">clearly delineated as that between</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:00.930" style="s2">distributes the notion of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.100" end="00:13:04.620" style="s2">leadership and distributed curation</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.930" end="00:13:06.090" style="s2">because leadership you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.620" end="00:13:08.400" style="s2">nothing in one person&#39;s hands and it can</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.090" end="00:13:11.130" style="s2">be fluid and it can move around but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.400" end="00:13:12.120" style="s2">idea of leadership being distributed I</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.130" end="00:13:17.790" style="s2">mean either do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.120" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">there was a Oh God was it during occupy</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.790" end="00:13:20.910" style="s2">economy anyway there&#39;s this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:25.170" style="s2">oh no we don&#39;t have any leaders right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.910" end="00:13:26.910" style="s2">and you know it without a go-to person</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.170" end="00:13:29.400" style="s2">in a leadership sense without a go-to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.910" end="00:13:31.140" style="s2">person there is no who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.400" end="00:13:33.480" style="s2">responsible for making sure this thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.140" end="00:13:34.350" style="s2">happens you know what I mean and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.480" end="00:13:35.820" style="s2">know doesn&#39;t mean you have to have one</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.350" end="00:13:36.839" style="s2">person in charge all the time or that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.820" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">they have to be also practical</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.839" end="00:13:39.960" style="s2">dictatorial it doesn&#39;t mean any of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.420" style="s2">but but I don&#39;t think you can have</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.960" end="00:13:44.839" style="s2">distributed leadership I almost think</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.420" end="00:13:49.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a contradiction in terms the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.839" end="00:13:52.980" style="s2">curation thing I think that that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.200" end="00:13:54.870" style="s2">be done by one by one person or by a</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.980" end="00:13:58.290" style="s2">small group people write something if</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.870" end="00:14:00.420" style="s2">and so this is coming back to what Kira</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.290" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">asked in her opening thing about what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.420" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">mean by the actual word curation and for</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.330" end="00:14:08.370" style="s2">me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tending it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:10.680" style="s2">looking after it&#39;s a maintaining it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.370" end="00:14:13.200" style="s2">caring about right it&#39;s it&#39;s got those</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.680" end="00:14:15.060" style="s2">sorts of those sorts of aspects to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.200" end="00:14:17.010" style="s2">and so that has to be a collective</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.060" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">effort because if you&#39;re curating a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.010" end="00:14:19.890" style="s2">thing whatever that thing might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:21.900" style="s2">trying to make sure that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.890" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">spoil doesn&#39;t go off doesn&#39;t get ruined</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.900" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">in whatever way then everybody needs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:30.540" style="s2">have their eyes open and most</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:32.459" style="s2">importantly everybody needs to have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.540" end="00:14:34.680" style="s2">kind of con vision some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.459" end="00:14:36.300" style="s2">understanding of what the thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.680" end="00:14:37.980" style="s2">they are trying to curate what is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.300" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">actual essence where is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.980" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">the thing that they are trying to curate</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:45.930" style="s2">what are they trying to keep it as Eric</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:47.700" style="s2">what came up for me as you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.930" end="00:14:49.500" style="s2">about that and you know I&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.700" end="00:14:51.450" style="s2">before that one of the communities that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.500" end="00:14:55.700" style="s2">I&#39;m part of this is 12-step communities</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.450" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">and in 12 there&#39;s the 12 steps but</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.700" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">unless you&#39;re part of the community</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:04.050" style="s2">there&#39;s something else which is called</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:06.420" style="s2">the 12 traditions and that is how to how</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.050" end="00:15:08.040" style="s2">the group have how the group works</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.420" end="00:15:10.589" style="s2">together so the 12 steps is for your</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.040" end="00:15:11.850" style="s2">individual development but the the 12</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.589" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">traditions is about the group and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.850" end="00:15:20.070" style="s2">there&#39;s one in particular that is our</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:25.530" style="s2">leaders are chosen to gov to serve not</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.070" end="00:15:27.990" style="s2">to govern and so most of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.530" end="00:15:29.730" style="s2">every AAA group is is completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.990" end="00:15:32.190" style="s2">independent there&#39;s no you know there</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.730" end="00:15:33.870" style="s2">are there is a central office there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.190" end="00:15:37.230" style="s2">you know there there is some central</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.870" end="00:15:38.760" style="s2">leadership but ultimately all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.230" end="00:15:40.710" style="s2">power rests in the hands of each</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.760" end="00:15:43.770" style="s2">individual group and then each</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.710" end="00:15:46.920" style="s2">individual group has service positions</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:49.290" style="s2">and the people who are elected to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.920" end="00:15:53.580" style="s2">the service positions they have a set</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.290" end="00:15:55.590" style="s2">amount of time and like in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.580" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">the person who&#39;s the secretary who you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.590" end="00:16:00.030" style="s2">could essentially call the leader of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:01.350" style="s2">group they have a set format of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.030" end="00:16:04.170" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to run but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.350" end="00:16:06.960" style="s2">things that they do is they ask people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.170" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">to come in and chair the meeting and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.960" end="00:16:12.090" style="s2">chairing the meeting means they come in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:14.430" style="s2">and share their story and so for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.090" end="00:16:16.650" style="s2">six-month period of time they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.430" end="00:16:18.330" style="s2">serving the group they are coming the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.650" end="00:16:21.570" style="s2">end and part of what it what they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.330" end="00:16:24.450" style="s2">doing is curating who is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.570" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">in and talk to the group and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.450" end="00:16:30.630" style="s2">something about that that I like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:32.460" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a recognition that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.630" end="00:16:34.830" style="s2">group can&#39;t be completely an hour it</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.460" end="00:16:38.910" style="s2">can&#39;t be complete anarchy there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.830" end="00:16:40.650" style="s2">be somebody who is coming in and unlocks</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.910" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">the door and turns on the lights and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.650" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">know makes sure that and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s making sure that the rent</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:49.880" style="s2">gets paid me to end that the the coffee</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:55.650" style="s2">gets made and the chairs get put out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:58.470" style="s2">but it&#39;s that distinct name of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.650" end="00:17:02.370" style="s2">elected to serve not to govern but to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.470" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">serve like that&#39;s such a such a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.370" end="00:17:08.610" style="s2">fundamental part of a a that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">when I look out in the world and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.610" end="00:17:15.500" style="s2">like why can&#39;t we elect people to serve</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:15.500" style="s2">not you know I mean it&#39;s all supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.390" end="00:17:25.860" style="s2">and so yeah that&#39;s just Eric as you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:32.210" style="s2">sharing that was what came to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.860" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">like a a as a great example of of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.210" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">I&#39;m not very interesting because when</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:39.270" style="s2">Eric was talking I camp for me was this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">idea of curation is about</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.270" end="00:17:44.670" style="s2">the project and leadership is about like</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">organizing the people and keeping like</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.670" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">the conflict in alignment that was just</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:53.450" style="s2">like the distinction between the two and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:56.310" style="s2">like in in a and and 12-step programs</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.450" end="00:17:58.650" style="s2">there&#39;s the mission which is stay sober</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.310" end="00:18:00.660" style="s2">but like you can never even even stink</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.650" end="00:18:02.790" style="s2">tably no I can&#39;t be responsible for your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.660" end="00:18:05.550" style="s2">sobriety we can get all the interplay</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.790" end="00:18:07.470" style="s2">and all this but like the the project is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.550" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">our collective sobriety that you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">how many days how many hours hope that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:14.550" style="s2">you&#39;re sober and then the bigger piece</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:16.140" style="s2">of like but there is no I can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.550" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">control of you and you can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.140" end="00:18:20.790" style="s2">control of me it&#39;s it&#39;s your ownership</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:22.650" style="s2">for you because what also came up was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.790" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">this idea that like there is no leader</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.650" end="00:18:26.490" style="s2">to go to but no group most groups don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:29.250" style="s2">have leaders to go to right when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.490" end="00:18:32.370" style="s2">about any identity politics where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.250" end="00:18:33.990" style="s2">like well women or men or queers or</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.370" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">straight people or sis or trans it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.990" end="00:18:36.840" style="s2">like they don&#39;t have meetings right they</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:38.790" style="s2">don&#39;t get together and come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.840" end="00:18:41.190" style="s2">tenant&#39;s and like this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.790" end="00:18:42.690" style="s2">gonna say is is is our is our goal and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:44.190" style="s2">is our like the only thing they have in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.690" end="00:18:46.920" style="s2">common is our identity yet we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.190" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">constantly group them together and kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.920" end="00:18:50.280" style="s2">of say like like why do women like</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:51.630" style="s2">having their their chair pulled out and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.280" end="00:18:54.360" style="s2">not like having their chair pulled out</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.630" end="00:18:57.150" style="s2">because we&#39;re different and in different</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.360" end="00:18:59.340" style="s2">moments and different circumstances like</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.150" end="00:19:00.690" style="s2">there&#39;s something about its kind of okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.340" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t have leadership because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.690" end="00:19:04.170" style="s2">not supposed to at the same time then</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:05.580" style="s2">owning who do you go to to turn the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.170" end="00:19:09.270" style="s2">lights on to get the coffee done like</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.580" end="00:19:10.980" style="s2">having a non Anarchy organization that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.270" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">also owns you&#39;re responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.980" end="00:19:17.970" style="s2">yourself that we have a mission that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:19.920" style="s2">needs curation what came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.970" end="00:19:22.070" style="s2">Jubilee as you were sharing was you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.920" end="00:19:26.100" style="s2">one of the interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.070" end="00:19:32.790" style="s2">12-step is the thing that binds the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.100" end="00:19:36.930" style="s2">group together is survival like you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.790" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">don&#39;t end up in a unless you have no you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.930" end="00:19:42.860" style="s2">know it&#39;s like unless you&#39;re you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:45.180" style="s2">of out of options and you stay because</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.860" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">that is the group of people that helped</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.180" end="00:19:52.250" style="s2">you like get your life back on track</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:56.510" style="s2">and keep yourself alive and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.250" end="00:19:58.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a and there&#39;s there&#39;s a magic in</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.510" end="00:20:03.320" style="s2">there there&#39;s a certain amount of magic</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.309" end="00:20:05.929" style="s2">that happens in that space that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.320" end="00:20:11.480" style="s2">because yeah if if you have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.929" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">women like what you know like a a has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.480" end="00:20:16.250" style="s2">has a purpose it hasn&#39;t you know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">know one of the traditions our primary</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.250" end="00:20:22.070" style="s2">purpose is to stay sober and help other</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:25.190" style="s2">alcoholics that&#39;s you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.070" end="00:20:28.190" style="s2">our purpose is and so but like in these</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.190" end="00:20:32.299" style="s2">other groups like not having that clear</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.190" end="00:20:36.950" style="s2">purpose and in not having a clear</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.299" end="00:20:40.220" style="s2">purpose and being difficult to have any</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.950" end="00:20:41.390" style="s2">sense of direction nothing to curate</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.220" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">right there&#39;s no purpose and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.390" end="00:20:45.409" style="s2">nothing to curate that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:48.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole thing exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.409" end="00:20:50.990" style="s2">that shared sense of this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.260" end="00:20:53.419" style="s2">trying to do and you know preserving</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.990" end="00:20:55.549" style="s2">that whatever that thing is I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.419" end="00:20:56.990" style="s2">that case in your instance it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.549" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">yeah what would at that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.990" end="00:21:00.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what curation centers around</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.380" style="s2">right is recognizing what the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.830" end="00:21:06.890" style="s2">and seeking to preserve it and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.380" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">it which i think is where we can go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.890" end="00:21:13.159" style="s2">for the foundation is like survival and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">creating his trading game be is also</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.159" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">about survival the issue is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:22.190" style="s2">have sobriety as the thing right like</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:23.960" style="s2">we&#39;re not like we all have a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.190" end="00:21:26.659" style="s2">idea what the first step is towards game</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.960" end="00:21:28.370" style="s2">being let alone what game he is even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.659" end="00:21:31.309" style="s2">actually we might agree with what game</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.370" end="00:21:33.020" style="s2">he is and it&#39;s somewhat utopian society</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.309" end="00:21:34.280" style="s2">we don&#39;t agree with how to get there we</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.020" end="00:21:35.570" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with the first step and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.280" end="00:21:37.070" style="s2">don&#39;t even really agree with what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.570" end="00:21:39.110" style="s2">looks like because of all the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.070" end="00:21:41.270" style="s2">that we can&#39;t see in our own our own</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.110" end="00:21:45.830" style="s2">vision but if we were to approach it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.270" end="00:21:47.870" style="s2">from like a 12 step program that game a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.830" end="00:21:50.270" style="s2">is what we&#39;re all addicted to even if</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.870" end="00:21:52.700" style="s2">we&#39;d want it gone I ain&#39;t like we know</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.270" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">it has this horrible impact on our lives</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.700" end="00:21:58.760" style="s2">in the lives of others can we show up</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:22:00.590" style="s2">have the conversations in order to move</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.760" end="00:22:02.870" style="s2">it forward and that&#39;s it right just have</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.590" end="00:22:04.679" style="s2">the conversations curate that curate</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.870" end="00:22:06.269" style="s2">that how you find a group</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.679" end="00:22:07.710" style="s2">and what are the bare minimum of rules</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.269" end="00:22:09.960" style="s2">to be part of that group so that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.710" end="00:22:12.419" style="s2">group itself can come up with more more</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.960" end="00:22:13.950" style="s2">rules right like if I&#39;m in any town and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.419" end="00:22:15.419" style="s2">I need an a a meeting I can find out</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.950" end="00:22:17.309" style="s2">where the closest one is that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.419" end="00:22:20.759" style="s2">happen without a central authority right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.309" end="00:22:22.379" style="s2">but it does but what I mean is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.759" end="00:22:23.879" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like you need to have some kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.379" end="00:22:28.440" style="s2">of curation of that right otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.879" end="00:22:30.330" style="s2">where do I go to find out yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.440" end="00:22:32.549" style="s2">like there&#39;s an app that was built by</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.330" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">somebody you know just by by someone who</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.549" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">like you know collected all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:39.539" style="s2">information from the various you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:42.119" style="s2">because each disk knew there&#39;s districts</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.539" end="00:22:45.269" style="s2">and each district has a central office</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.119" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">and and so there is some manner of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.269" end="00:22:50.039" style="s2">organization but it&#39;s very very loose if</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:51.720" style="s2">someone&#39;s still going to put it on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.039" end="00:22:53.340" style="s2">database or and take them off when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.720" end="00:22:54.389" style="s2">groups disband and when you go and put</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.340" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">them on you know I mean there there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.389" end="00:22:58.679" style="s2">still a level of curation involved by</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:00.869" style="s2">someone write some somehow someone has</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.679" end="00:23:04.379" style="s2">to do all that shit well and it&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.869" end="00:23:07.169" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.379" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">know again I bring the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.169" end="00:23:13.259" style="s2">have learned to the game be things to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.610" style="s2">the game be space and it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.259" end="00:23:16.409" style="s2">are certain fundamental things that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:19.139" style="s2">learn that that you learn and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.409" end="00:23:21.570" style="s2">twelve-step and like it&#39;s like things</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.139" end="00:23:24.210" style="s2">like one day at a time what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.570" end="00:23:25.649" style="s2">indicated you know in a a they say</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.210" end="00:23:26.940" style="s2">what&#39;s the next right action but I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.649" end="00:23:28.350" style="s2">never deal with that because I could</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.940" end="00:23:30.690" style="s2">never hit figure out what was the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.350" end="00:23:32.850" style="s2">thing to do so I said what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.690" end="00:23:36.749" style="s2">indicated action and you know dealing</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.850" end="00:23:39.299" style="s2">with okay what&#39;s happening today and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.749" end="00:23:42.149" style="s2">do you do that collectively as a group</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.299" end="00:23:44.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a lot of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.149" end="00:23:45.809" style="s2">figure out okay how do we get to the top</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.340" end="00:23:49.470" style="s2">of the mountain but we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.809" end="00:23:51.899" style="s2">how to take a first step and like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.470" end="00:23:55.289" style="s2">when I came when I came in I had I had a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.899" end="00:23:56.549" style="s2">mentor who just he kept telling me stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.289" end="00:23:57.330" style="s2">looking at the top of the mountain look</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.549" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">down at your feet</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.330" end="00:24:01.769" style="s2">where are your feet he&#39;s like over and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:03.149" style="s2">over again cuz I kept going I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.769" end="00:24:05.129" style="s2">how to figure anything out like I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.149" end="00:24:07.860" style="s2">just completely crazy and I had no idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.129" end="00:24:09.389" style="s2">how to figure out how to get from where</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.860" end="00:24:12.149" style="s2">I was to where I thought I was supposed</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.389" end="00:24:15.990" style="s2">to be or and it was like okay just focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.149" end="00:24:17.650" style="s2">on where you are and but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.990" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">how but it&#39;s like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.650" end="00:24:25.720" style="s2">you that collectively a proposal I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:31.980" style="s2">suggest that we call what cure is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.720" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">talking about curation Oh which aspect</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.980" end="00:24:52.420" style="s2">curation like there is it sure not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:55.030" style="s2">truth you let&#39;s aim it after but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.420" end="00:24:57.400" style="s2">that focusing where you are instead of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.030" end="00:24:58.630" style="s2">where you need to get to it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.400" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">kind of know around where you want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.630" end="00:25:02.050" style="s2">get to but then if you&#39;re so focused on</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.660" style="s2">the destination then you can&#39;t take the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.050" end="00:25:06.760" style="s2">first step and you also don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.660" end="00:25:08.530" style="s2">all the ways you have to go like this to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.760" end="00:25:12.280" style="s2">get there right it&#39;s like oh this is off</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.530" end="00:25:14.230" style="s2">the path and this is and in truly owning</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.280" end="00:25:16.180" style="s2">that we all just need to see where our</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.230" end="00:25:18.490" style="s2">feet are right where are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.180" end="00:25:21.280" style="s2">it also for me anyway it helps me have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.490" end="00:25:24.010" style="s2">lot more compassion for where anybody is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.280" end="00:25:25.900" style="s2">because it&#39;s not about them getting to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.010" end="00:25:28.420" style="s2">the destination I may feel I want them</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.900" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">to get to it&#39;s about where they actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.420" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">are and seeing them helping them GPS</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">that right like let&#39;s figure out where</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:39.150" style="s2">you are and then where do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">get to if that&#39;s even a thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.150" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">know yeah right well your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">collective curation mmm curation is</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:50.890" style="s2">without knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:53.800" style="s2">yeah a lot along the lines of the bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.890" end="00:25:57.580" style="s2">joke I just made I think the difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.800" end="00:25:59.620" style="s2">is between like just you know cataloging</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.580" end="00:26:01.930" style="s2">a bunch of related stuff under a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.620" end="00:26:05.340" style="s2">theme which is a kind of typical notion</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.930" end="00:26:10.090" style="s2">of curation like with art mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.340" end="00:26:11.620" style="s2">organizing information or content in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.090" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">similar way but to have more of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.620" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">transform a transformative effect right</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.250" end="00:26:21.910" style="s2">so mm-hmm it&#39;s just trying to index ting</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:26.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t that just indexing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.910" end="00:26:28.140" style="s2">talking about indexing would be just</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.230" end="00:26:30.300" style="s2">more like</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.140" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">choosing an index according the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.300" end="00:26:37.980" style="s2">information better wouldn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:41.550" style="s2">affect the kind of guidelines for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.980" end="00:26:45.180" style="s2">collected I guess but like I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.550" end="00:26:47.850" style="s2">not doing the point justice but you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.180" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">along the lines of what what what</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.850" end="00:26:51.780" style="s2">they&#39;re saying to about game a is like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.060" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get over the game an</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.780" end="00:26:56.520" style="s2">addiction it can have parallels with AAA</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.060" end="00:26:59.720" style="s2">like that I think that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.520" end="00:27:03.080" style="s2">because you&#39;re not just you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.720" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">curating you know information about</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.080" end="00:27:10.410" style="s2">alcohol or whatever systems change in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:13.350" style="s2">this case like there&#39;s an actual goal</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.410" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s a process we have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.350" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">together and commit commit to together</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:22.200" style="s2">because like if we take it as seriously</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:27.590" style="s2">as as a getting rid of this game a a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.200" end="00:27:30.450" style="s2">kind of pathology or cancer or addiction</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.590" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">of course it&#39;s much more complex so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:35.580" style="s2">have to curate and weed out kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:39.210" style="s2">what the what the patterns are within us</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.580" end="00:27:40.950" style="s2">that that has become so normalized and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.210" end="00:27:43.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens with with drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.950" end="00:27:46.140" style="s2">alcohol to is you just kind of lose</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.020" end="00:27:48.780" style="s2">sight of the context and in which all</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.140" end="00:27:49.710" style="s2">this stuff is happening you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.780" end="00:27:54.780" style="s2">think there&#39;s something to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.710" end="00:27:58.830" style="s2">this kind of a curation where where we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.780" end="00:28:00.930" style="s2">kind of look you know look to the goal</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.830" end="00:28:05.480" style="s2">and look beyond our present problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.930" end="00:28:07.980" style="s2">with with getting there and like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.480" end="00:28:13.350" style="s2">again in the sense of a like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.980" end="00:28:14.850" style="s2">subordinate yourself to to the process</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.350" end="00:28:16.500" style="s2">and whatever whatever feelings you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.850" end="00:28:19.110" style="s2">have liked it like it must be very</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.500" end="00:28:20.940" style="s2">difficult right so you have to work</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.110" end="00:28:24.660" style="s2">through the internal stuff and also just</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.940" end="00:28:32.270" style="s2">the kind of external physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.660" end="00:28:32.270" style="s2">based stuff that creates that addiction</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.310" end="00:28:39.030" style="s2">I also really like that frame of game a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.930" end="00:28:40.800" style="s2">as an addiction right and treat it as</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.030" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">you would do addiction to alcohol or</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.800" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">drugs or sex or whatever in a 12-step</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:49.290" style="s2">program I really like that frame the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:51.450" style="s2">problem with it is the alcohol addiction</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.290" end="00:28:52.920" style="s2">for example is really it&#39;s a simple</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.450" end="00:28:55.410" style="s2">thing right you&#39;re addicted to alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.920" end="00:28:57.390" style="s2">you know you&#39;re addicted to alcohol you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.410" end="00:29:00.330" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.390" end="00:29:03.080" style="s2">whereas game a is not a simple thing in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.330" end="00:29:05.490" style="s2">the same way as Brent said you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.080" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">in order for it to work in a 12-step</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.490" end="00:29:08.730" style="s2">kind of way in order to have it to Kleck</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:11.820" style="s2">the clarity and the power that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.730" end="00:29:14.070" style="s2">simplicity of you know stay sober right</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.820" end="00:29:15.450" style="s2">stay at Sobers say alive keep your life</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.070" end="00:29:18.030" style="s2">together you know that the simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.450" end="00:29:19.950" style="s2">and power of that is lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.030" end="00:29:22.950" style="s2">complexity of game a there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.950" end="00:29:24.750" style="s2">thing that you can point to to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.950" end="00:29:26.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what I have to stop doing or</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.750" end="00:29:30.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what I need to start doing right</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.280" end="00:29:39.060" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s much much much more busy</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.390" end="00:29:43.980" style="s2">and complex than that well on the one</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.060" end="00:29:47.940" style="s2">hand I agree with you that you you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.980" end="00:29:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not as simple as you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.940" end="00:29:51.690" style="s2">having a 30 day without you know 30 days</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.920" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">without buying something you know how</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.690" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">many years have I been sober from Game a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.300" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">it is not it I don&#39;t think it is nearly</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.230" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">as simple for someone who&#39;s an alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.490" end="00:30:16.620" style="s2">of I&#39;m an alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.660" end="00:30:19.290" style="s2">like it takes years for them to for</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.620" end="00:30:21.300" style="s2">people to work through all of the so</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.290" end="00:30:28.290" style="s2">easy I said simple they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.300" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">different things right yeah but but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.290" end="00:30:35.940" style="s2">the aspect of coming to the realization</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:39.210" style="s2">of what is what what is it that I am</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.940" end="00:30:43.590" style="s2">actually but you know what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.210" end="00:30:45.140" style="s2">that is causing the the problem and in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.590" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">lot of cases</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.140" end="00:30:53.210" style="s2">it&#39;s there you know alcohol is what a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">symptom of the problem and part of part</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.210" end="00:30:58.970" style="s2">of a a is taking an inventory and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:03.890" style="s2">starting to recognize oh I&#39;m addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.970" end="00:31:05.180" style="s2">the drama I&#39;m addicted to absolutely get</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.890" end="00:31:07.100" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying so what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.180" end="00:31:09.050" style="s2">equivalent of alcohol in this analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.100" end="00:31:11.960" style="s2">for game a what would be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:14.380" style="s2">we do in game a which isn&#39;t the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:17.780" style="s2">itself but is the symptom of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.380" end="00:31:23.180" style="s2">one of the things I would say is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.780" end="00:31:24.650" style="s2">addiction to certainty okay is I need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.180" end="00:31:28.760" style="s2">know that you know I need to have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.650" end="00:31:31.340" style="s2">sense of certainty and at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.760" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">that that was the first that was the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.340" end="00:31:36.230" style="s2">first word that popped into my head when</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:38.120" style="s2">you yeah what about the rest of you what</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.230" end="00:31:40.430" style="s2">would be you know if we&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.120" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">that frame and so the problem isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.430" end="00:31:43.750" style="s2">actually in addiction to alcohol that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:46.490" style="s2">a symptom of the problem but what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.750" end="00:31:48.380" style="s2">what is the equivalent of the drinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.490" end="00:31:50.420" style="s2">too much alcohol what&#39;s the what&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.380" end="00:31:53.330" style="s2">you the one symptom of game a that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.420" end="00:31:55.310" style="s2">obviously game a from unit comes with</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:59.900" style="s2">certainty it&#39;s judgements judgments of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.310" end="00:32:02.690" style="s2">others and judgments of myself if I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.900" end="00:32:04.760" style="s2">to just kind of copy the the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.690" end="00:32:06.610" style="s2">here I would say rationality right</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.760" end="00:32:10.520" style="s2">because cuz we&#39;re talking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.610" end="00:32:12.470" style="s2">abstractions and like the idea of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.520" end="00:32:15.190" style="s2">know critical theory is largely the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.470" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">heads you know reason and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.190" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">taken to it&#39;s absurd conclusion is is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">totalitarianism so we we see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:22.700" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:24.650" style="s2">it&#39;s called instrumental reason right</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.700" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">apply throughout the 20th century that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.650" end="00:32:30.800" style="s2">it&#39;s you know scientific thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">like doesn&#39;t have moral ends necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.800" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:37.970" style="s2">but but aside from that abstraction like</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:41.450" style="s2">of course concretely people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.970" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">addiction to oil and that&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.450" end="00:32:47.420" style="s2">kind of individual addiction like it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:49.970" style="s2">a dependency that we&#39;ve created but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.420" end="00:32:52.490" style="s2">also like it&#39;s not apt enough to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">of it as a personal addiction because</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.490" end="00:32:58.040" style="s2">it&#39;s so instrumental and in fact rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:32:59.030" style="s2">than internalizing the costs like with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.040" end="00:33:01.640" style="s2">Al</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.030" end="00:33:04.910" style="s2">or smoking which are also externalize</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.640" end="00:33:08.750" style="s2">but with oil it&#39;s mostly externalize you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.910" end="00:33:11.330" style="s2">know it&#39;s negative externalities so uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.750" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re addicted to fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.330" end="00:33:16.730" style="s2">right and this is a macro you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:19.040" style="s2">cultural addiction that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.730" end="00:33:22.300" style="s2">wrestling with for decades and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.040" end="00:33:25.220" style="s2">you know all the questions come up like</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:27.560" style="s2">okay we we know this is the case now</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.220" end="00:33:30.050" style="s2">what do we do how do we commit to an</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.560" end="00:33:33.130" style="s2">alternative etc right and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.050" end="00:33:33.130" style="s2">taking a lot longer than it should</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.280" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">I&#39;d like to bring it right I appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.910" end="00:33:43.130" style="s2">what you said there and this what came</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">up for me is sort of another frame that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.130" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">comes from again the a a world which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.650" end="00:33:54.230" style="s2">recognizing that something that was at</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">one point a tool now be now no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.230" end="00:34:00.350" style="s2">being a tool so for most people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:03.710" style="s2">alcoholics alcohol at one point served</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.350" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">like a purpose of it it made them looser</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.710" end="00:34:07.820" style="s2">it made it you know it helps them deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:12.530" style="s2">with anxiety it&#39;s a self medicate you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.820" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">know it&#39;s a self medicating and how and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.530" end="00:34:23.290" style="s2">then at a certain point it becomes a you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:26.810" style="s2">know something that was a tool becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.290" end="00:34:28.250" style="s2">detriment and and that and its Brent</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.810" end="00:34:30.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what I thought of when you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.250" end="00:34:35.690" style="s2">thought of that but I up but what I also</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.310" end="00:34:39.379" style="s2">thought of was okay if we thought of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.690" end="00:34:43.159" style="s2">dependency on fossil fuel as a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.379" end="00:34:44.899" style="s2">what are the things underneath that like</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.159" end="00:34:47.360" style="s2">I thought of okay what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.899" end="00:34:51.250" style="s2">that fossil fuel facilitates it fossil</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.360" end="00:34:56.510" style="s2">it facilitates travel and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.250" end="00:34:59.330" style="s2">like does the does are does releasing</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.330" end="00:35:05.970" style="s2">mean we don&#39;t from stop traveling like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.670" end="00:35:09.540" style="s2">or you know how yeah</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.819" end="00:35:28.829" style="s2">courage to do yeah and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.349" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">like also framing it as an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.829" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">like the 12-step program is mainly for I</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:36.630" style="s2">believe abstinence type addictions right</p>

<p begin="00:35:51.180" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">what&#39;s called a process addiction like</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:59.810" style="s2">anorexia would be considered a process</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:03.750" style="s2">addiction SLA which is sex love</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:13.020" style="s2">without sex but it&#39;s changing your but</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.220" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s changing your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.020" end="00:36:20.540" style="s2">to it and then al-anon which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">sister program to AAA which is the like</p>

<p begin="00:36:39.780" end="00:36:46.829" style="s2">concrete thing but it&#39;s like being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.260" end="00:36:51.540" style="s2">the process of recovery and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.829" end="00:36:53.730" style="s2">game B is a process of recovering some</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.540" end="00:36:56.339" style="s2">things that we used to have that we like</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.730" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">Eric what you talked about and initially</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.339" end="00:37:02.490" style="s2">of you know being conditioned to look</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:04.050" style="s2">for a leader I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.050" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">been the case and that and recovering</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.140" end="00:37:12.750" style="s2">that ability for collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:14.990" style="s2">that I think might have it that I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.750" end="00:37:17.160" style="s2">might have existed in the past so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.990" end="00:37:19.330" style="s2">don&#39;t that answers your question Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.160" end="00:37:21.070" style="s2">yeah no and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.330" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t realize there was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.070" end="00:37:25.660" style="s2">distinction a process addiction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.940" style="s2">what we need right because it&#39;s we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.660" end="00:37:29.140" style="s2">just like take away we can&#39;t just take</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.940" end="00:37:31.270" style="s2">away our need for certainty or</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.140" end="00:37:34.060" style="s2">leadership or I don&#39;t know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.270" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">but to own it in ourselves well at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.060" end="00:37:38.920" style="s2">same time allowing that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:42.270" style="s2">responsible for anybody else&#39;s sobriety</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.920" end="00:37:44.500" style="s2">which even I know I&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.270" end="00:37:46.210" style="s2">responsible for like I&#39;m like I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.500" end="00:37:48.010" style="s2">to save the entire world looking if</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.210" end="00:37:51.370" style="s2">they&#39;re like I am responsible for all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.010" end="00:37:52.990" style="s2">it and it&#39;s like both owning that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.370" end="00:37:54.820" style="s2">not owning it at the same time that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.990" end="00:37:56.980" style="s2">not all on me it&#39;s not mine and at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.820" end="00:37:59.140" style="s2">same time how I do that is by</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.980" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">concentrating on mine a constraint on my</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.140" end="00:38:03.730" style="s2">addictions and what I can do about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:06.700" style="s2">feelings and sensations in my body and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.730" end="00:38:08.170" style="s2">my actions while hopefully helping other</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.700" end="00:38:11.860" style="s2">people do that as well because it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.170" end="00:38:20.020" style="s2">like a group thing that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.860" end="00:38:23.490" style="s2">through yeah we somewhat strayed from</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.020" end="00:38:26.470" style="s2">the initial point of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.490" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">which was how does one go about laying</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.470" end="00:38:34.750" style="s2">the stats for collective curation I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:36.250" style="s2">got a related point I just it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.750" end="00:38:41.020" style="s2">popped in my head earlier and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.250" end="00:38:43.720" style="s2">it&#39;s relevant there&#39;s there&#39;s a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.020" end="00:38:46.810" style="s2">group I forget the exact name it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.720" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">manda modern art and philosophy possibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.810" end="00:38:53.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s curated mm-hmm in</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.420" style="s2">in in the best sense of the word by a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.620" end="00:38:59.380" style="s2">guy named David O&#39;Donoghue and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.420" end="00:39:02.530" style="s2">philosopher from Iowa and a bunch of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.380" end="00:39:08.110" style="s2">actually met him in Kiev it was a a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.530" end="00:39:10.060" style="s2">interesting cross-fertilization and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.110" end="00:39:11.890" style="s2">he curates a lot of meta modern art</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.060" end="00:39:13.960" style="s2">great and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.890" end="00:39:15.730" style="s2">see for a long time but it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.960" end="00:39:18.970" style="s2">thing to curate like what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.730" end="00:39:22.390" style="s2">what is Matt a modern art and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.970" end="00:39:26.440" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s whatever whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.390" end="00:39:28.780" style="s2">curator says it says it is you know but</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.440" end="00:39:29.650" style="s2">but there&#39;s been a lot of lot of super</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.780" end="00:39:32.740" style="s2">just gorgeous</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.650" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">interesting thought-provoking art posted</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.740" end="00:39:35.470" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:36.910" style="s2">and on a regular basis too so that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.470" end="00:39:41.260" style="s2">takes a lot of time and effort you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.910" end="00:39:45.510" style="s2">and I curate various things but nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.260" end="00:39:50.170" style="s2">to that degree and with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.510" end="00:39:53.110" style="s2">consistency so I appreciate that but</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.170" end="00:39:54.970" style="s2">it&#39;s also interesting because because I</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.110" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">clash with David over politics because</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.970" end="00:40:03.100" style="s2">he&#39;s in Iowa and he wanted to UM caucus</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:05.260" style="s2">for Pete Budaj edge and and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.100" end="00:40:08.620" style="s2">saying for months like butta judge is</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.260" end="00:40:10.980" style="s2">not gonna pan out he&#39;s not he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.620" end="00:40:13.270" style="s2">neo liberal candidates very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.980" end="00:40:14.740" style="s2">centrist very moderate it&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.270" end="00:40:17.410" style="s2">seen before it&#39;s not what people want</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.740" end="00:40:23.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s easy to get wrapped up in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:24.940" style="s2">Pete&#39;s rhetoric and Obama energy but but</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.500" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">you know Pete&#39;s curating a certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.940" end="00:40:32.470" style="s2">political message and I don&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:34.030" style="s2">people don&#39;t agree with it and so it</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.470" end="00:40:35.710" style="s2">just goes to the point of curation like</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.030" end="00:40:38.670" style="s2">we can we can curate different things</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.710" end="00:40:43.630" style="s2">but then people have will have different</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.670" end="00:40:47.140" style="s2">opinions in different topics right so on</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.630" end="00:40:49.660" style="s2">the whole I think I think David</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.140" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">O&#39;Donoghue and I like like get along and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.660" end="00:40:55.480" style="s2">and and share good information on this</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:57.250" style="s2">topic but I just I think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.480" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">interesting like because he&#39;s curated a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.250" end="00:41:04.840" style="s2">lot of great art so people should go</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:08.410" style="s2">check that out and kind of think think</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.840" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">of what it means to have good curation</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.410" end="00:41:12.910" style="s2">but also think of the weaknesses we all</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:14.980" style="s2">have in the contradictions and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.910" end="00:41:19.600" style="s2">different topics and different types of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.980" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">content and and what information we keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.600" end="00:41:24.580" style="s2">alive and perpetuate when we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:26.200" style="s2">to curate because I see people curating</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.580" end="00:41:30.390" style="s2">lots of different political views which</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.200" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">of course I find hostile to to to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.390" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">progressive movements and and to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:41.810" style="s2">better sense making in politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">so and I guess I guess to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.810" end="00:41:45.589" style="s2">people can give David feedback on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:47.089" style="s2">art and then it becomes a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.589" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">collective process too because I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.089" end="00:41:50.990" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna shoot in the dark tube it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:55.869" style="s2">just it&#39;s just amazing to see the art</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.990" end="00:41:58.220" style="s2">you know isn&#39;t it between curation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.869" end="00:41:59.390" style="s2">censorship right there&#39;s potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.220" end="00:42:02.869" style="s2">fine line there when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">curation in that sense sorry can I sorry</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.869" end="00:42:05.390" style="s2">Jubilee I know you&#39;ve got something to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.790" style="s2">say well just that something popped into</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.390" end="00:42:10.040" style="s2">my head as brent was talking as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.790" end="00:42:11.810" style="s2">source of step towards collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.040" end="00:42:15.349" style="s2">curating and I&#39;m thinking in particular</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:28.820" style="s2">and yeah there seems to be anyway so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:30.650" style="s2">was thinking something along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.820" end="00:42:33.320" style="s2">of if you&#39;re gonna do collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.650" end="00:42:35.270" style="s2">curation then you can&#39;t have one person</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.320" end="00:42:37.400" style="s2">saying yeah this is this is appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.270" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">this is not appropriate so how about</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.400" end="00:42:40.970" style="s2">something along the lines of there was</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:44.030" style="s2">guidance from the moderators that said</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.970" end="00:42:47.510" style="s2">something like posts that you think are</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.030" end="00:42:49.820" style="s2">unhelpful or whatever ignore them right</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.510" end="00:42:51.470" style="s2">don&#39;t chat just ignore them and posts</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.470" end="00:42:56.720" style="s2">developing make an effort to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.589" end="00:42:58.070" style="s2">them in order to upregulate and what if</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.720" end="00:43:00.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve got guidance from the moderators</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.070" end="00:43:02.869" style="s2">along along those lines to actually use</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.050" end="00:43:05.030" style="s2">the Facebook algorithm to so try as its</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.869" end="00:43:07.160" style="s2">you know to shine a light on the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.030" end="00:43:09.770" style="s2">that&#39;s good and ignore the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.160" end="00:43:11.210" style="s2">bad and that&#39;s no one person&#39;s decision</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.770" end="00:43:12.890" style="s2">to decide what&#39;s good and bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.210" end="00:43:14.869" style="s2">that&#39;s the group&#39;s decision to decide</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.690" end="00:43:21.320" style="s2">because of the algorithm the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.160" end="00:43:23.980" style="s2">how do you even get that into people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.320" end="00:43:25.970" style="s2">minds because how do you curate that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.980" end="00:43:28.700" style="s2">things to the group right if an</p>

<p begin="00:47:19.100" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">it because it triggers our heartstrings</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.510" end="00:47:23.540" style="s2">and at the same time that could be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">exact opposite of what is needed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.540" end="00:47:29.660" style="s2">like all the anyway um we have our part</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.300" end="00:48:04.580" style="s2">have a certain there&#39;s a couple of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.060" end="00:48:07.670" style="s2">that that will bother me and cause me to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.580" end="00:48:15.170" style="s2">to say cause me to stop and comment and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.670" end="00:48:17.390" style="s2">some of those are things like lots of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.170" end="00:48:19.369" style="s2">comparisons of the United States to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.390" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">Scandinavian countries those bug the</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.980" style="s2">because if you look at the populate I</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.870" end="00:48:34.390" style="s2">but to take those and compare try and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.270" end="00:48:38.120" style="s2">compare them just seems like</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.390" end="00:48:39.770" style="s2">preposterous to me and and so I will</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.120" end="00:48:41.330" style="s2">comment but there&#39;s also one of like</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.770" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">there&#39;s this particular meme that goes</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.330" end="00:48:48.950" style="s2">around about people being absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:51.110" style="s2">horrified about Social Security being</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.950" end="00:48:53.290" style="s2">called an entitlement and like I am</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.110" end="00:48:55.460" style="s2">somebody whose literal about words and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.290" end="00:48:56.780" style="s2">entitled that was what it was originally</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.460" end="00:48:58.490" style="s2">called when it was originally really</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.780" end="00:48:59.600" style="s2">when it was originally created when</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.490" end="00:49:05.720" style="s2">Social Security and Medicare were</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.600" end="00:49:07.820" style="s2">originally created because you because</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.720" end="00:49:10.580" style="s2">if you qualified you were entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.820" end="00:49:12.050" style="s2">the funds but everybody takes it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.580" end="00:49:13.490" style="s2">here&#39;s the word entitlement and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.050" end="00:49:15.110" style="s2">think that it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.490" end="00:49:17.450" style="s2">you know oh it&#39;s something that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.110" end="00:49:19.400" style="s2">owed and like so it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.450" end="00:49:21.470" style="s2">that the things that we like will go</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.400" end="00:49:23.210" style="s2">into in-depth research about those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.470" end="00:49:26.120" style="s2">two things that I just have this like</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.210" end="00:49:29.240" style="s2">Bugaboo about but like anytime somebody</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.120" end="00:49:32.780" style="s2">posts them I like feel almost compelled</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.240" end="00:49:34.010" style="s2">to go there I can make your comments to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.780" end="00:49:35.720" style="s2">me is something like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.010" end="00:49:38.210" style="s2">necessarily this job like the collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.720" end="00:49:39.950" style="s2">curation yet it is like you think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.210" end="00:49:41.810" style="s2">curating the museum and what we were</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.950" end="00:49:43.220" style="s2">saying about like then it is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.810" end="00:49:45.470" style="s2">collection and it&#39;s really just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.220" end="00:49:49.130" style="s2">database but in a museum in a physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.470" end="00:49:50.870" style="s2">space this fossil has to be somewhere so</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.130" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">is it based on the time period is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.870" end="00:49:53.960" style="s2">based on the geography is it based on</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.490" end="00:49:55.910" style="s2">that like what is it actually based on</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.960" end="00:49:57.230" style="s2">whereas online on the internet we</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.910" end="00:49:58.970" style="s2">actually can have this same thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.230" end="00:50:00.590" style="s2">categorized as many different things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.970" end="00:50:02.300" style="s2">if you don&#39;t like it you categorize it</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.590" end="00:50:06.140" style="s2">as something different that we need a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.300" end="00:50:07.670" style="s2">new way to curate current events a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.140" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">to curate it so it&#39;s like what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.670" end="00:50:11.210" style="s2">happening how do we know it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.730" style="s2">why is it happening and like all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.210" end="00:50:15.980" style="s2">those things get met mangled up and like</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.730" end="00:50:17.510" style="s2">the media&#39;s the one reports on it then</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.980" end="00:50:19.220" style="s2">we have the conversation and then they</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.510" end="00:50:20.900" style="s2">just need clickbait titles it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.220" end="00:50:22.610" style="s2">I want to know what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.900" end="00:50:24.170" style="s2">like the thing with Trump I want the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.610" end="00:50:25.790" style="s2">whole timeline of everything he&#39;s said</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.170" end="00:50:27.590" style="s2">from the environment pro and con right</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.790" end="00:50:30.080" style="s2">not said sorry actually be cleared into</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.590" end="00:50:33.050" style="s2">being and like to be able to curate that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.080" end="00:50:35.210" style="s2">is more of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.050" end="00:50:36.590" style="s2">a app right it&#39;s actually putting the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.210" end="00:50:37.820" style="s2">information in but someone has to put</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.590" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">the information in and we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.820" end="00:50:42.350" style="s2">the conversation about what gets what</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.910" style="s2">gets in and what doesn&#39;t get in and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.350" end="00:50:48.560" style="s2">mean I think everything but it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.910" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">be the UM word like boundary for is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.560" end="00:50:51.770" style="s2">real or not right is it if it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:54.740" style="s2">science is an impure food journal if</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.770" end="00:50:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s for in events was it validated by</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.740" end="00:50:58.820" style="s2">multiple cameras at the same time all</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.350" end="00:51:01.130" style="s2">with the same GPS coordinates or</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.820" end="00:51:03.080" style="s2">something that is a higher level and</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">then be able to understand why did this</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.080" end="00:51:07.670" style="s2">happen and we can have more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">conversations but like what happens how</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.670" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">do we know what happens and curating</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:16.340" style="s2">that kind of thing well I and I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:18.260" style="s2">actually that&#39;s like a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.340" end="00:51:22.070" style="s2">of the of the collective curation of if</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.260" end="00:51:26.330" style="s2">somebody posts something that is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.070" end="00:51:28.220" style="s2">know like we weather weather Snopes is</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.330" end="00:51:30.980" style="s2">reliable or not or politifact you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.220" end="00:51:32.780" style="s2">each one of those it&#39;s like hey I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.980" end="00:51:34.760" style="s2">this counterpoint you know I have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.780" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">other piece of information that said</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.760" end="00:51:39.530" style="s2">that goes into more detail about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:41.630" style="s2">particular you know here&#39;s this here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.530" end="00:51:44.450" style="s2">this explanation of why this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.630" end="00:51:46.250" style="s2">the way it is not to not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.450" end="00:51:50.900" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong but here&#39;s some more</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.250" end="00:51:53.030" style="s2">information and so how we like and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.900" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">who do we you know who do we trust our</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.030" end="00:51:59.320" style="s2">sense making to you know bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:52:03.340" style="s2">in because I mean I think curation is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.320" end="00:52:09.290" style="s2">just an aspect of sense making like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.340" end="00:52:14.030" style="s2">and and who do I trust in my son&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.290" end="00:52:18.560" style="s2">making can I just say like like one one</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.030" end="00:52:21.560" style="s2">of I think the strengths of Game me is</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.560" end="00:52:25.700" style="s2">its initial kind of curation because</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.560" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">like if you can find the links and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.700" end="00:52:30.410" style="s2">whatnot you know you can trace back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:32.870" style="s2">like a game be wiki and and posts with</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.410" end="00:52:35.150" style="s2">like book lists and stuff so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.870" end="00:52:38.870" style="s2">quite a lot there it&#39;s been kind of pre</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.150" end="00:52:40.790" style="s2">curated and I think that&#39;s its strengths</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.870" end="00:52:43.940" style="s2">I think a lot it can be has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.790" end="00:52:45.819" style="s2">flaws and and some of that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.940" end="00:52:48.069" style="s2">with curation and some of it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.819" end="00:52:50.709" style="s2">kind of protocols in the way people talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.069" end="00:52:54.009" style="s2">to each other which is good on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.709" end="00:52:57.160" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s supposed to generate</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.009" end="00:53:00.789" style="s2">sort of progress and solve issues but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.160" end="00:53:04.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s also curated some brat some</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.789" end="00:53:08.709" style="s2">bad practices in but I also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.119" end="00:53:11.109" style="s2">say like with with meta modernism I put</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.709" end="00:53:13.799" style="s2">together a big spreadsheet with as many</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.109" end="00:53:16.119" style="s2">sources I could find right and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.799" end="00:53:17.979" style="s2">it&#39;s not a pure example of curation</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.119" end="00:53:21.640" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have it that tagged it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.979" end="00:53:23.079" style="s2">just a list if I had more time and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.640" end="00:53:25.569" style="s2">and nobody else has done this either</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.079" end="00:53:28.959" style="s2">like it was a lot of work to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.569" end="00:53:30.819" style="s2">that point and and my incentive was to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.959" end="00:53:32.650" style="s2">kind of serve people&#39;s research</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.819" end="00:53:34.209" style="s2">interests right so if you need to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.650" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">research then there is something already</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.209" end="00:53:39.789" style="s2">sort of curated there and that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:41.739" style="s2">think it should be done but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.789" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">kind of an unfinished project for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.739" end="00:53:46.029" style="s2">right because I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t tagged</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">at everything and so if I was to curate</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.029" end="00:53:50.229" style="s2">it more I would go through it more in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:51.849" style="s2">depth and tag and you know put put meta</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.229" end="00:53:56.440" style="s2">tags and stuff and and help people</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.849" end="00:53:59.229" style="s2">navigate that information but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.440" end="00:54:00.759" style="s2">a work in progress still I know that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.229" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">don&#39;t have a ton of time left but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.759" end="00:54:08.410" style="s2">realized I wanted to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:10.059" style="s2">what what does this group cliff see as</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.410" end="00:54:15.160" style="s2">the difference between curation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.059" end="00:54:17.739" style="s2">sense and and sense making I think to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.160" end="00:54:21.910" style="s2">the searchers came up was that curation</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.739" end="00:54:24.940" style="s2">is like the collection and organization</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.910" end="00:54:26.589" style="s2">of the information that is still not</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.940" end="00:54:28.660" style="s2">black and white but is much more black</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.589" end="00:54:30.309" style="s2">and white than this sense making which</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.660" end="00:54:31.690" style="s2">is what do I make sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.309" end="00:54:34.420" style="s2">information or how do we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.690" end="00:54:36.099" style="s2">make sense of it so be like pool of data</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.420" end="00:54:37.239" style="s2">we need to agree what kind of goes in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.099" end="00:54:38.949" style="s2">there to a certain degree what makes</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.239" end="00:54:40.719" style="s2">something valid and not where is my</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.949" end="00:54:42.849" style="s2">sense making you don&#39;t actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.719" end="00:54:44.949" style="s2">agree with even though it absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.849" end="00:54:46.420" style="s2">affects you right what I choose to put</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.949" end="00:54:48.489" style="s2">in my body what I choose to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.420" end="00:54:51.099" style="s2">world is going to affect you in at the</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.099" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">pool of data that I&#39;ve based it on since</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.529" end="00:54:58.680" style="s2">makings mine and the curations more</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.730" end="00:55:11.550" style="s2">think Kira and I are fairly closely in</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:15.480" style="s2">line have very different flavors if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.550" end="00:55:17.270" style="s2">like for the word curation and so Brent</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.480" end="00:55:21.720" style="s2">it seems has a sort of largely</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.270" end="00:55:23.960" style="s2">utilitarian kind of understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.720" end="00:55:26.630" style="s2">right that it&#39;s about selection and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.960" end="00:55:29.130" style="s2">putting in an organized fashion right it</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.630" end="00:55:30.690" style="s2">centers around that kind of thing you</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.130" end="00:55:33.870" style="s2">know what is appropriate and how best to</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.690" end="00:55:36.870" style="s2">how best to organize it whereas for me</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.870" end="00:55:38.760" style="s2">it&#39;s more about you know tending your</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.870" end="00:55:41.460" style="s2">garden would be a form of curation that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.760" end="00:55:43.740" style="s2">kind of thing you know it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.460" end="00:55:47.490" style="s2">about maintenance and care there&#39;s love</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.740" end="00:55:48.600" style="s2">involved in curation this kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.490" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">for me anyway I mean I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.600" end="00:55:52.650" style="s2">this is what I bring to it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.220" end="00:55:55.650" style="s2">saying this is your formal definition of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.650" end="00:55:57.240" style="s2">the word right and so to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.650" end="00:55:58.830" style="s2">question here what&#39;s the in-between</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.240" end="00:56:03.480" style="s2">curation and sense making for me</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.830" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">curation would be kind of but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.480" end="00:56:07.710" style="s2">as linear as this kind of what happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:10.530" style="s2">after sense making and decision making</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.710" end="00:56:12.570" style="s2">have been done the thing that has come</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.530" end="00:56:14.780" style="s2">out of that process now needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.570" end="00:56:16.980" style="s2">tended and looked after but also</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.780" end="00:56:18.360" style="s2">questioned and examined ready for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.980" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">next round of sense making a decision</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.360" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">making right it&#39;s part of a cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:26.280" style="s2">curation is it is part of a cycle so it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:32.030" style="s2">comes both before and after since making</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.280" end="00:56:32.030" style="s2">if you like as it&#39;s part of a cycle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.230" end="00:56:37.770" style="s2">the word that the reason I asked that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.420" end="00:56:42.330" style="s2">question is the thing that kept coming</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.770" end="00:56:47.430" style="s2">to mind is the concept of outsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.330" end="00:56:49.350" style="s2">sense making and you know in in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.430" end="00:56:51.150" style="s2">cases there&#39;s too much information and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.350" end="00:56:52.920" style="s2">so we choose to outsource certain</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.150" end="00:57:00.420" style="s2">aspects of our sense making to someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.920" end="00:57:03.840" style="s2">else to someone else&#39;s curated narrative</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.420" end="00:57:08.250" style="s2">of reality I think that that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.840" end="00:57:09.750" style="s2">way I yeah appreciate that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.250" end="00:57:12.300" style="s2">answering that case and print did you</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.750" end="00:57:17.790" style="s2">have an aunt did you have an answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.300" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">I would just add like it makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.790" end="00:57:22.320" style="s2">of the intellectual darkweb again to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">to go back to that kind of canard</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.320" end="00:57:29.910" style="s2">because that was a lot of curation of</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.010" end="00:57:33.480" style="s2">like under certain topics or memes like</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.910" end="00:57:37.290" style="s2">free speech right like rationality like</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.480" end="00:57:40.230" style="s2">these were the positive normative kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.290" end="00:57:42.690" style="s2">of guidelines of that curation right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.230" end="00:57:45.450" style="s2">that&#39;s why like I mentioned big thing at</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.690" end="00:57:47.010" style="s2">the beginning and big think used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.450" end="00:57:48.900" style="s2">platform that that really admired like</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.010" end="00:57:53.220" style="s2">you know have all these public</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.900" end="00:57:56.610" style="s2">intellectuals and big ideas but as I</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.220" end="00:57:58.860" style="s2">matured as an independent thinker myself</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.610" end="00:58:01.590" style="s2">I started to see big thinkers just to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.860" end="00:58:06.150" style="s2">kind of diluted corporate kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.590" end="00:58:08.340" style="s2">platform like like um you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.150" end="00:58:11.400" style="s2">could see other mainstream media like</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.340" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">NBC kind of piggyback piggybacking the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.400" end="00:58:18.990" style="s2">theme and it was it was just kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:22.110" style="s2">know do it doing a disservice to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.990" end="00:58:23.820" style="s2">critical edge of of Reason which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.110" end="00:58:25.350" style="s2">ultimately why we all do this but but</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.820" end="00:58:27.870" style="s2">just to go back to your point about us</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.350" end="00:58:29.850" style="s2">deferring sense-making to other groups</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.870" end="00:58:31.740" style="s2">because of complexity like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.850" end="00:58:33.930" style="s2">intellectual dark web is a kind of good</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.740" end="00:58:37.650" style="s2">and bad example of this because it had</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.930" end="00:58:40.830" style="s2">all of these ostensibly like credential</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.650" end="00:58:43.230" style="s2">public intellectuals you know rate</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.830" end="00:58:45.540" style="s2">ranging I like to bring in the more</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.230" end="00:58:47.670" style="s2">innocuous ones like Steven Pinker right</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.540" end="00:58:54.600" style="s2">like Steven Pinker is very friendly very</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.670" end="00:58:56.430" style="s2">popular but ultimately the take away of</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.600" end="00:58:58.920" style="s2">his message is like everything&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.430" end="00:59:01.640" style="s2">and you know the capitalism is fine</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.920" end="00:59:08.910" style="s2">everything&#39;s fine everybody chill out</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.640" end="00:59:11.460" style="s2">and so they decide yeah I like him as an</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.910" end="00:59:14.490" style="s2">example though because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.460" end="00:59:16.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a you get vilified if you critique</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.490" end="00:59:18.990" style="s2">people like him right and it just</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.440" end="00:59:20.010" style="s2">becomes very divisive because he you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.990" end="00:59:22.200" style="s2">know you look at him and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.010" end="00:59:23.640" style="s2">Jonathan hi and they&#39;re like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.200" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">friendly person why would anybody</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.640" end="00:59:28.710" style="s2">dislike me you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:32.940" style="s2">there&#39;s just a dark side to the curation</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.710" end="00:59:35.490" style="s2">of this whole a kind of zeitgeist of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.940" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">reason and and of and again it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.490" end="00:59:40.470" style="s2">left out right all that like not only is</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:45.150" style="s2">social justice left out but their whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.470" end="00:59:47.220" style="s2">kind of MO is to critique social justice</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.150" end="00:59:50.010" style="s2">is to critique post-modernism and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.220" end="00:59:52.860" style="s2">not engage with those people right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.010" end="00:59:55.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a great example of curation</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.860" end="00:59:57.390" style="s2">gone wrong I think in a sense because</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.530" end="00:59:58.770" style="s2">the if they&#39;ve tried to just package all</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.390" end="01:00:01.860" style="s2">the best parts of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.770" end="01:00:06.180" style="s2">project and then completely left out</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.860" end="01:00:08.520" style="s2">everything else let&#39;s say Merrick pops</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.180" end="01:00:09.900" style="s2">back on others just internet but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.520" end="01:00:13.890" style="s2">just gonna wrap up because we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.900" end="01:00:18.030" style="s2">one hour mark Kira do you have any final</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.890" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">one this might actually tie in to kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.030" end="01:00:23.250" style="s2">of a future sub subject</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:25.800" style="s2">brenton what you were talking about of</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.250" end="01:00:29.010" style="s2">the kind of the dark side of you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.800" end="01:00:32.880" style="s2">bringing in a shadow and how that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.010" end="01:00:35.900" style="s2">collective shadow and how that plays out</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:39.090" style="s2">in curation that just be an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.900" end="01:00:42.600" style="s2">acid how shadow plays out in curation</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.090" end="01:00:44.700" style="s2">but in other aspects of the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.600" end="01:00:47.610" style="s2">game B I think that would be an</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.700" end="01:00:52.730" style="s2">interesting thing to talk about and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.610" end="01:00:55.860" style="s2">seems like a sort of part of this topic</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.730" end="01:00:59.210" style="s2">especially when they talk about shadow -</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.860" end="01:01:03.030" style="s2">if the group we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.210" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">curating some of this kind of shadow</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.030" end="01:01:09.120" style="s2">talk and and like partly self criticism</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.980" style="s2">and partly projecting onto others I</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.120" end="01:01:15.990" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good meta question of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.980" end="01:01:17.820" style="s2">of that curation Eric do you have any</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.990" end="01:01:20.900" style="s2">final thoughts I were just wrapping it</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.820" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">up I&#39;m you were echoing slimy to do oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.900" end="01:01:25.380" style="s2">yeah no I couldn&#39;t I lost you for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:26.760" style="s2">couple of minutes there my internet</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.380" end="01:01:27.870" style="s2">connection by now I lost secret company</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.760" end="01:01:30.060" style="s2">so I didn&#39;t hear anything anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.870" end="01:01:32.180" style="s2">said no I don&#39;t have anything new to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.060" end="01:01:34.800" style="s2">no not that I think of thank you</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.180" end="01:01:37.640" style="s2">all right it&#39;s a goodbye to YouTube and</p>
