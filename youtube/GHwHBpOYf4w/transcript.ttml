<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:45.380" style="s2">obviously infection and microbiome is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.909" end="00:01:46.550" style="s2">just one part of it but it&#39;s a part that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.380" end="00:01:48.920" style="s2">she&#39;s done a lot of work with so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.550" end="00:01:50.600" style="s2">wanted to dive into that so nafisa</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.920" end="00:01:53.030" style="s2">welcome thank you for being here today</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.090" end="00:02:01.340" style="s2">you and Anna Pisa and I have had the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.850" end="00:02:03.500" style="s2">opportunity to actually work on a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.340" end="00:02:05.570" style="s2">people&#39;s cases together and to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.500" end="00:02:07.220" style="s2">kind of compare notes on addressing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.570" end="00:02:11.269" style="s2">things like infection so knew this would</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.220" end="00:02:16.819" style="s2">be fun so for a lot of people the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.269" end="00:02:18.049" style="s2">of chronic subclinical infection is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.819" end="00:02:20.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even make sense right the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.049" end="00:02:22.610" style="s2">there is a classic idea of acute</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.420" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">infection you have C difficile and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.610" end="00:02:25.730" style="s2">have to get on antibiotics or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:28.850" style="s2">going to die or you have you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:32.990" style="s2">acute flu or Mercer or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.850" end="00:02:34.880" style="s2">but asymptomatic or where the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.990" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">are you know delayed in time or</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.880" end="00:02:39.230" style="s2">non-obvious infection is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.940" style="s2">the integrative functional naturopathic</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.230" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">medicine community is focused on for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.940" end="00:02:45.950" style="s2">long time many traditional systems of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">medicine have is not one of the common</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.950" end="00:02:52.040" style="s2">parts of Western medical focus except in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">cases where now you know there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.040" end="00:02:56.540" style="s2">awareness of things like the role of h</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:02:58.340" style="s2">pylori and stomach cancer or you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.540" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">viruses and certain kinds of cancer so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.340" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">that&#39;s you know increasing an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:07.150" style="s2">but can we just start by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">chronic infection that is not acute</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.150" end="00:03:15.010" style="s2">what&#39;s that about yeah so there can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:18.980" style="s2">infections in certain areas of the body</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.010" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">dental and sinuses but people have no</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.980" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">idea about it essentially these</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:26.630" style="s2">illnesses are contained in the immune</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:31.790" style="s2">system they&#39;re completely without</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.630" end="00:03:34.190" style="s2">symptoms um it can be viruses bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.790" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">even lying and co-infections people</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.190" end="00:03:40.310" style="s2">people can be walking around this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:44.030" style="s2">infection no idea about it until there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.310" end="00:03:46.310" style="s2">a stressor and that stress depletes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.030" end="00:03:47.990" style="s2">immune system all of a sudden know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:49.960" style="s2">they&#39;re walking around with symptoms so</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.990" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">I see a lot of patients like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.960" end="00:03:54.740" style="s2">stresses stressors can be physical often</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:57.320" style="s2">motor vehicle accidents they can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.740" end="00:03:59.330" style="s2">emotional or mental stresses I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.320" end="00:04:03.050" style="s2">that brings me immune system down and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.330" end="00:04:06.260" style="s2">that allows for the microbes to fester</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.050" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">suddenly the person showing symptoms so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.260" end="00:04:11.060" style="s2">one of the key ideas here is that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:13.820" style="s2">someone starts showing symptoms it might</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.060" end="00:04:15.080" style="s2">not be that the infection happened right</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.820" end="00:04:17.000" style="s2">before then it might have been that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.080" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">there was infectious exposure that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.000" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">stayed below a particular level long</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:23.270" style="s2">term and then known this is oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:26.420" style="s2">the case was like someone who has a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.270" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">term chronic herpes infection a physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.420" end="00:04:30.050" style="s2">or emotional stressor can actually bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:31.370" style="s2">about an outbreak that can happen with</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:34.420" style="s2">lots of other kinds of infection</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.370" end="00:04:36.680" style="s2">absolutely and the symptoms might not be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.420" end="00:04:39.950" style="s2">obviously connected to the type of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.680" end="00:04:41.790" style="s2">infection know they might know these</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.950" end="00:04:44.100" style="s2">infections can spread to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.790" end="00:04:48.060" style="s2">systems of the body so someone could</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.100" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">have infection in their jaw but they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.060" end="00:04:55.350" style="s2">they&#39;ll feel headaches or sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">those infections the bugs or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.350" end="00:05:01.590" style="s2">biotoxins or inflammation can drop down</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">towards the gut or the respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.590" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">system then they&#39;re having symptoms in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:09.390" style="s2">those different areas so it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:13.170" style="s2">hunting around to find out where the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.390" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">infections are and what they are so for</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.170" end="00:05:17.070" style="s2">those who are already deeply familiar</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">with these topics be patient as we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.070" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">to lay down the foundations we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.510" end="00:05:22.230" style="s2">into deeper things but we want to kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:24.690" style="s2">of start at the beginning so those who</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.230" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">aren&#39;t familiar get a lay of the land so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.690" end="00:05:28.950" style="s2">you mentioned biotoxins so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:33.020" style="s2">difference between an infection and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.950" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">biotoxin the relationship so microbes</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.020" end="00:05:38.210" style="s2">parasites</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:42.180" style="s2">you know parasites smaller microbes they</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.210" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">they send out toxins as a way to protect</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.180" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">themselves from our our body&#39;s immune</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">system and and they&#39;re smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:53.720" style="s2">so those toxins can actually win over</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:56.010" style="s2">our immune system especially if we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.720" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">compromised in other ways so if we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.010" end="00:06:00.990" style="s2">multiple infections if we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.960" end="00:06:04.320" style="s2">environmental toxicity those bio toxins</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">which microbes and parasites send out</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.320" end="00:06:10.500" style="s2">they can run their immune system down</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.300" end="00:06:13.470" style="s2">even further yeah so mold is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.500" end="00:06:16.230" style="s2">classic example right serious you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.470" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">when people are dealing with mold in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.230" end="00:06:19.380" style="s2">their environment they might not</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:20.760" style="s2">actually have any living mold in their</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.380" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">body they&#39;re just dealing with the micro</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.760" end="00:06:26.210" style="s2">toxic byproducts that the mold produces</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">definitely and we can measure those</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.210" end="00:06:31.290" style="s2">micro toxins so you started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:32.910" style="s2">categorize types of infections you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.290" end="00:06:35.610" style="s2">parasites and micro infections you want</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.910" end="00:06:37.980" style="s2">to give a kind of lay of the land of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.610" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">categories of infection we look at in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.980" end="00:06:44.910" style="s2">some clinical cases yes so there can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:49.590" style="s2">viruses epstein-barr virus died alone</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.910" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">cytomegalovirus coxsackievirus so these</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.590" end="00:06:54.330" style="s2">are viruses that can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:55.439" style="s2">insidious we can exist person doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.330" end="00:06:59.909" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.439" end="00:07:02.969" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s bacteria books there</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.909" end="00:07:06.199" style="s2">can be gut bacteria that can be bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.969" end="00:07:08.519" style="s2">in the respiratory system and and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.199" end="00:07:11.639" style="s2">parasites parasites are a big one</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.519" end="00:07:14.339" style="s2">they&#39;re difficult to test for so those</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.639" end="00:07:16.289" style="s2">have to be more a clinical diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.339" end="00:07:18.449" style="s2">based on what the patient is telling me</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.289" end="00:07:20.969" style="s2">based on their symptoms international</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.449" end="00:07:23.610" style="s2">travel the other bugs they&#39;re easier to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.969" end="00:07:25.319" style="s2">test for now</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.610" end="00:07:28.019" style="s2">parasites mean two things means</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.319" end="00:07:30.839" style="s2">macroscopic parasites which means actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.019" end="00:07:33.209" style="s2">bugs right multicellular things worms</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.839" end="00:07:38.599" style="s2">and flukes and then microscopic protozoa</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.209" end="00:07:41.489" style="s2">photos are usually easy to test for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.599" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">but I think of them as Suckerfish so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.489" end="00:07:46.860" style="s2">you have those small protozoa our last</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:50.099" style="s2">two sisters enterobacter I found find</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.860" end="00:07:53.610" style="s2">those often and test I think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.099" end="00:07:55.889" style="s2">soccer fish on sharks sharks are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.610" end="00:07:58.889" style="s2">bigger the bigger parasites the ones you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.889" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">mentioned look like those those can</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.889" end="00:08:03.179" style="s2">exist I have patients sending me</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:08.189" style="s2">pictures of what they find so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.179" end="00:08:10.949" style="s2">fun topic because outside of like pin</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.189" end="00:08:12.779" style="s2">worms and kids in the developed world</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.949" end="00:08:14.159" style="s2">most people don&#39;t think about worms in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.779" end="00:08:15.839" style="s2">humans so they think about them in dogs</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.159" end="00:08:18.929" style="s2">and cats and livestock right and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.839" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">they will deworm their dogs every year</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.929" end="00:08:22.019" style="s2">they worm their cats if fleas are around</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:23.490" style="s2">they know they have to deworm more and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.019" end="00:08:25.409" style="s2">they even know that we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.490" end="00:08:26.819" style="s2">talking about GI worms we have heartworm</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.409" end="00:08:28.289" style="s2">it&#39;s a common thing in dogs right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.819" end="00:08:29.639" style="s2">we&#39;re like a worms can get into dog</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.289" end="00:08:31.139" style="s2">hearts but they don&#39;t get into human</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.639" end="00:08:33.959" style="s2">hearts right you know we&#39;re in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.139" end="00:08:37.110" style="s2">organs so I think most people think</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.959" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">about worms in terms of tropical</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.110" end="00:08:42.149" style="s2">infections in poor areas like guinea</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:45.029" style="s2">worm but this is not a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.149" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">of thinking about it and yeah where you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.029" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">started dr. Klink heart actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:53.790" style="s2">does a lot of emphasis in macro scopic</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.420" end="00:08:56.759" style="s2">parasite infections so talk to us more</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.790" end="00:08:59.579" style="s2">about this these come these are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.759" end="00:09:02.069" style="s2">common people more commonly people think</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.579" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">so I&#39;m talking about complex chronic</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.069" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">illness right now um although I believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:10.769" style="s2">that can also be well but</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:13.559" style="s2">learning systems able to tolerate it dr.</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.769" end="00:09:15.509" style="s2">clean heart uses the term uneasy</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.559" end="00:09:17.220" style="s2">alliance he says we&#39;ve got an uneasy</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.509" end="00:09:21.869" style="s2">alliance with these parasites meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.220" end="00:09:24.509" style="s2">that our bodies are more likely have</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.869" end="00:09:26.220" style="s2">such parasites if heavy metals and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.509" end="00:09:28.980" style="s2">toxins make our body more of a breeding</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.220" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">ground for such parasites and so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.980" end="00:09:35.939" style="s2">Alliance the uneasy alliances that these</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:38.369" style="s2">parasites they they hold on to our toxic</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.939" end="00:09:40.319" style="s2">burden for us but we have a better way</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.369" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">to deal with our toxic burden than to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.319" end="00:09:44.730" style="s2">have parasites that are sucking the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.029" end="00:09:48.749" style="s2">nutrients out of us or giving us GI</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.730" end="00:09:51.119" style="s2">distress making last week so to just</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.749" end="00:09:53.009" style="s2">kind of go into this a little bit we</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.119" end="00:09:55.379" style="s2">obviously have a symbiotic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.009" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">with the bacteria in our microbiome and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.379" end="00:09:59.309" style="s2">with the healthy yeast in the microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:01.639" style="s2">what we&#39;re saying here is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.309" end="00:10:03.809" style="s2">have a symbiotic relationship in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.639" end="00:10:06.209" style="s2">compromised condition but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.809" end="00:10:08.279" style="s2">compromised symbiosis and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.209" end="00:10:09.359" style="s2">species that wouldn&#39;t normally exist or</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.279" end="00:10:10.889" style="s2">there would exist in much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.359" end="00:10:12.360" style="s2">amounts in the case of parasites would</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.889" end="00:10:15.929" style="s2">normally exist at all that actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.360" end="00:10:19.619" style="s2">serve a symbian role yes but at a cost</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.929" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">exactly can you say a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.619" end="00:10:23.309" style="s2">the accumulation of toxins because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.660" end="00:10:26.369" style="s2">don&#39;t think that is also a commonly</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.309" end="00:10:28.499" style="s2">known topic you know one thing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.369" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">noticed in medicine over the past</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.499" end="00:10:33.029" style="s2">appears that illnesses are different</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">well suddenly we&#39;re seeing people with</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.029" end="00:10:37.529" style="s2">more autoimmune conditions multiple</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.439" style="s2">chemical sensitivity higher</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.529" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">susceptibility to infections so these</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.439" end="00:10:44.459" style="s2">bugs have always been here Lyme is baby</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">air mold has been here the viruses were</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.459" end="00:10:49.019" style="s2">here 15 years ago right why are we more</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:50.119" style="s2">susceptible to them in a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.019" end="00:10:52.410" style="s2">weren&#39;t before</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.119" end="00:10:55.470" style="s2">why are suddenly people more susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.410" end="00:10:57.269" style="s2">to chemicals these autoimmune conditions</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.470" end="00:10:58.829" style="s2">why are we certainly creating suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.269" end="00:11:01.639" style="s2">creating antibodies suddenly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.829" end="00:11:04.739" style="s2">certainly creating antibodies to our own</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.639" end="00:11:08.429" style="s2">self and I think it has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.739" end="00:11:11.369" style="s2">the onslaught of toxicity in our world</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.429" end="00:11:14.189" style="s2">so in the air we breathe in the food we</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.369" end="00:11:17.579" style="s2">eat and dr. Kling heart really talks</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.189" end="00:11:19.769" style="s2">about this as well and so I do a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.579" end="00:11:20.690" style="s2">detoxification work but I measure it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.769" end="00:11:23.240" style="s2">through labs on</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.690" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">heavy metals I&#39;ll measure s asides and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.240" end="00:11:28.430" style="s2">solvents and chemicals and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:30.650" style="s2">definitely see these elevated without a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.430" end="00:11:33.230" style="s2">doubt in my patients with neurological</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.650" end="00:11:37.310" style="s2">illnesses and no chronic infectious</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.230" end="00:11:41.110" style="s2">diseases as well okay so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.310" end="00:11:43.310" style="s2">actually get clear on the topic of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.110" end="00:11:44.960" style="s2">subclinical condition whether about</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.310" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">subclinical infection or sub clinical</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.960" end="00:11:50.060" style="s2">toxicology because again when we think</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:51.890" style="s2">about heavy metal infections from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.060" end="00:11:53.780" style="s2">traditional allopathic point of view</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.890" end="00:11:57.350" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about acute industrial</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.780" end="00:11:59.450" style="s2">exposure and there&#39;s a you know level of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.350" end="00:12:01.190" style="s2">mercury exposure where we say oh there</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.450" end="00:12:03.530" style="s2">was a cute mercury toxicity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.190" end="00:12:05.780" style="s2">going to do some active kind of detox</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.530" end="00:12:09.380" style="s2">chelation and we think about that as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.780" end="00:12:11.840" style="s2">you know toxicology caused illness acute</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.380" end="00:12:13.640" style="s2">very high level then we think about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.840" end="00:12:15.380" style="s2">ideal levels are and the key is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.640" end="00:12:19.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty big range in between</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.380" end="00:12:20.900" style="s2">ideal and actual toxic exposure which</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.160" end="00:12:23.030" style="s2">we&#39;d call a subclinical level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.900" end="00:12:25.130" style="s2">toxicity it&#39;s not going to instantly</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.030" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">poison you might be asymptomatic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.130" end="00:12:29.390" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna weaken the system you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:33.170" style="s2">talk a little bit more about from that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.390" end="00:12:37.370" style="s2">perspective how often you see toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.170" end="00:12:38.900" style="s2">deficiency and infectious things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.370" end="00:12:40.690" style="s2">people wouldn&#39;t normally think of if</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.900" end="00:12:44.060" style="s2">they were just thinking about normal</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.690" end="00:12:47.090" style="s2">toxic levels yeah so my patients were</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.060" end="00:12:48.710" style="s2">sick they&#39;ve they&#39;ve seen about 20</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.090" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">different doctors before they come to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.710" end="00:12:55.400" style="s2">or before they come to Gordon medical</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:58.040" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been told you&#39;re fine your</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.400" end="00:13:00.400" style="s2">labs look normal go home or this is all</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.040" end="00:13:03.740" style="s2">in your head here&#39;s an antidepressant</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.400" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">top you with this hey my patients were</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.740" end="00:13:10.100" style="s2">well poor or looking for a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:12.260" style="s2">more optimization they&#39;re told oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.100" end="00:13:14.540" style="s2">just age you just you&#39;re just now in</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.260" end="00:13:19.130" style="s2">your 40s these things happen to you go</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.540" end="00:13:23.300" style="s2">home your blood work but when you dig</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.130" end="00:13:26.180" style="s2">deeper then you&#39;re able to find that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.300" end="00:13:30.620" style="s2">toxic load pretty high in my stick</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.180" end="00:13:32.810" style="s2">population for sure borderline high in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.620" end="00:13:37.160" style="s2">people who are well to a level where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.810" end="00:13:39.050" style="s2">want to decrease it for prevention so if</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.160" end="00:13:43.580" style="s2">we take heavy metals for instance and as</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.050" end="00:13:44.960" style="s2">one example of toxic load that according</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:05.060" style="s2">vaccines right and medicine chelation is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.050" end="00:14:05.870" style="s2">a very controversial topic how to even</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.060" end="00:14:07.640" style="s2">assess it</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.870" end="00:14:11.570" style="s2">the problem with hair labs and urine</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.570" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">tricky I&#39;d be you can&#39;t be very happy if</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:22.760" style="s2">listeners are interested to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:25.550" style="s2">into the the body of clinical data here</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.760" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">and research on it but just from your</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.550" end="00:14:30.950" style="s2">actual patient experience and clinical</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:35.170" style="s2">experience not from not from literature</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.950" end="00:14:38.209" style="s2">so when you when you do a provoked metal</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.170" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">challenge and you see elevated lead or</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.209" end="00:14:42.890" style="s2">cadmium or mercury or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:44.450" style="s2">you do some detox protocol using</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.890" end="00:14:48.170" style="s2">chelation or binders or whatever you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.450" end="00:14:50.209" style="s2">what do you see happen for people I see</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.170" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">quite a few things happened for sick</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.209" end="00:14:56.900" style="s2">people I&#39;ve seen nerve issues</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:15:00.440" style="s2">go away nerve issues meaning things like</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.900" end="00:15:04.100" style="s2">restless leg syndrome compulsions</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.440" end="00:15:07.910" style="s2">we must disappear and sick people okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.100" end="00:15:10.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen cognition become more clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.910" end="00:15:14.630" style="s2">for people they&#39;re less confused I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.940" end="00:15:18.020" style="s2">seen I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.630" end="00:15:20.420" style="s2">memory memory become better and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.020" end="00:15:22.640" style="s2">immune system improved so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.420" end="00:15:24.410" style="s2">they&#39;re actually less susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.640" end="00:15:27.260" style="s2">other infections once I start to clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.410" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">the metals out and with regard to immune</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.260" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">system you mean not just that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">getting sick less often but you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:33.890" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.550" end="00:15:38.750" style="s2">see biomarkers change immune biomarkers</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.890" end="00:15:41.380" style="s2">absolutely yeah so now they say if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.750" end="00:15:45.830" style="s2">have an uneasy alliance with parasites</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.380" end="00:15:47.959" style="s2">would say you don&#39;t want to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.830" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">the worms if you have them right away</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.959" end="00:15:51.230" style="s2">without addressing metals if the worms</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:52.459" style="s2">are actually accumulating metals and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.230" end="00:15:57.019" style="s2">protecting the body from it I would also</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.459" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">say that just getting rid of the metals</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.019" end="00:16:01.610" style="s2">on its own might not work as well as if</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.370" style="s2">you kind of work with the two together</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.610" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">so is that your approach absolutely so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:11.750" style="s2">layer the approach so before I start to</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:14.779" style="s2">kill off parasites it might be with</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.750" end="00:16:18.950" style="s2">metals or other chemicals that I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.779" end="00:16:21.200" style="s2">through laboratory tests mycotoxins as</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.950" end="00:16:23.930" style="s2">well so I&#39;ll detoxify first to make the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.200" end="00:16:27.160" style="s2">body if you will less of a breeding</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.930" end="00:16:29.899" style="s2">ground for the parents or microbes i</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.160" end="00:16:32.089" style="s2">detoxify and then i I come in and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.899" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">start to bring the microbial count or</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.089" end="00:16:37.130" style="s2">the parasite count down using either</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.990" style="s2">herbs or pharmaceuticals and then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.130" end="00:16:41.510" style="s2">rotate because I know that when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.990" end="00:16:44.120" style="s2">killing microbes and parasites they dump</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.510" end="00:16:46.940" style="s2">the metals and they also don&#39;t biotoxin</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.120" end="00:16:49.459" style="s2">so I need to sweep out sweep that up</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.940" end="00:16:57.110" style="s2">from the body if you will and discharge</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.459" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">it so because coming back to worms worms</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.110" end="00:17:03.770" style="s2">flukes microscopic bugs even though they</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:05.809" style="s2">might not be as acutely lethal to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.770" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">someone as a particular bacteria or</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.809" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">virus might be it just freaks people out</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">to think about bugs inside of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:16.780" style="s2">basically eating their tissue and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an interesting topic</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.780" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">now the reason they&#39;re hard to diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">is if you do a stool test you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">obviously only gonna see things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:28.760" style="s2">show up in the GI tract not things would</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:30.260" style="s2">be in other areas but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.760" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">necessarily shedding in the store right</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.260" end="00:17:33.620" style="s2">unlike microbiome which is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">everywhere we might be looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.620" end="00:17:37.580" style="s2">small number of these and particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">locations so you need many many stool</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.580" end="00:17:41.710" style="s2">labs to have a high sense of accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:43.700" style="s2">and not have false negatives and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.710" end="00:17:44.920" style="s2">obviously if we&#39;re talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.700" end="00:17:46.390" style="s2">in other parts of the ball</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.920" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna see it in the stool you</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.390" end="00:17:50.440" style="s2">have to depend on antibodies which are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:52.570" style="s2">fairly unreliable so diagnosis is tricky</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.440" end="00:17:56.230" style="s2">so if you&#39;re largely working on clinical</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.570" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">presentation I am yeah so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.230" end="00:18:02.140" style="s2">look for where you think maybe it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:06.940" style="s2">to treat parasites so um here are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.140" end="00:18:08.590" style="s2">basic symptoms so a person person is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.940" end="00:18:11.170" style="s2">hungry all the time they&#39;re ravenous</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.590" end="00:18:13.750" style="s2">they&#39;re not able to nourish themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.170" end="00:18:16.900" style="s2">they eat and they eat and I look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.750" end="00:18:19.650" style="s2">their their micro nutrient labs low and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.900" end="00:18:22.330" style="s2">amino acids low in minerals vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.650" end="00:18:25.390" style="s2">antioxidants but they&#39;re eating they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.330" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">eating a beautiful diet okay and above</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.390" end="00:18:30.850" style="s2">other symptoms like gas and bloating</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.510" style="s2">usually constipation could also show is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.850" end="00:18:35.020" style="s2">diarrhea</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.510" end="00:18:37.660" style="s2">um aging of the anus as well is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.020" end="00:18:39.870" style="s2">common so these would all indicate GI</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.660" end="00:18:42.850" style="s2">parasites that would be actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.870" end="00:18:44.220" style="s2">nutrients damaging the mucosal lining</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.850" end="00:18:48.130" style="s2">making it hard to absorb nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.220" end="00:18:50.650" style="s2">making GI issues how so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.130" end="00:18:53.770" style="s2">looking at something like lungworm or</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.650" end="00:18:55.870" style="s2">liver flukes or things that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.770" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">outside of the GI system what would you</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:19:03.040" style="s2">look at you know that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.790" end="00:19:05.290" style="s2">symptomatic based on inflammation really</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.040" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">are they are they sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.290" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">everything now I&#39;m guessing I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:15.930" style="s2">can&#39;t diagnose those that&#39;s your wild</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:18.610" style="s2">guess and in treating for those directly</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.930" end="00:19:21.790" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to do but if I treat the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.610" end="00:19:25.530" style="s2">system their whole body systemically I</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.790" end="00:19:28.660" style="s2">believe but when their body when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.530" end="00:19:32.020" style="s2">when I can increase their immunity make</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.660" end="00:19:35.830" style="s2">their body stronger those other very</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.020" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">much harder to diagnose parasite</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.830" end="00:19:43.300" style="s2">infections can come down and the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:46.490" style="s2">clean heart style parasite protocol has</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.300" end="00:19:47.790" style="s2">a lot of systemic antiparasitics</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.490" end="00:19:50.110" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.790" end="00:19:54.370" style="s2">so when you when you run that protocol</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.110" end="00:19:57.220" style="s2">on people again what do you find happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.370" end="00:19:58.510" style="s2">as people go through the anti-parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.220" end="00:20:02.200" style="s2">work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.510" end="00:20:03.790" style="s2">they can get wiped out tired them all I</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.200" end="00:20:07.330" style="s2">might have to slow them down on it I</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.790" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">might have to increase the consultation</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.330" end="00:20:15.730" style="s2">methods as well so it&#39;s a dance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">different in the middle of it others</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.730" end="00:20:20.200" style="s2">they feel nothing they&#39;re like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:22.600" style="s2">even tell him taking medicine but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.200" end="00:20:24.940" style="s2">increased energy some people are just</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.600" end="00:20:26.470" style="s2">really really tired um and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.940" end="00:20:28.870" style="s2">has to do with the body&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.470" end="00:20:31.780" style="s2">detoxify so it&#39;s gonna be a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.870" end="00:20:34.420" style="s2">response for each person and so then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.780" end="00:20:38.590" style="s2">have to modulate based on on how that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.420" end="00:20:40.090" style="s2">person reacts so beyond what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:41.650" style="s2">as they&#39;re in the protocol and their</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.090" end="00:20:43.990" style="s2">body is obviously processing the meds</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.650" end="00:20:48.070" style="s2">and processing died off if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.990" end="00:20:51.130" style="s2">happening what do you actually find as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.070" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">result of the protocol overall at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.130" end="00:20:56.590" style="s2">end of the day they&#39;ve got much more</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:21:00.730" style="s2">increased health their their line</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.590" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">symptoms tend to go away I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.730" end="00:21:04.600" style="s2">directly treating the line what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:06.940" style="s2">doing is I&#39;m treating the parasites and</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.880" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">people have some chronic illness they</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.560" end="00:21:39.730" style="s2">doing with autoimmunity or nerdy Janek</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:42.010" style="s2">rank fatigue how often do you see</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.730" end="00:21:43.960" style="s2">parasites indicated and I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.010" end="00:21:45.670" style="s2">about people in your practice which</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.960" end="00:21:48.670" style="s2">means they live in the Bay Area they</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.670" end="00:21:52.120" style="s2">don&#39;t live in Saharan sub-saharan Africa</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.670" end="00:21:55.180" style="s2">no it&#39;s very common very very common and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.120" end="00:21:56.380" style="s2">so remember how I said when I do a stool</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.180" end="00:21:58.120" style="s2">test like we can see the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.380" end="00:22:00.820" style="s2">pathogens right there they&#39;re easy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.120" end="00:22:03.690" style="s2">see the amoebas the enterobacter blast</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.820" end="00:22:05.860" style="s2">the sisters I see those every day on</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.690" end="00:22:08.380" style="s2">regular people living in the in the Bay</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.860" end="00:22:11.630" style="s2">Area optimizers on the healthy people I</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.380" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">see it on the sick people as well they</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.630" end="00:22:18.380" style="s2">that&#39;s an indicator to me that there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:23.390" style="s2">more parasites though I see it every day</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.380" end="00:22:26.780" style="s2">in my practice on those stool tests so</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.390" end="00:22:29.720" style="s2">the interesting thing here is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.780" end="00:22:33.410" style="s2">people who are asymptomatic and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.720" end="00:22:36.140" style="s2">as you mentioned earlier might be some</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.410" end="00:22:38.090" style="s2">stressful incidents away from having an</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.140" end="00:22:41.179" style="s2">infection that is actually being kept at</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.090" end="00:22:43.880" style="s2">a relatively low level be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.179" end="00:22:45.559" style="s2">into some kind of cascade definitely I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.880" end="00:22:48.530" style="s2">love to speak to that a bit so most of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.559" end="00:22:52.039" style="s2">my patients who are chronically ill they</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.530" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">may have businesses they run there some</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.039" end="00:22:55.789" style="s2">of them are Olympians some of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:59.570" style="s2">celebrities there are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.789" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">highly functional in the world and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.570" end="00:23:04.460" style="s2">they had been for a long long time and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:11.690" style="s2">the key was all of a sudden something</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.460" end="00:23:13.880" style="s2">happened and that is that is that is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.690" end="00:23:17.890" style="s2">case of a subclinical infection suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.880" end="00:23:21.140" style="s2">becoming big in somebody somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.890" end="00:23:23.750" style="s2">driven and having an having a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.140" end="00:23:25.190" style="s2">engaged life suddenly they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.750" end="00:23:29.720" style="s2">something they&#39;re having to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.190" end="00:23:31.929" style="s2">conversations about about we&#39;re needing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.720" end="00:23:33.890" style="s2">their house from mold you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.929" end="00:23:35.630" style="s2">conversations that might make them look</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.890" end="00:23:39.799" style="s2">a little bit weird in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.630" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">all of a sudden yeah so this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.799" end="00:23:43.909" style="s2">interesting right because somebody can</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">get in a car accident and have a sore</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.909" end="00:23:48.890" style="s2">neck and do some massages or</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:50.330" style="s2">chiropractic surest and then be fine or</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.890" end="00:23:51.770" style="s2">they can get in the car accident and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.330" end="00:23:55.669" style="s2">then start having weird unexplained</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.770" end="00:23:57.650" style="s2">symptoms and then have chronic fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.669" end="00:24:00.980" style="s2">syndrome in a few months that lasts the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.650" end="00:24:03.730" style="s2">is debilitating or someone can have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.980" end="00:24:06.070" style="s2">divorce and be emotionally bummed versus</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:11.030" style="s2">emotionally bummed and then they get</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.070" end="00:24:13.700" style="s2">chronic illness and so this is why</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.030" end="00:24:15.559" style="s2">preventive medicine in healthy people is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.700" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">so important is being able to increase</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.559" end="00:24:19.490" style="s2">resilience to things that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:20.990" style="s2">happen we&#39;re gonna have life events but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.490" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to result in the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.990" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">level of negative response actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.720" end="00:24:31.860" style="s2">so this is this is do you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.149" end="00:24:35.230" style="s2">patients who come just for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.860" end="00:24:38.169" style="s2">preventative medicine and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:41.049" style="s2">longevity wellness effects that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.169" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">happening a lot over the past year year</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.049" end="00:24:46.299" style="s2">and a half most definitely especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:48.429" style="s2">here in the Bay Area people people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.299" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">really interested in optimization over</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.429" end="00:24:54.549" style="s2">here come to me just for that and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:24:56.950" style="s2">they&#39;re surprised at the things I might</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.549" end="00:24:58.870" style="s2">find I&#39;m surprised too</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.950" end="00:25:01.980" style="s2">and the things I find subclinical</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.870" end="00:25:04.379" style="s2">infections toxicity n-- the optimizer</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.980" end="00:25:06.580" style="s2">they they want to test everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.379" end="00:25:08.590" style="s2">they&#39;re interested they want to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.580" end="00:25:10.419" style="s2">what do my hormones look like do I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.590" end="00:25:12.250" style="s2">toxicity um</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.419" end="00:25:14.350" style="s2">how about my neurotransmitters in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.250" end="00:25:15.820" style="s2">adrenal function so they want to do all</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.350" end="00:25:19.570" style="s2">the functional medicine tests because</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.820" end="00:25:21.580" style="s2">they want the data on themselves so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.570" end="00:25:26.259" style="s2">we mentioned that we wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.580" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">about the role of chronic infections and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.259" end="00:25:31.149" style="s2">this by OSIS and not just overall health</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:35.409" style="s2">and chronic illness but specifically</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.149" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">mental emotional well-being so we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.409" end="00:25:38.799" style="s2">start with any category then we can dive</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:41.340" style="s2">in deeper but whether we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.799" end="00:25:45.700" style="s2">bacteria or mycoplasma or fungal or</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.340" end="00:25:47.980" style="s2">parasitic what do you notice in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.700" end="00:25:49.960" style="s2">the role that infections play when</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.980" end="00:25:55.059" style="s2">people are dealing with anxiety sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:26:00.970" style="s2">issues depression etc yeah so the key is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.059" end="00:26:04.149" style="s2">that it&#39;s a sudden change in emotion so</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.970" end="00:26:05.769" style="s2">it&#39;s normal or healthy people you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.149" end="00:26:08.230" style="s2">to have some level of anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.769" end="00:26:11.830" style="s2">depression or different variabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.230" end="00:26:14.740" style="s2">OCD okay that&#39;s very normal in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.830" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">healthy population but when suddenly we</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.740" end="00:26:20.440" style="s2">go from having you know sweaty palms</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:24.309" style="s2">before an important meeting to panic</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.440" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">attacks suicidal ideations severe mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.309" end="00:26:29.950" style="s2">confusion right there that&#39;s the key for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:31.480" style="s2">me I know that there&#39;s a sub I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.950" end="00:26:33.340" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say I know I am almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.480" end="00:26:37.929" style="s2">certain there&#39;s a subclinical infection</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.340" end="00:26:39.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s turned that but so can you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.929" end="00:26:41.350" style="s2">describe the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.250" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">right so how do we go from some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.350" end="00:26:46.060" style="s2">infection to suicidal ideation and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:48.010" style="s2">don&#39;t have to focus on suicidal ideation</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.060" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">but when we think of anxiety depression</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.010" end="00:26:52.360" style="s2">ideation we think about neurologic</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">effects and our transmitter effects and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.360" end="00:26:59.170" style="s2">their hormone effects so can you tie the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">the mechanisms together has been called</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.170" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">the second brain for a really good</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.270" end="00:27:07.500" style="s2">reason so we have more neurons in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:11.650" style="s2">gut than we do in our spinal cord and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.500" end="00:27:14.650" style="s2">90% of the communication of I&#39;d say 90%</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.650" end="00:27:17.650" style="s2">of the feedback of communication is from</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.650" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">our gut up to the brain not not</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.650" end="00:27:23.110" style="s2">necessarily as much the reverse so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:25.510" style="s2">gut really wants the brain as to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.110" end="00:27:27.420" style="s2">going on so it&#39;s a second brain in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.510" end="00:27:30.910" style="s2">way it&#39;s not like we can make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.420" end="00:27:33.550" style="s2">with our gut well that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.910" end="00:27:36.100" style="s2">topic on in to me on intuition you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.550" end="00:27:40.030" style="s2">but literally we can&#39;t we can&#39;t debate</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.100" end="00:27:41.500" style="s2">politics or play music with art without</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.030" end="00:27:46.900" style="s2">got the way that we can with our brain</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.500" end="00:27:52.140" style="s2">but our gut having so many nerve not</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.900" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">neurons in it is like a second brain and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.140" end="00:27:58.210" style="s2">there can be neuro inflammation and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">inflammation can travel upwards to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.210" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">brain and that&#39;s what can cause changes</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:11.650" style="s2">in mode can cause depression there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:14.200" style="s2">also um an increase in cytokines as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.650" end="00:28:16.630" style="s2">chemical mediators which increase</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.200" end="00:28:19.000" style="s2">inflammation the more inflammation there</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.630" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">is in our gut that will travel upwards</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.000" end="00:28:23.620" style="s2">through its exact like a highway a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.490" end="00:28:27.130" style="s2">neurological highway between the gut and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">the brain so even though this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.130" end="00:28:32.920" style="s2">popular idea in functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:34.420" style="s2">world for some time it just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.920" end="00:28:36.130" style="s2">really entered the mainstream it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.420" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">the last couple years thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.130" end="00:28:41.280" style="s2">depression as being largely influenced</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:43.330" style="s2">by a neuro inflammation and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.280" end="00:28:45.490" style="s2">depression almost being thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.330" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">rheumatism of the brain as you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.490" end="00:28:49.750" style="s2">really kind of caught on and that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:51.160" style="s2">don&#39;t think of it that way because I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.750" end="00:28:52.669" style="s2">don&#39;t think of depression is one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.160" end="00:28:54.649" style="s2">think of it as lots of different things</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.669" end="00:28:56.509" style="s2">with different ideologies but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.649" end="00:28:59.269" style="s2">certainly one of them right head trauma</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.509" end="00:29:00.529" style="s2">can do it on its own and just purely</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.269" end="00:29:04.369" style="s2">psycho-emotional things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.529" end="00:29:07.159" style="s2">physiologic can but but whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.369" end="00:29:09.559" style="s2">dealing with mold exposure or some kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.159" end="00:29:11.539" style="s2">of subclinical infection in the body the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.559" end="00:29:13.639" style="s2">idea that it creates inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.539" end="00:29:15.080" style="s2">inflammation that can cross blood-brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.639" end="00:29:16.330" style="s2">barrier and cause more inflammation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.080" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">then the neuro inflammation affects</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.330" end="00:29:21.139" style="s2">brain dynamics whether we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:23.809" style="s2">about depression or anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.139" end="00:29:25.989" style="s2">neurologic issues or brain fog those can</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.809" end="00:29:29.419" style="s2">all be mediated by neuro inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.989" end="00:29:31.519" style="s2">yeah you know autism for instance I</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.419" end="00:29:34.970" style="s2">think there are many many causes for</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.519" end="00:29:36.409" style="s2">autism okay but well one thing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.970" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">research has shown is that children who</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.409" end="00:29:43.159" style="s2">are autistic have a very different um</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">God milieu than unhealthy children oh I</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.159" end="00:29:52.249" style="s2">think that&#39;s one that&#39;s one way to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.980" end="00:29:57.259" style="s2">at one of the factors of autism although</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.249" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">of course it&#39;s if so many so when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.259" end="00:30:03.639" style="s2">think about the gut brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:06.049" style="s2">access I think about at least three</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.639" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">different dynamics one is the enteric</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.049" end="00:30:12.350" style="s2">nervous system right the the neurologic</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:14.330" style="s2">the neurons throughout the GI system</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.350" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">that then send a signal to the brain I</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.330" end="00:30:19.549" style="s2">think about all the chemistry moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:22.629" style="s2">from the gut into the blood which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.549" end="00:30:25.909" style="s2">going to be both nutrients and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.629" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">toxins inflammation etc that can then</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.909" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">affect the environment that the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:32.869" style="s2">system lives in and then I also think</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">about the microbiome and the microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.869" end="00:30:37.070" style="s2">both in terms of the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:38.539" style="s2">modulates genetic expression and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.070" end="00:30:40.879" style="s2">fact that just from a really simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.539" end="00:30:42.590" style="s2">point of view a huge percentage of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.879" end="00:30:45.379" style="s2">primary neurotransmitters are produced</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.590" end="00:30:47.419" style="s2">by the microbiome of the gut and so if</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.379" end="00:30:49.429" style="s2">we&#39;ve got 50 to 80 percent of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.419" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">dopamine serotonin gaba produced by</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.429" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">microbiome and we have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:56.330" style="s2">dysbiosis or infections driving</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">dysbiosis that&#39;s a pretty massive loss</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.330" end="00:30:59.980" style="s2">of transmitter function immediately it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:02.840" style="s2">sure is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.980" end="00:31:05.570" style="s2">so do you do you assess for that do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.840" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">do things like look at neural hormones</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.570" end="00:31:08.690" style="s2">neurotransmitters</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:10.160" style="s2">and look at say gut microbiome an</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.690" end="00:31:12.680" style="s2">infection kind of put those pieces</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.160" end="00:31:15.050" style="s2">together to then assess priority of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:16.910" style="s2">treatments yeah I do so I&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.050" end="00:31:19.970" style="s2">neurotransmitter function usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.910" end="00:31:21.710" style="s2">people&#39;s neurotransmitters are quite low</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.970" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">that&#39;s common especially in complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.710" end="00:31:26.060" style="s2">chronic illness and it&#39;s even common in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:29.180" style="s2">optimizers who&#39;ve just worked so hard</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.060" end="00:31:31.850" style="s2">they tank themselves a little bit so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.180" end="00:31:34.580" style="s2">look at that and I look at their GI</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.850" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">system most of the time when I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.580" end="00:31:42.410" style="s2">at both I&#39;m gonna find dysbiosis in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2">gut mean that link I see very often so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.410" end="00:31:49.250" style="s2">these people will have a lot of yeast</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.950" end="00:31:52.430" style="s2">different fungus is um again smaller</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.250" end="00:31:55.160" style="s2">bacteria those will be seen and usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.430" end="00:31:58.700" style="s2">I want to treat the gut first because</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.160" end="00:32:01.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s insulting um the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.700" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">production of neurotransmitters so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.160" end="00:32:06.290" style="s2">treating the insult first then I work on</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:08.120" style="s2">balancing the neurotransmitters I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.290" end="00:32:11.150" style="s2">layer them in I&#39;ll start working on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.120" end="00:32:13.870" style="s2">gut maybe for a month and then layer in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.150" end="00:32:16.780" style="s2">neurotransmitter treatment on top of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.870" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">concurrently but give a got a head start</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.780" end="00:32:23.090" style="s2">so this is a pretty common best practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">and naturopathic medicine starting the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.090" end="00:32:27.590" style="s2">gut we&#39;ve obviously got the mucosal</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:29.510" style="s2">system which is everywhere that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.590" end="00:32:32.450" style="s2">environment connects to our body that</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.510" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t skin eye sinuses mouth your</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.450" end="00:32:37.610" style="s2">genital bronchioles got you&#39;ve got then</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:38.750" style="s2">into an infection there you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.610" end="00:32:41.210" style="s2">infection in the blood you can have</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.750" end="00:32:47.900" style="s2">infections in the cells why do you start</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.210" end="00:32:48.920" style="s2">with the gut that is the production of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.900" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">the immune system</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.920" end="00:32:57.830" style="s2">and and that&#39;s where all begins ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:59.390" style="s2">oftentimes of people have mycotoxins or</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.830" end="00:33:01.340" style="s2">fungus and their sinuses I may start</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.390" end="00:33:04.430" style="s2">with their sinuses first because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.340" end="00:33:06.770" style="s2">such a bony concentrated area I just I</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.430" end="00:33:09.650" style="s2">just want to give them some relief and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.770" end="00:33:11.870" style="s2">also know that infections from here they</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.650" end="00:33:14.300" style="s2">travel downwards quickly so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.870" end="00:33:17.060" style="s2">clear this up first and then I&#39;ll go the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.300" end="00:33:19.940" style="s2">gut depending on on the severity of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.060" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">science infection I see a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.940" end="00:33:27.820" style="s2">quite severity in their sinuses and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:31.090" style="s2">proximal to the brain is relevant mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.820" end="00:33:34.279" style="s2">same with dental infection that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.090" end="00:33:35.929" style="s2">corner wouldn&#39;t be extent infections for</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.279" end="00:33:38.059" style="s2">sure say that again</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.929" end="00:33:41.210" style="s2">people turn up people turn a corner in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.059" end="00:33:43.129" style="s2">complex chronic illness big circle</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.210" end="00:33:46.789" style="s2">dental infections so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.129" end="00:33:49.879" style="s2">that I think as far as biologic</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.789" end="00:33:52.009" style="s2">dentistry goes most people are aware</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.879" end="00:33:55.429" style="s2">that mercury fillings are a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.009" end="00:33:58.519" style="s2">and that may be the proper removal of</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.429" end="00:34:00.289" style="s2">mercury is a good idea I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.519" end="00:34:02.179" style="s2">the most common idea the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.289" end="00:34:04.639" style="s2">subclinical infection other than</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.179" end="00:34:06.919" style="s2">systemic gingivitis is a less well-known</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.639" end="00:34:09.169" style="s2">idea do you want to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.919" end="00:34:13.399" style="s2">definitely but I also want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.169" end="00:34:15.020" style="s2">the mercury first you&#39;ll be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.399" end="00:34:17.720" style="s2">how many people come to me saying that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.020" end="00:34:20.899" style="s2">they had their metal amalgams removed by</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.720" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">a non-biological dentist have swallowed</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.899" end="00:34:26.389" style="s2">the mercury is vaporized up and they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:29.389" style="s2">sick yeah and and I will measure their</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.389" end="00:34:31.550" style="s2">blood murky it&#39;s high I&#39;ll do we are in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.389" end="00:34:34.220" style="s2">provoked test that&#39;s high and once we</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.550" end="00:34:35.929" style="s2">start to get the mercury out there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.220" end="00:34:37.849" style="s2">big difference in their cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.929" end="00:34:41.179" style="s2">some of them have come with neurological</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.849" end="00:34:44.419" style="s2">symptoms as well those as well shift so</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.179" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">the the best practice there is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.419" end="00:34:46.609" style="s2">gonna remove mercury go to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:51.470" style="s2">actually knows what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.609" end="00:34:53.060" style="s2">exactly systemic dentist so I pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.470" end="00:34:55.250" style="s2">much always recommend people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.060" end="00:34:59.990" style="s2">trained in Huggins protocol is that also</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.250" end="00:35:02.839" style="s2">you do yeah all right so speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.990" end="00:35:10.150" style="s2">Huggins protocol let&#39;s continue on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.839" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">topic of sub acute dental infections so</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.150" end="00:35:16.040" style="s2">root canals have been improperly</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">improperly extracted I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.040" end="00:35:20.510" style="s2">backtrack when wisdom teeth have been</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:22.910" style="s2">improperly extracted and underneath root</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.510" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">canals there can be some clinical</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.910" end="00:35:28.359" style="s2">infections so in addition a small idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:31.640" style="s2">they&#39;re asymptomatic they can&#39;t feel it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.359" end="00:35:33.800" style="s2">but they have a lot of brain fog I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.640" end="00:35:36.950" style="s2">have headaches diminish</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.800" end="00:35:39.740" style="s2">trigeminal neuralgia they have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.950" end="00:35:41.990" style="s2">there&#39;s an infection in their jaw so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.740" end="00:35:44.180" style="s2">asked them have you had your wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.990" end="00:35:47.180" style="s2">teeth extracted do you have root canals</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.180" end="00:35:48.950" style="s2">okay so when people have infections up</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.180" end="00:35:51.590" style="s2">in here those are my two questions right</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.950" end="00:35:54.830" style="s2">away I send them to a biologic slash</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.590" end="00:35:58.760" style="s2">systemic dentist because those dentists</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.830" end="00:36:01.970" style="s2">have what&#39;s called a CT scan and a cat</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.760" end="00:36:04.940" style="s2">an ikat annsofi t scan which allows us</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.970" end="00:36:06.980" style="s2">to see small slices of the bone and find</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.940" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">localized infections which aren&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.980" end="00:36:12.290" style="s2">on regular panorex digital x-rays but</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">not seen with the naked eye they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.290" end="00:36:17.960" style="s2">they&#39;re missed in traditional dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:20.840" style="s2">just downright missed okay and so once</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.960" end="00:36:24.530" style="s2">those infections are cleaned up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.840" end="00:36:29.150" style="s2">when I see a lot of head symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.530" end="00:36:31.370" style="s2">resolved do you run the Huggins PCR</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.150" end="00:36:34.610" style="s2">assessments for infection also to look</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.370" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">at the species and load our biological</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.610" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">dentist does yeah yeah you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:42.260" style="s2">surprised by what comes back yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:43.910" style="s2">interesting infections yeah so so will</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.260" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">you explain for people what is an</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.910" end="00:36:47.450" style="s2">improper extraction and why would that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:51.470" style="s2">lead to infection and why would root</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.450" end="00:36:55.220" style="s2">canal leak infection you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.470" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">small they&#39;re small areas an improper</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.220" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">extraction could be leaving an area not</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">sutured well not closed well it stays</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:10.220" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:14.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve had people I had had a material</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.220" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">like gauze left in there um then they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.030" end="00:37:18.140" style="s2">had had to have the gauze removed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:19.820" style="s2">then it doesn&#39;t heal that doesn&#39;t heal</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.140" end="00:37:22.670" style="s2">properly so there&#39;s there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.820" end="00:37:26.390" style="s2">different ways when the surgery isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.670" end="00:37:28.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t quite quite perfect and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.390" end="00:37:32.420" style="s2">finicky some area and like I said before</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.820" end="00:37:35.630" style="s2">a lot of bone in there small compact</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.420" end="00:37:38.060" style="s2">areas so that&#39;s when infections can</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.630" end="00:37:40.580" style="s2">happen I think with regard to extraction</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.060" end="00:37:43.130" style="s2">what wisdom teeth or other extractions</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.580" end="00:37:45.500" style="s2">one of the common things is even if the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.130" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">surgery is done well there is a ligament</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.500" end="00:37:49.560" style="s2">that connects the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">to the bone and that if Seligman is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.560" end="00:37:53.640" style="s2">fully removed then it&#39;s dead tissue and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:57.060" style="s2">then how did the body or a tissue</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.640" end="00:37:59.340" style="s2">typically that&#39;s a microbes job and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.060" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">then you have a pocket that with some</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.340" end="00:38:03.600" style="s2">dead tissue in it where you end up</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.100" style="s2">having breeding ground for microbe also</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.600" end="00:38:06.630" style="s2">if there was infection in the tooth to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:07.890" style="s2">begin with it might have gone into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.630" end="00:38:10.590" style="s2">bone if it wasn&#39;t cleaned all the way so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.890" end="00:38:13.320" style="s2">the Huggins protocol is process for they</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.590" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">make sure to go it get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.320" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">ligament go into the bone stimulate bone</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.660" end="00:38:20.280" style="s2">bleeding so it actually heals more</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:21.960" style="s2">deeply and you get you get removal of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.280" end="00:38:24.750" style="s2">the infection and no dead tissue left</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.960" end="00:38:28.110" style="s2">right which is the same thing with root</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.750" end="00:38:29.640" style="s2">canal in terms of dead tissue right you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.110" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">end up getting a tooth left it has no</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.640" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">immune system in it but is permeable so</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:39.060" style="s2">that all those miles of dentin tubules</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:41.100" style="s2">can be a place that infection can hide</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.060" end="00:38:43.380" style="s2">out yeah and then those infections</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.100" end="00:38:45.720" style="s2">travel they can travel upwards towards</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.380" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">the brain they can travel down so</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.720" end="00:38:52.860" style="s2">infections travel biotoxins trouble</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">inflammation from those sites the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.860" end="00:38:58.470" style="s2">goes with fineness NEC issues so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:39:00.390" style="s2">talk about the sinus thing right so with</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.470" end="00:39:02.850" style="s2">the dental infections someone kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.390" end="00:39:04.140" style="s2">dental infection where they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.850" end="00:39:05.430" style="s2">go to their normal dentists and their</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.140" end="00:39:07.080" style="s2">Dennis&#39;s everything&#39;s fine right</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.430" end="00:39:08.610" style="s2">they don&#39;t have dental issues they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.080" end="00:39:10.050" style="s2">have gingivitis because if we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.610" end="00:39:12.090" style="s2">at something that&#39;s maybe at the very</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.050" end="00:39:14.100" style="s2">root of a root canal tooth you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.090" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">gonna see that unless you do one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.100" end="00:39:21.330" style="s2">those diagnostics that we discussed but</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.140" end="00:39:23.640" style="s2">it might be affecting ongoing immune and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.330" end="00:39:25.310" style="s2">inflammatory dynamics to the blood so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.640" end="00:39:27.240" style="s2">the the thing that might get better</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.310" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">right the thing that might have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.240" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">worse is over the course of ten or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:33.360" style="s2">twenty years some very slow just effect</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:35.640" style="s2">on decreased homeo dynamics of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.360" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">system and what might get better is some</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.640" end="00:39:41.670" style="s2">systemic thing that&#39;s not localized at</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:45.830" style="s2">all right so the key thing there is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.670" end="00:39:50.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not looking at mouth issues as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.830" end="00:39:54.060" style="s2">symptom to assess we&#39;re looking at any</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.520" end="00:39:56.550" style="s2">kind of systemic issues right so sinus a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.060" end="00:39:57.570" style="s2">similar ring series so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.550" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">talking about people who have chronic</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.570" end="00:40:03.369" style="s2">sinus infections only know</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">definitely not so then what would</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.369" end="00:40:07.119" style="s2">indicate for you and then how would you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:09.759" style="s2">go about testing in sections and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.119" end="00:40:13.240" style="s2">sinuses yeah so it&#39;s often people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.759" end="00:40:15.400" style="s2">had mold exposure they know they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.240" end="00:40:17.859" style="s2">in a water damaged place a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.400" end="00:40:20.170" style="s2">come to me for a mold exposure because</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.859" end="00:40:25.210" style="s2">all of a sudden they are sick when they</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.170" end="00:40:27.130" style="s2">were fine and I know I want to test</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.210" end="00:40:30.099" style="s2">their sinuses right away you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.130" end="00:40:34.150" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been breathing that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.099" end="00:40:35.559" style="s2">um a test from Mark Long&#39;s which is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.150" end="00:40:39.249" style="s2">kind of staph infection that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.559" end="00:40:41.170" style="s2">antibiotic resistant Louis resistant to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.249" end="00:40:43.749" style="s2">many different antibiotics that&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.170" end="00:40:46.059" style="s2">and people will find toxin illness mold</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.749" end="00:40:48.490" style="s2">illness and mine so I&#39;ll test from our</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.059" end="00:40:51.339" style="s2">cons test for other funguses and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.490" end="00:40:54.849" style="s2">bacteria very typically I find those</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.339" end="00:40:58.599" style="s2">things this is a swab swab measles</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.849" end="00:41:00.130" style="s2">yellow so if someone can come see a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.599" end="00:41:03.099" style="s2">functional medicine doctor get a swab</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.130" end="00:41:03.849" style="s2">check it out treat it awesome if if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.099" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.849" end="00:41:08.980" style="s2">what does I&#39;m switching to treatment I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:11.759" style="s2">bouncing around a little bit but what if</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.980" end="00:41:14.680" style="s2">something someone can do for sinus</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.759" end="00:41:17.230" style="s2">hygiene on their own that can help to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.680" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">decrease infectious load in the sinuses</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.230" end="00:41:25.539" style="s2">it can do neti pot rinses oh just some</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">filtered water put a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.539" end="00:41:30.339" style="s2">little bit of salt in there hey then he</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:34.329" style="s2">popped both sides that really helps</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.339" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">clear things out they can use I really</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.329" end="00:41:39.160" style="s2">am a fan of argent and silver so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:40.869" style="s2">can also help clear out infections</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.160" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">there&#39;s they can nebulize it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.869" end="00:41:47.739" style="s2">nasal sprays for it as well or put it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:53.309" style="s2">the neti pot exactly how about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.739" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">xylitol nasal sprays yep back to so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.309" end="00:41:57.369" style="s2">think that you know unless someone has</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:00.130" style="s2">an Ayurvedic background most people</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.369" end="00:42:02.829" style="s2">don&#39;t think of nasal cleaning as part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.130" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">their daily or regular hygiene like they</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.829" end="00:42:08.200" style="s2">think of teeth cleaning but you would</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:10.390" style="s2">suggest that people do I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.200" end="00:42:12.430" style="s2">I suggest think do it on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.390" end="00:42:13.530" style="s2">at least three times a week you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.430" end="00:42:15.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.530" end="00:42:18.150" style="s2">a place where we can harbor bugs for</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.210" end="00:42:20.760" style="s2">sure we have more cysts more of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.150" end="00:42:23.700" style="s2">susceptibility to bugs now than we ever</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.760" end="00:42:27.450" style="s2">did before due to environmental toxins</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.700" end="00:42:28.890" style="s2">and yeah and travel where the bugs from</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.450" end="00:42:32.790" style="s2">any part of the world are now everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.890" end="00:42:35.880" style="s2">and antibiotic resistance and pesticide</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.790" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">use and etc yeah and also I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.880" end="00:42:40.740" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an obsession with over</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.220" end="00:42:45.030" style="s2">sanitizing and people using too much</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.740" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">Purell it it too much hand sanitizer not</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.030" end="00:42:48.090" style="s2">letting children play in the dirt we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:51.360" style="s2">not allowing our immune systems to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.090" end="00:42:53.670" style="s2">exposed to the beneficial bacteria which</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.360" end="00:42:57.810" style="s2">allow our immune system to become</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.670" end="00:43:01.230" style="s2">stronger so actually on that topic when</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.810" end="00:43:03.780" style="s2">you think about using germicidal soaps</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.230" end="00:43:06.300" style="s2">the triclosan which is the most common</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.780" end="00:43:08.100" style="s2">actual antibiotic put in the soaps how</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.300" end="00:43:14.340" style="s2">often do you see that show up when</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.100" end="00:43:20.100" style="s2">you&#39;re doing environmental toxicity to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.340" end="00:43:21.720" style="s2">cancer and the link to antibiotic</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.100" end="00:43:24.690" style="s2">resistance of any infections that happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.720" end="00:43:27.890" style="s2">to be there yeah mm-hmm yeah I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.690" end="00:43:30.930" style="s2">lot of triclosan show up on on</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.890" end="00:43:33.570" style="s2">toxicology profiles also yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.930" end="00:43:34.830" style="s2">typically find that addressing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.570" end="00:43:36.690" style="s2">infections and those people takes more</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.830" end="00:43:39.030" style="s2">work it does I also see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.690" end="00:43:40.620" style="s2">parabens show up so those are beauty</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.030" end="00:43:44.220" style="s2">products and our show and our and our</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.620" end="00:43:46.440" style="s2">soaps and shampoos and and makeup so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:51.570" style="s2">know there&#39;s a whole new trend towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.440" end="00:43:54.570" style="s2">holistic beauty as well and so similarly</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:56.430" style="s2">if someone was gonna want to have a hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.570" end="00:44:01.500" style="s2">soap that had some antibacterial</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.430" end="00:44:07.740" style="s2">properties essential oils yeah lavender</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.500" end="00:44:09.720" style="s2">tea tree thyme oregano yeah okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.740" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">talked about hygiene for the nose how</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.720" end="00:44:13.170" style="s2">about when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:16.260" style="s2">subclinical infections in the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.170" end="00:44:17.640" style="s2">hygiene for the mouth this sides going</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.260" end="00:44:19.560" style="s2">to see a biologic dentist and get those</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.640" end="00:44:21.960" style="s2">primary things done are there any things</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.560" end="00:44:24.450" style="s2">beyond just basic teeth brushing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:26.850" style="s2">recommend yeah for sure flossing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.450" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">basic but it&#39;s so important because that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.850" end="00:44:32.850" style="s2">that&#39;s right in the tissues but um oil</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:34.410" style="s2">pulling can really help tunnel scraping</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.850" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">now we&#39;re talking about more Ayurvedic</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.410" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">methods but maybe shirt later work so</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:41.910" style="s2">describe those two because oil pulling</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:43.410" style="s2">oil pulling in tongue scraping are both</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.910" end="00:44:46.350" style="s2">Ayurvedic but they might not be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.410" end="00:44:49.740" style="s2">to everybody yeah so sometimes freaking</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.350" end="00:44:52.230" style="s2">a little tool which I&#39;m actually you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.740" end="00:44:56.010" style="s2">take that tool and you brush it against</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.230" end="00:45:00.860" style="s2">your tongue and it removes biofilm and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.010" end="00:45:03.870" style="s2">coatings from those little bugs and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.860" end="00:45:06.660" style="s2">then gargling with salt after that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.870" end="00:45:10.920" style="s2">know and then oil pulling is is taking</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.660" end="00:45:13.530" style="s2">um oil which has antimicrobial effects</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.920" end="00:45:16.350" style="s2">and and um holding it in the mouth and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.530" end="00:45:19.470" style="s2">and swishing it around and that also</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.350" end="00:45:23.100" style="s2">pulls pulls microbes the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.470" end="00:45:26.340" style="s2">generally recommend having people do the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.100" end="00:45:28.200" style="s2">oil pulling is whether it&#39;s coconut oil</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.340" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">or sesame oil or they get a specialized</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.200" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">oil pulling premade product that has</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:37.290" style="s2">essential oils in it is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.910" style="s2">actually vigorously swishing until the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.290" end="00:45:41.880" style="s2">oil and saliva have mixed and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.910" end="00:45:43.470" style="s2">actually looks like saliva it looks</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.880" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">white rather than yellow when they spit</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.470" end="00:45:50.730" style="s2">usually ten or fifteen minutes and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:53.090" style="s2">the hypothesis there is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.730" end="00:45:56.040" style="s2">some antimicrobial properties in the oil</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.090" end="00:45:57.750" style="s2">that it helps the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.040" end="00:46:04.370" style="s2">tissues the gums right it&#39;s emollient</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.750" end="00:46:08.010" style="s2">but also that as as an oil as a fat that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.370" end="00:46:09.810" style="s2">it creates an osmotic pressure for fat</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.010" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">soluble toxins to come into the oil and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.810" end="00:46:14.310" style="s2">then get spit out so it is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:16.350" style="s2">detox um fat soluble toxins which</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.310" end="00:46:20.550" style="s2">supposedly has been microscopy verified</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.350" end="00:46:24.780" style="s2">I can&#39;t verify that myself but yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.550" end="00:46:27.510" style="s2">about water picking I can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.780" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">help clean between the gums for sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.510" end="00:46:32.250" style="s2">that can be food stuck in there unless</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:35.940" style="s2">of course we&#39;ll track microbes but just</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.250" end="00:46:39.180" style="s2">washing that out yeah I do uh I add</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.940" end="00:46:40.130" style="s2">silver to the water pick and use that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.180" end="00:46:42.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.130" end="00:46:45.410" style="s2">decreases the chance of deep pockets</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.760" end="00:46:49.010" style="s2">definitely the silver will kill off</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.410" end="00:46:51.740" style="s2">microbes as well alright good so then</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.010" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">what about to where we&#39;re discussing now</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.740" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">some kind of home methods people can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:46:58.580" style="s2">outside of the medical therapies so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:00.350" style="s2">about with the gut we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.580" end="00:47:01.970" style="s2">you know if someone actually has</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.350" end="00:47:03.860" style="s2">microscopic parasites in the gut they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.970" end="00:47:05.870" style="s2">gonna have to go get appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.860" end="00:47:08.590" style="s2">diagnosis treat that it&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.870" end="00:47:10.910" style="s2">involve meds if they&#39;ve got dysbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.590" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">protozoa those are gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.910" end="00:47:15.500" style="s2">customized protocols if someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:16.700" style="s2">have the resources to go work with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.500" end="00:47:19.790" style="s2">functional medicine doctor right away</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.380" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">antibiotics like they for sure there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.090" end="00:48:14.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a place for antibiotics I will</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:16.760" style="s2">prescribe them to people</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.150" end="00:48:18.730" style="s2">no and unnecessary but there&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.760" end="00:48:21.290" style="s2">often over prescribed and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.730" end="00:48:23.410" style="s2">prescribed when they&#39;re not needed so to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.290" end="00:48:25.720" style="s2">avoid the overuse of antibiotics</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.410" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">definitely to avoid processed sugar</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">processed foods those feed the bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.420" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">bacteria artificial sweeteners</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:37.010" style="s2">artificial foods and preservatives feed</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:40.010" style="s2">the pathogenic bugs mm-hmm and what do</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.010" end="00:48:41.150" style="s2">you think about for GI system in</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.010" end="00:48:46.310" style="s2">particular what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.150" end="00:48:48.590" style="s2">fasting and fasting colonics</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.310" end="00:48:50.360" style="s2">salt water flushes other things for kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.590" end="00:48:52.340" style="s2">of taking the load off the GI system</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.360" end="00:48:52.710" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s important to have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.340" end="00:48:55.079" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:59.809" style="s2">and a rectal route when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.079" end="00:49:01.559" style="s2">clean the system so colonics definitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.809" end="00:49:06.569" style="s2">especially when returning get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.559" end="00:49:10.020" style="s2">parasites animals for sure what else did</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.569" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">you ask about fasting fasting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.020" end="00:49:14.460" style="s2">fasting it depends depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">people can tolerate but if people can</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.460" end="00:49:20.490" style="s2">tolerate even a bone broth fast just for</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:22.289" style="s2">three days that can really help to fix</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.490" end="00:49:24.660" style="s2">leaky gut syndrome it can help to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.289" end="00:49:28.710" style="s2">restore the permeability of the gut</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.660" end="00:49:31.109" style="s2">membrane a water fast can help to reset</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.710" end="00:49:33.569" style="s2">the metabolism some people can tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.109" end="00:49:36.599" style="s2">it so you know it depends on on</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.569" end="00:49:41.099" style="s2">tolerance but those who can tolerate it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.599" end="00:49:43.170" style="s2">can help reset the system so talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.099" end="00:49:45.539" style="s2">about infections in other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.170" end="00:49:48.599" style="s2">body so we&#39;ve mostly talked about within</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.539" end="00:49:52.349" style="s2">the GI system so far including the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.599" end="00:49:53.910" style="s2">and then the the nasal and sinuses were</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.349" end="00:49:58.109" style="s2">just still part of the mucosal system</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.910" end="00:50:01.260" style="s2">talk to me about like infections in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.109" end="00:50:03.869" style="s2">prostate and urogenital kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.260" end="00:50:06.270" style="s2">infections yeah they&#39;re common I see</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.869" end="00:50:08.910" style="s2">them I see them commonly actually in</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.270" end="00:50:11.880" style="s2">people who have autoimmune conditions</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:16.289" style="s2">and complex chronic illness you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.880" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">that the basic UTI shows up in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.289" end="00:50:22.140" style="s2">general population as well but I do see</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:25.529" style="s2">these infections recurrent for people</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.140" end="00:50:28.470" style="s2">who are sick so we work with that with</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.529" end="00:50:30.450" style="s2">those herbal II just at one I want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.470" end="00:50:32.069" style="s2">start with the gut because the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.450" end="00:50:33.900" style="s2">inflammation I believe starts and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.069" end="00:50:38.609" style="s2">they&#39;ve got and it can work its way down</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.900" end="00:50:40.890" style="s2">to go to the lower areas what have you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.609" end="00:50:43.319" style="s2">noticed about the relationship I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.890" end="00:50:45.270" style="s2">you worked at an integrative oncology</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.319" end="00:50:47.250" style="s2">center have you noticed about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.270" end="00:50:50.549" style="s2">relationship of say you know people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.250" end="00:50:53.160" style="s2">prostate cancer elevated PSA leading in</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.549" end="00:50:55.049" style="s2">the prostate cancer and increased</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.160" end="00:50:56.970" style="s2">infectious load prostate infection</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.049" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">have you noticed those I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.970" end="00:51:02.039" style="s2">we know cervical cancer in HPV right</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of clinical research on</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.039" end="00:51:06.390" style="s2">the HPV EBV mycoplasma and prostate</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.299" style="s2">cancer</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.390" end="00:51:12.119" style="s2">you speak to that yeah we can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.299" end="00:51:15.740" style="s2">definitely test it for those you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.119" end="00:51:18.089" style="s2">for the toxic load and people of them</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.740" end="00:51:19.670" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say toxic load the microbial</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.089" end="00:51:22.799" style="s2">load again through a stool test</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.670" end="00:51:27.150" style="s2">definitely I&#39;ve seen correlations there</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.799" end="00:51:30.660" style="s2">and I think that um I think it is is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.150" end="00:51:34.039" style="s2">it&#39;s the toxins and again sorry the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.660" end="00:51:37.079" style="s2">biotoxins that those microbes spit out</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.039" end="00:51:40.140" style="s2">that that caused inflammation in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.079" end="00:51:44.730" style="s2">body travel downwards and then such</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.140" end="00:51:48.359" style="s2">close proximity to the gut so when</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.730" end="00:51:50.539" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about cognitive health</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.359" end="00:51:53.609" style="s2">mental emotional health obviously</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.539" end="00:51:57.260" style="s2">infection is one component right</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.609" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">obviously nutrition is a component and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.260" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">hormones are a component there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:04.140" style="s2">number of physiologic components</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:05.940" style="s2">biotoxins are a component and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.140" end="00:52:07.470" style="s2">obviously you have to address psychology</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.940" end="00:52:11.849" style="s2">and their actual life right</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.470" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">relationships how often when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.849" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">dealing with mental emotional dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:16.410" style="s2">for people that have a physiologic</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:18.210" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.410" end="00:52:22.950" style="s2">do you see infection or at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.210" end="00:52:25.099" style="s2">dysbiosis involved all the time but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.950" end="00:52:27.559" style="s2">thing is that people who come to me are</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.099" end="00:52:30.420" style="s2">half more than half them are complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.559" end="00:52:32.700" style="s2">chronically ill patients right away I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.420" end="00:52:34.650" style="s2">searched for infections and I find them</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.700" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">and you know research has shown that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.650" end="00:52:40.230" style="s2">people with complex chronic illness are</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:43.559" style="s2">more prone to depression and anxiety so</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.230" end="00:52:47.730" style="s2">I see those hand-in-hand every day many</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.559" end="00:52:49.289" style="s2">times every day so are there any other</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.730" end="00:52:51.660" style="s2">recommendations you want to share you</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.880" end="00:53:04.650" style="s2">decrease infectious burden and increase</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.460" end="00:53:06.269" style="s2">immune function systemically what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.650" end="00:53:09.539" style="s2">other home recommendations that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.269" end="00:53:13.950" style="s2">generally a good idea for people yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.539" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">you know definitely um my patients</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.950" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">travel a lot and to be careful when when</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:23.730" style="s2">traveling and even when camping</p>

<p begin="00:53:23.730" end="00:53:29.730" style="s2">developing countries to make sure your</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:31.110" style="s2">fruits and vegetables are cooked and at</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.730" end="00:53:33.240" style="s2">home to make sure your fruits and</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.230" end="00:53:42.630" style="s2">leafy vegetables there are some really</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.540" end="00:53:46.230" style="s2">tiny bugs that can get stuck in there we</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.630" end="00:53:48.600" style="s2">can eat them and they can they can cause</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.230" end="00:53:50.420" style="s2">trouble for us as well and you obviously</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.600" end="00:53:51.990" style="s2">don&#39;t just mean bugs you mean eggs</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.420" end="00:53:54.090" style="s2">they&#39;re invisible</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.990" end="00:53:56.040" style="s2">hey do you know what is washed</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.090" end="00:54:00.750" style="s2">thoroughly mean just like a couple drops</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.040" end="00:54:02.550" style="s2">of hydrogen peroxide or vinegar in in in</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.750" end="00:54:06.120" style="s2">in the sink that you filled with water</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.550" end="00:54:07.560" style="s2">leave leave your vegetables or fruit in</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.120" end="00:54:10.410" style="s2">there but particularly the ones with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.560" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">small leafy&#39;s well like ten minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.410" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">then wash that off thoroughly with water</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:17.340" style="s2">that helps that&#39;s a pretty extreme</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:20.190" style="s2">measure but these are for people who you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.340" end="00:54:22.590" style="s2">have a propensity to illness for sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.190" end="00:54:25.530" style="s2">and that might be many things but one</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.590" end="00:54:27.780" style="s2">part of propensity to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.530" end="00:54:28.890" style="s2">infection from what someone needs and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.780" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">their fruits and vegetables would have</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.890" end="00:54:33.750" style="s2">to do with their stomach acid levels</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:36.630" style="s2">right so mmm</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.750" end="00:54:40.020" style="s2">any any thoughts or guidelines on</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.630" end="00:54:43.350" style="s2">increasing hydrochloric acid production</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.020" end="00:54:46.890" style="s2">and as a first part of stomach community</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.350" end="00:54:49.410" style="s2">of GI immunity yeah you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.890" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">actually take um you can take a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.410" end="00:54:55.410" style="s2">bit of hydrochloric acid if you have if</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:57.390" style="s2">you tend to have um reflux it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.410" end="00:55:01.770" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have enough acid which</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.390" end="00:55:06.030" style="s2">is listings countered to it intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.770" end="00:55:08.010" style="s2">but not enough acid in in in the stomach</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.030" end="00:55:10.980" style="s2">causes the sphincter to actually open</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.010" end="00:55:13.140" style="s2">and release acid upwards so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.980" end="00:55:15.360" style="s2">happening then for sure that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.140" end="00:55:17.670" style="s2">often a diagnostic of not having enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.360" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2">acid I&#39;ll just give people some a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.670" end="00:55:25.170" style="s2">bit of hydrochloric acid supplement to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">take um having a more alkaline diet can</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.170" end="00:55:34.200" style="s2">help as well so say what the rough</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:39.000" style="s2">overview of that is yeah so um definite</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.200" end="00:55:42.390" style="s2">high-end veggies high in fruit not not</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.000" end="00:55:46.050" style="s2">fruit that some have a high glycemic</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.390" end="00:55:48.210" style="s2">load not super sugary fruits of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.050" end="00:55:50.849" style="s2">you can enjoy those as well but you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.210" end="00:55:55.640" style="s2">to have those limited a lot of veggies</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.849" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">low and grains mostly paleo style</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.640" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">unsustainable meats if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:06.119" style="s2">books on diet nutrition that you think</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.839" end="00:56:09.510" style="s2">are good starter books for people you</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.119" end="00:56:12.420" style="s2">like to recommend yeah um Kim Schneider</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.510" end="00:56:14.940" style="s2">I like her book doctor Perlmutter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.420" end="00:56:17.430" style="s2">books are interesting things doctor</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.940" end="00:56:24.320" style="s2">Gondry&#39;s books those are interesting as</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.430" end="00:56:29.130" style="s2">well plant paradox yes yeah okay and</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.130" end="00:56:36.930" style="s2">to really address the topic of their</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:38.220" style="s2">microbiome and infection this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.930" end="00:56:40.310" style="s2">something that&#39;s very well served</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.220" end="00:56:43.260" style="s2">working with a functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.310" end="00:56:44.940" style="s2">integrative medicine doctor that can do</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.260" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">the appropriate assessment and treatment</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.940" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">protocols what do you recommend someone</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:52.859" style="s2">look for if they&#39;re wanting to find a</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.859" end="00:56:58.650" style="s2">things I think doctors are very highly</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.609" end="00:57:00.540" style="s2">trained in in frontal medicine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.650" end="00:57:03.450" style="s2">where functional medicine began really</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.540" end="00:57:05.910" style="s2">for and MDS who&#39;ve had a functional</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.450" end="00:57:08.369" style="s2">medicine training also quite wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.910" end="00:57:10.230" style="s2">as well so definitely to have some do</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.250" end="00:57:18.780" style="s2">got some functional medicine training</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.750" end="00:57:21.210" style="s2">now for the training around parasites</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.780" end="00:57:25.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different ballgame</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.210" end="00:57:26.910" style="s2">that&#39;s not taught that&#39;s not taught in</p>

<p begin="00:57:48.120" end="00:57:52.540" style="s2">that&#39;s rare to find in our education</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.620" end="00:57:53.920" style="s2">system and did you say when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.540" end="00:57:56.890" style="s2">talking earlier that for people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:58.570" style="s2">listen this podcast who happened to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.890" end="00:58:00.310" style="s2">in or could come to the Bay Area and</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.570" end="00:58:01.870" style="s2">want to come to Gordon medical and work</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.310" end="00:58:04.690" style="s2">with you work with the doc said that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.870" end="00:58:07.600" style="s2">had something to offer yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.690" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">for so patients how many patients who</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.600" end="00:58:12.700" style="s2">are here let&#39;s think of this podcast if</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:15.640" style="s2">they&#39;re new to me you know for 150</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.700" end="00:58:18.670" style="s2">dollars off an initial visit with me and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.640" end="00:58:22.570" style="s2">for existing patients 150 dollars off of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.670" end="00:58:24.730" style="s2">any new procedure with me awesome is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.570" end="00:58:26.740" style="s2">there any like a code that someone would</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.730" end="00:58:32.110" style="s2">need to use yeah let&#39;s use a code neuro</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.740" end="00:58:34.170" style="s2">hacker okay that&#39;s fun alright so this</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.110" end="00:58:39.790" style="s2">is I think this is a good introduction</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.170" end="00:58:41.950" style="s2">to the topic of subacute you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.790" end="00:58:44.890" style="s2">subclinical chronic infections and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.950" end="00:58:47.080" style="s2">this has a role in you know possibly has</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.890" end="00:58:48.700" style="s2">a role in cancer autoimmunity nerd ijen</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.080" end="00:58:55.090" style="s2">chronic illness fatigue energy but also</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.700" end="00:58:58.060" style="s2">in mental emotional health and and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.090" end="00:59:00.130" style="s2">people want to you know come work with</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.060" end="00:59:01.390" style="s2">you awesome if they want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.130" end="00:59:03.580" style="s2">find someone you give them some</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.390" end="00:59:05.590" style="s2">resources to find but it anyone working</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.580" end="00:59:07.810" style="s2">on chronic illness knows that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.590" end="00:59:09.790" style="s2">lot of personal responsibility they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.810" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">to take to figure this out because</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.790" end="00:59:13.600" style="s2">typically they&#39;re working with a number</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:14.740" style="s2">of different doctors and therapists to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.600" end="00:59:17.890" style="s2">kind of figure out what they actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.740" end="00:59:20.260" style="s2">need is there anything else that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.890" end="00:59:22.000" style="s2">like to share with people today just</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.260" end="00:59:24.760" style="s2">kind of closing thoughts on these topics</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.000" end="00:59:26.440" style="s2">yeah yeah these complex chronic</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.760" end="00:59:30.370" style="s2">illnesses can happen to anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.440" end="00:59:33.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what I see and it&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.370" end="00:59:35.560" style="s2">what surprises me every time actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.340" end="00:59:38.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.560" end="00:59:40.570" style="s2">hundreds of these cases every time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.200" end="00:59:43.240" style="s2">a bit of a surprise how healthy the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.570" end="00:59:46.360" style="s2">person was before how functional they</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.240" end="00:59:48.100" style="s2">were how driven and engaged they were in</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.360" end="00:59:50.970" style="s2">their lives suddenly something happens</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.100" end="00:59:54.610" style="s2">in life it&#39;s just not the same anymore</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.970" end="00:59:56.710" style="s2">so prevention is really really important</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.610" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">so getting diagnostics and understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.710" end="01:00:01.240" style="s2">what is underneath all of this I want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.680" end="01:00:04.440" style="s2">talk a little bit about medical</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.240" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">actually and we didn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.440" end="01:00:12.820" style="s2">Diagnostics but medical omics is um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:15.490" style="s2">actually research that Gordon medical is</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.820" end="01:00:18.790" style="s2">doing with dr. Bob not na vo and UC San</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.490" end="01:00:22.780" style="s2">Diego and it is a test we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.790" end="01:00:26.020" style="s2">biochemical markers in real time so it</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.780" end="01:00:27.550" style="s2">can predict your health and it can</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.020" end="01:00:29.230" style="s2">predict illness in a way that nothing</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.550" end="01:00:32.680" style="s2">else can so it&#39;s looking at organic</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:34.840" style="s2">acids amino acids vitamins minerals</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.680" end="01:00:38.560" style="s2">different lipids in a way that no other</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.840" end="01:00:41.320" style="s2">tests can right now research is still</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.560" end="01:00:42.310" style="s2">being done but it&#39;s predicted so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.320" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">know we learned from the human genome</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.310" end="01:00:51.180" style="s2">product project that you know genes are</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:55.990" style="s2">only predictive of 10% of our illnesses</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.180" end="01:01:00.250" style="s2">metabolomics is looking at these</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.990" end="01:01:03.250" style="s2">chemicals in real time and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.250" end="01:01:06.130" style="s2">looking at the cross between your genes</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.250" end="01:01:09.970" style="s2">and toxicity or your genes and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.130" end="01:01:14.620" style="s2">is is approaching you to create either</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.970" end="01:01:16.870" style="s2">either wellness or illness so it that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.620" end="01:01:19.000" style="s2">I think it&#39;s going to change the face of</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.870" end="01:01:21.610" style="s2">medicine so I mean I&#39;m excited to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.000" end="01:01:24.250" style="s2">involved in that yeah and to the work</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.610" end="01:01:25.780" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it at Gordon medical is one</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.250" end="01:01:28.660" style="s2">of the few facilities that I know of</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.780" end="01:01:31.230" style="s2">that&#39;s actually doing cutting-edge</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.660" end="01:01:34.630" style="s2">research grade metabolomics along with</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.230" end="01:01:36.610" style="s2">actual clinical Diagnostics to start</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.630" end="01:01:38.350" style="s2">looking for correlation to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.610" end="01:01:41.260" style="s2">then train the software system on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.350" end="01:01:43.540" style="s2">interpretation of the metabolomic yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.260" end="01:01:45.190" style="s2">yeah so we just you know published some</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.540" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">research research on chronic fatigue</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.190" end="01:01:49.600" style="s2">syndrome being able to distinguish that</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:54.550" style="s2">from healthy people as well as</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.600" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">depression on on it for autoimmunity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.550" end="01:02:02.680" style="s2">toxicity that was very very exciting so</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:04.120" style="s2">metabolomics might not be a familiar</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.680" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">term for everybody here do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.120" end="01:02:07.780" style="s2">just say a little bit about what the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:10.750" style="s2">metabolism why that would be an</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.780" end="01:02:12.790" style="s2">interesting diagnostic method yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.750" end="01:02:14.470" style="s2">so metabolomics is the measure of</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.790" end="01:02:16.900" style="s2">molecules in the body that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.470" end="01:02:19.510" style="s2">way less than a thousand killer Dalton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.900" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">so enzymes way tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.510" end="01:02:28.810" style="s2">killer Dalton so in metabolomics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.390" end="01:02:30.760" style="s2">measuring amino acids organic acids like</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.810" end="01:02:34.420" style="s2">I said before minerals vitamins all</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.760" end="01:02:36.280" style="s2">these fats as well so all these um all</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.420" end="01:02:38.080" style="s2">these phytochemicals that make up the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.280" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">cells that make up the organelles</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.080" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">organelles are the little organs that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">make up the cell as well so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:47.820" style="s2">looking at what our cellular responses I</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:50.260" style="s2">was looking at the true biochemistry</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.820" end="01:02:53.080" style="s2">biochemical makeup the body what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.260" end="01:02:57.400" style="s2">interesting with metabolomics is it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.080" end="01:02:59.170" style="s2">its in real time so the expression of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.400" end="01:03:02.460" style="s2">your environment meaning your genes and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.170" end="01:03:06.849" style="s2">so it gives us true true validation on</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.460" end="01:03:09.099" style="s2">moving forward right what when we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.849" end="01:03:11.020" style="s2">start to predict the results that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.099" end="01:03:13.660" style="s2">gonna have the validation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.020" end="01:03:16.440" style="s2">looking for why it&#39;s exciting me a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.660" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">yeah and so that people understand the</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.440" end="01:03:20.619" style="s2">word I&#39;ll just say a little bit more so</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:23.020" style="s2">with metabolomics we&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.619" end="01:03:25.900" style="s2">metabolic byproducts of cells and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.020" end="01:03:27.700" style="s2">cells are taking in energy sources from</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.900" end="01:03:29.589" style="s2">carbohydrates from fat from wherever</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.700" end="01:03:31.390" style="s2">they&#39;re taking the energy and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.589" end="01:03:33.040" style="s2">they&#39;re processing that energy and doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.390" end="01:03:34.839" style="s2">all the interesting things cells do and</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.040" end="01:03:38.560" style="s2">then they&#39;re producing metabolic waste</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.839" end="01:03:40.830" style="s2">products byproducts and so that&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.560" end="01:03:43.540" style="s2">know it&#39;s twenty six hundred or so</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.830" end="01:03:47.470" style="s2">metabolites that we know of a few</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.540" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">hundred primary ones and basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.470" end="01:03:51.130" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening in the cell</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:52.540" style="s2">ends up showing up in the metabolic</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.130" end="01:03:53.619" style="s2">byproducts that are coming out of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.540" end="01:03:55.030" style="s2">cell that we can look at in the blood</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.619" end="01:03:57.400" style="s2">looking at what&#39;s happening inside the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.030" end="01:03:58.869" style="s2">cell is kind of tricky but what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.400" end="01:04:00.130" style="s2">released from the cell gives us some</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.869" end="01:04:02.500" style="s2">pretty good forensics of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.130" end="01:04:05.770" style="s2">happening in the cell and so whether the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:08.589" style="s2">cell is affected by infection or</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.770" end="01:04:09.849" style="s2">toxicity or deficiency and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.589" end="01:04:11.500" style="s2">actually happening at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.849" end="01:04:14.680" style="s2">genetic transcription not just the</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.500" end="01:04:17.410" style="s2">genome but the epigenome should all show</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.680" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">up in the metabolomics now being able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.410" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">interpret all that is the work over the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:24.790" style="s2">next few years right that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:26.500" style="s2">exciting field yeah exciting yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.790" end="01:04:28.030" style="s2">happy all their prototyping that and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.500" end="01:04:30.490" style="s2">anyone who comes</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.030" end="01:04:31.780" style="s2">- Gordon medical for their own work has</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.490" end="01:04:35.650" style="s2">the chance to actually be part of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.780" end="01:04:37.330" style="s2">research definitely cool thank you</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.650" end="01:04:39.640" style="s2">nafisa thank you so much for being here</p>
