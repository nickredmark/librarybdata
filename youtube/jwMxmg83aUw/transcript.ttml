<p begin="00:00:05.260" end="00:00:11.510" style="s2">so we are in CI is the California</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.960" end="00:00:12.920" style="s2">Institute for integral studies and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.510" end="00:00:14.269" style="s2">reason we&#39;re here is that you guys did a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.920" end="00:00:19.820" style="s2">really interesting podcast about</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.269" end="00:00:23.359" style="s2">Peterson and yeah I think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.820" end="00:00:25.909" style="s2">been looking at what Peterson in</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.359" end="00:00:27.499" style="s2">particular has got to teach the left or</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.909" end="00:00:29.569" style="s2">progressives because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.499" end="00:00:31.669" style="s2">reactivity to Peterson but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.569" end="00:00:34.310" style="s2">I think we we all share some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.669" end="00:00:36.230" style="s2">there are things that progressives need</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.310" end="00:00:37.430" style="s2">to learn from Peterson as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.230" end="00:00:39.290" style="s2">think you guys did a really good job in</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.430" end="00:00:41.930" style="s2">your podcast of trying to explain what</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.290" end="00:00:44.180" style="s2">that was yeah what do you hope to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.930" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve said yes to this interview what</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.180" end="00:00:49.730" style="s2">do you guys hope to get from it well I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:51.890" style="s2">think Jesse and I have been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.730" end="00:00:54.590" style="s2">find other friends that we can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.890" end="00:00:56.930" style="s2">about these issues who don&#39;t have a sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.590" end="00:00:58.850" style="s2">of canned response either yay or nay but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.930" end="00:01:01.489" style="s2">who were trying to hold that space of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.850" end="00:01:04.759" style="s2">inquiry and that&#39;s why we recorded our</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.489" end="00:01:07.069" style="s2">podcast a couple weeks ago because me</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.759" end="00:01:10.009" style="s2">and Jesse and our other friend Adam Adam</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.069" end="00:01:12.770" style="s2">Robert we were the three that seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.009" end="00:01:16.069" style="s2">be most interested in unpacking what</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.770" end="00:01:19.389" style="s2">Peterson has to offer and most I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.069" end="00:01:22.579" style="s2">feeling that the left needs a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.389" end="00:01:27.469" style="s2">kick in the butt to get things back on</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.579" end="00:01:29.030" style="s2">track yeah I would say when Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.469" end="00:01:31.039" style="s2">Matt invited me to do that podcast we</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.030" end="00:01:33.590" style="s2">were all someone who similar to the two</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.039" end="00:01:36.889" style="s2">of you I believe was starting to track</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.590" end="00:01:38.840" style="s2">Peterson and not just Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.889" end="00:01:40.939" style="s2">what he was saying but also the ripples</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.840" end="00:01:45.109" style="s2">he was having a culture the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.939" end="00:01:46.729" style="s2">phenomenon and explosion of attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.109" end="00:01:50.149" style="s2">that was happening around him in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.729" end="00:01:51.740" style="s2">media and started kind of watching him</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.149" end="00:01:53.240" style="s2">reading him with an open mind my</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.740" end="00:01:54.439" style="s2">experience was an open mind like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.240" end="00:01:55.909" style="s2">resonate with that I love always</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.439" end="00:01:58.219" style="s2">bringing in Carl Jung and Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.909" end="00:02:00.109" style="s2">Campbell and archetypal dimensions to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.219" end="00:02:01.399" style="s2">his thinking like how he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.109" end="00:02:02.979" style="s2">kicking the left a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.399" end="00:02:06.590" style="s2">calling them on some of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.979" end="00:02:09.140" style="s2">problematic thinking and then watching</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.590" end="00:02:11.270" style="s2">this kind of phenomenon from the left or</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.140" end="00:02:14.150" style="s2">the far left where people just with</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.270" end="00:02:18.890" style="s2">extraordinary levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.150" end="00:02:22.489" style="s2">anger and fear and distrust and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.890" end="00:02:24.650" style="s2">the the difference in that experience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.489" end="00:02:25.790" style="s2">my own and some of our experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.650" end="00:02:28.340" style="s2">Peterson and then watching a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.790" end="00:02:30.680" style="s2">friends who are on the far left</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.340" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">having radically different experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.680" end="00:02:34.189" style="s2">and perception of who he is and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:36.890" style="s2">he&#39;s bringing and was really just</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.189" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">curious about that and it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.890" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">similar to some of the stuff you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">doing with rebel wisdom as a I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:46.670" style="s2">training is a psychologist we do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:48.650" style="s2">of work with with psychology as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.670" end="00:02:49.819" style="s2">when there&#39;s a huge reactivity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.650" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">something there&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.819" end="00:02:52.940" style="s2">interesting going on behind it and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:55.670" style="s2">sort of makes you inquire it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.940" end="00:02:58.099" style="s2">what is what are people reacting to yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.670" end="00:03:00.439" style="s2">whether you love them or hate them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.099" end="00:03:02.420" style="s2">like equal proportion of intensity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.439" end="00:03:05.230" style="s2">whenever that&#39;s there it&#39;s what&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.420" end="00:03:07.189" style="s2">of called a complex complex is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.230" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">psychological and I think Jung would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.189" end="00:03:11.329" style="s2">it like it can be a autonomous and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:14.269" style="s2">autonomous complex is it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.329" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">the ego it&#39;s so deep-rooted and it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.269" end="00:03:18.709" style="s2">opinion it&#39;s a collective complex in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.569" style="s2">collective unconscious it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.709" end="00:03:22.099" style="s2">everyone on the right thinks everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.569" end="00:03:23.540" style="s2">the left is a Stalinist and I real</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.099" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">everyone on the right thinks everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.540" end="00:03:28.220" style="s2">everyone the left thinks everyone the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:30.260" style="s2">right is a Nazi and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.220" end="00:03:33.409" style="s2">polarization happening where people like</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.260" end="00:03:36.139" style="s2">like Peterson who are trying to carve</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.409" end="00:03:38.269" style="s2">out I would say not non-political but a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.139" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">kind of a position that&#39;s lateral to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.269" end="00:03:42.139" style="s2">politics that&#39;s more in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">psychological domain to ask people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.139" end="00:03:45.680" style="s2">look at themselves as individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:47.209" style="s2">question the extent to which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.680" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">projecting their shadow onto the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.209" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">which until we can resolve issues on</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:54.260" style="s2">that level it&#39;s gonna be very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:56.120" style="s2">to resolve these political disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.260" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the main reasons</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.120" end="00:04:00.019" style="s2">that I&#39;ve found myself so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.040" end="00:04:01.489" style="s2">what Peterson is saying he&#39;s shifting</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.019" end="00:04:04.129" style="s2">the level of the conversation or trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.489" end="00:04:06.859" style="s2">to at least yeah this is this is the key</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.129" end="00:04:09.139" style="s2">point for me this is why I made because</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.859" end="00:04:11.720" style="s2">I first found out about him in June last</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.139" end="00:04:13.699" style="s2">year and already there was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.720" end="00:04:15.019" style="s2">of pushback but I&#39;d kind of delves into</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.699" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">the maps of meaning lectures I was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.019" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">wow this is there&#39;s an epic theory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.419" end="00:04:22.070" style="s2">everything in here and I could already</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">tell that people were not seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.070" end="00:04:26.389" style="s2">because they were reacting to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">political stuff so much that I was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.389" end="00:04:28.490" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people that I whose</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.490" end="00:04:32.810" style="s2">opinions I really value and people I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">spend time with who are just completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.810" end="00:04:39.530" style="s2">blocked by the political and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:41.960" style="s2">put your your finger on it that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.530" end="00:04:45.169" style="s2">the right level to criticize him really</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.960" end="00:04:46.909" style="s2">and I I partly and we kind of also</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.169" end="00:04:48.979" style="s2">criticized him slightly it&#39;s like I wish</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.909" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">he would stay away to some degree from</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.979" end="00:04:52.159" style="s2">the political stuff because I think what</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:53.539" style="s2">he&#39;s actually offering is far deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.159" end="00:04:55.219" style="s2">than that and far more important than</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.539" end="00:04:57.259" style="s2">being seen through that political lens</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.219" end="00:04:58.849" style="s2">yeah actually what really struck me when</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.259" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2">I was listening to your podcast as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.849" end="00:05:07.250" style="s2">was I think I personally very much went</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:08.750" style="s2">the way of so I can restart that so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.250" end="00:05:11.569" style="s2">really struck me when listening to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.750" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">podcast was its kind of really genuine</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.569" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">attempt to identify the walls that have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:18.229" style="s2">been built up on the Left I kind of find</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:20.779" style="s2">a way to see from within the left how</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.229" end="00:05:22.759" style="s2">how can you kind of disintegrate those</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.779" end="00:05:25.069" style="s2">walls walk in the left own and what can</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.759" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">it learn I think I very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.069" end="00:05:29.539" style="s2">after reading Wilbur&#39;s piece Trump in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">the first truth world then he talks</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.539" end="00:05:32.539" style="s2">about there&#39;s two different options</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.960" style="s2">either the left does that and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.539" end="00:05:38.509" style="s2">owns it stuff or we move beyond to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.960" end="00:05:39.889" style="s2">something else and I was like I was like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.509" end="00:05:41.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the left can do it I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.889" end="00:05:43.099" style="s2">to move beyond and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.300" end="00:05:44.599" style="s2">refreshing to think you know I hang on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.099" end="00:05:45.770" style="s2">actually maybe there are ways so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.599" end="00:05:48.800" style="s2">kind of something I wanted to pose to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.770" end="00:05:50.539" style="s2">you guys what what do you think are some</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.800" end="00:05:53.409" style="s2">of the things that need to happen for</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.539" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">those walls to start breaking down hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.409" end="00:05:58.430" style="s2">well I mean one of my critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:00.169" style="s2">Peterson is that in a in an age when</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.430" end="00:06:05.089" style="s2">there&#39;s all this resurgent nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.169" end="00:06:07.370" style="s2">and white nationalism and the right is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.089" end="00:06:09.849" style="s2">in power in this country and in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.370" end="00:06:12.169" style="s2">why is Peterson spending so much time</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.849" end="00:06:13.789" style="s2">worrying about what the left is gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.169" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">and the authoritarianism of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.789" end="00:06:17.750" style="s2">I get that on University campuses that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:19.569" style="s2">is a problem but the universities aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.750" end="00:06:21.699" style="s2">really holding the levers of power</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.569" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">politically the universities don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.699" end="00:06:29.539" style="s2">the largest military in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:30.830" style="s2">the world Donald Trump does and so but</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.539" end="00:06:35.449" style="s2">then I started thinking more well the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:39.020" style="s2">Left lost to Donald Trump something is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.449" end="00:06:40.759" style="s2">deeply wrong if if the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.020" end="00:06:42.889" style="s2">who&#39;s supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.759" end="00:06:46.069" style="s2">representing the values of the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.889" end="00:06:48.289" style="s2">can&#39;t be a reality-tv buffoon right not</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.069" end="00:06:50.210" style="s2">that Trump is stupid he&#39;s a mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.289" end="00:06:54.110" style="s2">at the new media environment that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.210" end="00:06:56.150" style="s2">live in and so the reason that I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.110" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">the left needs to be in dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.150" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">someone like it arson is because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:04.449" style="s2">left is not owning its own shadow</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:08.599" style="s2">and the issue of identity politics is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.449" end="00:07:10.520" style="s2">one that I feel is important in some for</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.599" end="00:07:12.650" style="s2">some reasons there are oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.520" end="00:07:16.729" style="s2">populations that need their voice to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.650" end="00:07:20.210" style="s2">heard but I feel like the the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.729" end="00:07:22.039" style="s2">Party has shifted the conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.210" end="00:07:24.979" style="s2">tried to entirely in that direction and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.039" end="00:07:26.509" style="s2">left the issue of the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.979" end="00:07:29.029" style="s2">economy that we&#39;re embedded with them</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.509" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">and even Peterson will admit that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.029" end="00:07:34.669" style="s2">end of levels of inequality we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">are dangerously extreme and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.669" end="00:07:38.180" style="s2">destabilizing our society and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:40.069" style="s2">traditionally it&#39;s been the left that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.180" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">helps to figure out ways to resolve that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.069" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">and so how do we redistribute that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:50.300" style="s2">wealth in a way that&#39;s not authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:52.789" style="s2">and oppressive and top-down that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.300" end="00:07:54.770" style="s2">kind of question that I think the left</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.789" end="00:07:55.909" style="s2">needs to be asking and it probably can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.770" end="00:07:58.189" style="s2">happen within the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.909" end="00:08:01.069" style="s2">because that&#39;s it&#39;s a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.189" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">corporately owned party the Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.069" end="00:08:04.159" style="s2">and the Democrats in this country both</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.860" style="s2">play for the same team as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.159" end="00:08:09.139" style="s2">concerned I will say I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:10.339" style="s2">common question I get if I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.139" end="00:08:11.959" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson is from these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.339" end="00:08:14.449" style="s2">folks in the intellectual dark web is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.959" end="00:08:15.169" style="s2">people will say why all this critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.449" end="00:08:17.569" style="s2">of the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.169" end="00:08:19.309" style="s2">I can&#39;t we see this rise of fascism this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.569" end="00:08:22.819" style="s2">values of totalitarianism on the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.309" end="00:08:25.099" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really big question is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.819" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">danger and the threat from the right is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.099" end="00:08:29.539" style="s2">so immediate is it not more important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:31.939" style="s2">address that and you know critiquing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.539" end="00:08:33.889" style="s2">left could be a more long-term goal and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.939" end="00:08:36.620" style="s2">agenda but to your point I heard someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.889" end="00:08:39.589" style="s2">bring us up to Wilbur in a podcast they</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.620" end="00:08:40.789" style="s2">did recently and he was saying the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.589" end="00:08:43.880" style="s2">importance of addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.789" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">dysfunctionality of the left is that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.880" end="00:08:48.620" style="s2">need a strong healthy left to fight back</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:51.079" style="s2">against the extreme and the rising of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.620" end="00:08:53.390" style="s2">the far-right without you know with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.079" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">corrosiveness that you&#39;re seeing on both</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.390" end="00:08:56.070" style="s2">the left and the right you</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:08:57.900" style="s2">need a strong left like you said like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.070" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have Trump if there had been</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">more of a cohesive healthy you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:05.820" style="s2">democratic or left candidate and party</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:08.670" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re seeing and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.820" end="00:09:11.880" style="s2">of my struggles in my frustration is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.670" end="00:09:15.150" style="s2">knee-jerk reaction airy response to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.880" end="00:09:18.270" style="s2">Trump people can get so focused on Trump</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.150" end="00:09:20.730" style="s2">and so much emotion gets at play and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.270" end="00:09:22.020" style="s2">part of me is just constantly interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.730" end="00:09:24.510" style="s2">in bringing it back away from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.020" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">symptom and to the underlying condition</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.510" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like what was the soil from which</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.240" end="00:09:32.190" style="s2">the phenomenon of Trump you know was</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:33.750" style="s2">able to place roots and grow and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.190" end="00:09:35.160" style="s2">actualize and materialize there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.750" end="00:09:37.020" style="s2">something that was already there and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.160" end="00:09:39.570" style="s2">has something to do with this radical</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.020" end="00:09:41.160" style="s2">polarization and unless we on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.570" end="00:09:43.470" style="s2">continue to think about it and do some</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.160" end="00:09:45.630" style="s2">self reflective self inquiry about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.470" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">did this happen how can we still wrap</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.630" end="00:09:50.820" style="s2">our heads around this you know Russia</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:54.030" style="s2">collusion all that as well but like how</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.820" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">on the Left can we address our part in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.030" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">the exacerbating and accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">polarization that is quite dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:02.580" style="s2">it&#39;s what you said earlier about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:04.440" style="s2">shadow of the left I mean that was what</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.580" end="00:10:07.530" style="s2">I kind of put into the glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.440" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">matrix was and it&#39;s my firm conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.530" end="00:10:14.520" style="s2">that Trump is kind of a creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">shadow of liberalism this idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.520" end="00:10:18.650" style="s2">the inclusivity that is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:21.090" style="s2">inclusive there&#39;s very sort of subtle</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.650" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">we&#39;re completely open to everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.090" end="00:10:25.650" style="s2">everything from everywhere as long as</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:28.110" style="s2">they think like us and then this subtle</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.650" end="00:10:29.910" style="s2">judging of especially in America where</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.110" end="00:10:31.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just so polarized there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.910" end="00:10:33.570" style="s2">subtle assumption that everyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.560" end="00:10:36.120" style="s2">not on the on the coast is racist and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.570" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">bigoted and even if it&#39;s not explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.120" end="00:10:41.460" style="s2">said they pick it up you have a media</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:42.990" style="s2">and that is of all things that fueled</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.460" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">Trump it seems to me that that fueled</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.990" end="00:10:49.140" style="s2">Trump this kind of the hidden shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">liberalism judging others for not being</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.140" end="00:10:53.310" style="s2">as liberal as then it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:55.950" style="s2">subtle catch-22 tribalism in some way</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.310" end="00:10:58.140" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s dangerous if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.950" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">address it because we have in America</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.140" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">these elections and midterm elections in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:03.500" style="s2">November and then we have obviously 2020</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.890" end="00:11:05.519" style="s2">I hear more and more people saying to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.500" end="00:11:08.620" style="s2">holy</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.519" end="00:11:09.639" style="s2"> like his Trump gonna win get</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.620" end="00:11:11.589" style="s2">reelected and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.639" end="00:11:13.569" style="s2">conversation a part of me is like if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.589" end="00:11:15.069" style="s2">left doesn&#39;t get this message doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.569" end="00:11:18.089" style="s2">understand its shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.069" end="00:11:21.550" style="s2">don&#39;t worry Hillary&#39;s gonna run again</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.089" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">it&#39;ll work yeah but it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.550" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">that&#39;s where I feel it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">speak about the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">dysfunctionality as well as address</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">Trump seems to sent them even crazier</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:34.689" style="s2">now he&#39;s kind of a lightning rod for for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:36.459" style="s2">the shadow for that kind of anger and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.689" end="00:11:39.339" style="s2">just seems to be driving even further as</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.459" end="00:11:41.079" style="s2">far looking from the outside yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.339" end="00:11:43.930" style="s2">two years of Trump have been an</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.079" end="00:11:45.850" style="s2">unmitigated disaster and yet in so many</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:47.500" style="s2">ways he&#39;s just a slightly more extreme</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.850" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">version of what the American presidency</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.500" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">has been for decades militaristic you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:56.379" style="s2">know pushing other countries around not</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">caring about the poor immigration has</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.379" end="00:11:59.860" style="s2">been you know we weren&#39;t putting kids</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:03.009" style="s2">and cages suffer from their parents as</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.860" end="00:12:05.800" style="s2">much as Trump was but like isn&#39;t one kid</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.009" end="00:12:07.629" style="s2">in a cage already kind of or 15 like</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.800" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">what&#39;s the number where it becomes Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.629" end="00:12:11.019" style="s2">versus it&#39;s just something that Obama</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.329" style="s2">did and we&#39;ll give him a pass for that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.019" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2">mm-hmm so you know all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.329" end="00:12:18.519" style="s2">Trump is being blamed for are just</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:21.670" style="s2">slightly more extreme versions of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.519" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">Obama did what bush did of what Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.670" end="00:12:26.970" style="s2">did so why all of a sudden is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:29.889" style="s2">everything being blamed blamed on Trump</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.970" end="00:12:32.410" style="s2">and I will say kind of to a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.889" end="00:12:36.250" style="s2">before this war what I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.410" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">problems in today&#39;s world is a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.250" end="00:12:42.610" style="s2">capacity to think in complex ways things</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:43.569" style="s2">are so complex it&#39;s complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.610" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">right and that&#39;s why I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.569" end="00:12:47.079" style="s2">intellectual dark web is we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:51.939" style="s2">about is an important space it&#39;s a space</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.079" end="00:12:53.559" style="s2">to allow long-form conversations for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.939" end="00:12:55.630" style="s2">people to think out loud and slowly</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.559" end="00:12:57.970" style="s2">start to tease apart very complex issues</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.630" end="00:12:59.470" style="s2">and we are in dangerous territory when</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.970" end="00:13:02.649" style="s2">either on the right or the left we</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.470" end="00:13:05.139" style="s2">reduce and simplify and get polarized</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.649" end="00:13:06.990" style="s2">because we stop thinking we stop seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.139" end="00:13:09.129" style="s2">the complexity and we just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.990" end="00:13:12.730" style="s2">Republicans are this Democrats or this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.129" end="00:13:14.259" style="s2">and I think in our culture we need more</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.730" end="00:13:16.870" style="s2">spaciousness to have these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.259" end="00:13:19.230" style="s2">to think together and as you know being</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.870" end="00:13:22.410" style="s2">someone on the left firmly on the left</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.230" end="00:13:24.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s unnerving to talk about some</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.410" end="00:13:26.640" style="s2">of this and start to get react responded</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.450" end="00:13:28.470" style="s2">to reacted to as if we&#39;re being read</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.640" end="00:13:30.210" style="s2">peeled and going right which is just not</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.470" end="00:13:32.310" style="s2">happening it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.210" end="00:13:34.950" style="s2">phenomena as we&#39;re talking I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.310" end="00:13:37.320" style="s2">sitting inquiring as to whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.950" end="00:13:39.510" style="s2">such a religiosity on the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.320" end="00:13:41.490" style="s2">right to be fair and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.510" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">that&#39;s for me where the difficulty comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.490" end="00:13:44.640" style="s2">in going through the political area</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:46.440" style="s2">because as soon as you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.640" end="00:13:48.120" style="s2">political realm you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.440" end="00:13:50.580" style="s2">polarization almost by definition and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.120" end="00:13:52.020" style="s2">it&#39;s stuck there and I also find when I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.580" end="00:13:53.640" style="s2">have these conversations online with</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.020" end="00:13:55.380" style="s2">people they go very differently than</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.640" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">they do in person yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.380" end="00:14:00.150" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s for me is is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">important things about moving beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.150" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">ideas realm into the embodied human</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:07.260" style="s2">realm because effectively that gives the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:09.180" style="s2">opportunity for people to meet as humans</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.260" end="00:14:11.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve had some vicious horrible</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:13.320" style="s2">conversations online with people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.130" end="00:14:14.850" style="s2">just seem to build on themselves and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:18.150" style="s2">meet those same people in real life and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.850" end="00:14:19.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like hey man I&#39;m sorry let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.150" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.260" end="00:14:23.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s true I&#39;ve experienced that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:25.980" style="s2">having sharing meals with conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.970" end="00:14:27.780" style="s2">and like maybe initially we&#39;re like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.980" end="00:14:30.540" style="s2">you believe that and like evolution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.780" end="00:14:32.100" style="s2">not a thing like and then after a few</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.540" end="00:14:35.510" style="s2">minutes because we&#39;re there with each</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.100" end="00:14:39.150" style="s2">other in person and we we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.510" end="00:14:41.730" style="s2">dehumanize one another we discover our</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.150" end="00:14:44.850" style="s2">humanity and our points of convergence</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.730" end="00:14:47.190" style="s2">and really I don&#39;t think the vast</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.850" end="00:14:48.690" style="s2">majority of of Americans I can&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.190" end="00:14:51.090" style="s2">for the UK I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.690" end="00:14:53.520" style="s2">society as well but the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.090" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">Americans across the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.520" end="00:14:57.450" style="s2">if they could sit down and break bread</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.190" style="s2">together and just talk to one another as</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.450" end="00:15:00.180" style="s2">human beings would discover how much</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.190" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">they have in common</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.180" end="00:15:05.820" style="s2">I&#39;d also say that I mean I grew up on</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:08.640" style="s2">the left I grew up my parents went to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.820" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">CND marches and sandy was campaign for</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.640" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">nuclear disarmament in the UK and so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.920" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">be part of the Labour Party and I know</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:19.950" style="s2">this for myself that on the Left we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">this sort of sense of judging people by</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.950" end="00:15:25.770" style="s2">their views and it feels like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.510" style="s2">sure that the same thing is true on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.770" end="00:15:30.570" style="s2">right I mean you see quite a few people</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.510" end="00:15:32.490" style="s2">commenting I&#39;m far more concerned like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.570" end="00:15:33.150" style="s2">have a mix of left and right views and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.490" end="00:15:34.470" style="s2">I&#39;m far more kin</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.150" end="00:15:36.390" style="s2">turned about talking about my right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.470" end="00:15:37.740" style="s2">views with left-wing people than I am my</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.390" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">left-wing views with right when people</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.740" end="00:15:44.730" style="s2">and there is a sense of the left kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.740" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">I think either Brett or Eric talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.730" end="00:15:49.110" style="s2">about this that who did you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:52.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of sense of don&#39;t talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.110" end="00:15:52.760" style="s2">someone over there you&#39;ll get cooties</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:58.980" style="s2">the left that&#39;s insulated and you said</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.790" end="00:16:01.530" style="s2">religious there is a religiosity of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.980" end="00:16:05.760" style="s2">left that I&#39;m not sure you see quite as</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.530" end="00:16:06.690" style="s2">much on the right I I think pretty to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.760" end="00:16:07.770" style="s2">honest but a lot of people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.690" end="00:16:09.720" style="s2">I&#39;m more used to having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.770" end="00:16:11.070" style="s2">with people outside their bubble whereas</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.720" end="00:16:12.870" style="s2">a lot of people on the Left managed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.070" end="00:16:15.690" style="s2">exist within that bubble I think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.870" end="00:16:16.650" style="s2">political psychologist Jonathan Hite who</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.690" end="00:16:18.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve been really enjoying you wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.650" end="00:16:20.340" style="s2">book called the righteous mind why and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.630" end="00:16:22.770" style="s2">how good people are divided by politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.340" end="00:16:24.570" style="s2">and religion but something he said is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.770" end="00:16:27.300" style="s2">that at least in America and again I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.570" end="00:16:29.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know the UK as well but most you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.300" end="00:16:31.380" style="s2">know there&#39;s a strong liberal bent for</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.880" end="00:16:33.330" style="s2">the higher education systems and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.380" end="00:16:35.160" style="s2">universities so if you&#39;re raised in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.330" end="00:16:36.330" style="s2">liberal environment you learn from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.160" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">liberal viewpoint then you go to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.330" end="00:16:40.980" style="s2">university you learn from more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:42.390" style="s2">professors and teachers and then you go</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.980" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">on this is what happened to me and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.390" end="00:16:45.510" style="s2">of my friends so we actually never</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:47.940" style="s2">learned we never really read</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.510" end="00:16:50.370" style="s2">conservative thinkers or philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.940" end="00:16:52.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t get the like the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.370" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">conservative viewpoints while</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.590" end="00:16:55.470" style="s2">conservatives you know they would learn</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">from conservative thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.470" end="00:16:58.620" style="s2">philosophers or whatnot and then they</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:00.270" style="s2">would go to university or school and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.620" end="00:17:02.280" style="s2">they would get exposed to more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.270" end="00:17:05.070" style="s2">perspectives so there&#39;s an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.280" end="00:17:06.780" style="s2">actually conservatives understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.070" end="00:17:08.280" style="s2">liberals better than liberals understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.780" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">conservatives and that kind of speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.280" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">some of the advantages that they have in</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:15.150" style="s2">interaction and some of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:16.950" style="s2">close-minded more echo-chamber on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.150" end="00:17:18.690" style="s2">left and you can see it with Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.950" end="00:17:21.300" style="s2">how Trump got elected and how wrong we</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.690" end="00:17:24.870" style="s2">got that on the left just a radical</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.300" end="00:17:27.150" style="s2">disconnect from and I think that should</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.870" end="00:17:29.400" style="s2">be a signal to those on the left that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.150" end="00:17:32.130" style="s2">got we were like our maps were way off</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.400" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">like the water we swim in it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.130" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">is because as you were saying before why</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">are we concentrating on the left or whys</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:38.790" style="s2">Peterson concentrating on the left when</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">actually the right have the power and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.790" end="00:17:43.170" style="s2">think my answer to that is that most of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:45.450" style="s2">us on the Left do not realize the extent</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.170" end="00:17:45.800" style="s2">to which we have created the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.450" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.800" end="00:17:49.970" style="s2">and actually the pathology of the left</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:52.790" style="s2">is now generally the pathology of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.970" end="00:17:53.960" style="s2">culture and so and I think the response</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.790" end="00:17:57.080" style="s2">of the right the authorized of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.960" end="00:17:58.600" style="s2">authoritarianism is mostly a response to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.080" end="00:18:00.710" style="s2">the corruption of that leftist</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.600" end="00:18:02.180" style="s2">environment and it&#39;s very difficult if</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.710" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">you grow up on the Left where you kind</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.340" end="00:18:08.410" style="s2">that has all the power and that there</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.020" end="00:18:10.340" style="s2">that you&#39;re kind of the underdogs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.410" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">realize that actually no you&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.340" end="00:18:13.910" style="s2">underdogs anymore control Hollywood you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">control most of the media control yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:17.660" style="s2">which green I would say the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:19.910" style="s2">went from being the underdogs to being</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.660" end="00:18:22.310" style="s2">the mainstream not the counterculture</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.910" end="00:18:23.390" style="s2">anymore but the main culture a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.310" end="00:18:25.430" style="s2">people are resistant to that because</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.390" end="00:18:26.900" style="s2">they&#39;re like no no we&#39;re still we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.430" end="00:18:28.670" style="s2">still fighting there&#39;s still homophobia</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.900" end="00:18:30.110" style="s2">the still racism but still we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.670" end="00:18:32.150" style="s2">the underdogs fighting against this</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.110" end="00:18:34.100" style="s2">oppressive system and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.150" end="00:18:36.680" style="s2">desire to find more and more oppression</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.100" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">even when maybe maybe it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.680" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s two different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:43.610" style="s2">power culturally the left has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:45.800" style="s2">dominant for decades but right at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.610" end="00:18:48.050" style="s2">same time that that ascendancy happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.800" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">for the left in the cultural domain</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.050" end="00:18:52.790" style="s2">they&#39;re conservatives really took over</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:54.920" style="s2">politics to the extents of you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.790" end="00:18:57.050" style="s2">Reagan and Thatcher in the 80s and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.920" end="00:18:58.370" style="s2">was so bad that like Bill Clinton was</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.050" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">running as a Democrat and then that use</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.370" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">but he was actually more of a Republican</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:06.610" style="s2">so the Democratic Party has shifted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">the right in the last few decades so</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.610" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">politically the Conservatives have</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:14.300" style="s2">consolidated power at the federal level</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:15.860" style="s2">but locally in local politics and state</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.300" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">politics the Democrats have been losing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:20.510" style="s2">elections left and right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">situation is way worse at these more</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.510" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">local levels of government than it is in</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:26.540" style="s2">the federal government even right now so</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah culturally the left has</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.540" end="00:19:30.740" style="s2">been ascendant but with mass media and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.450" style="s2">now with this new media landscape over</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.740" end="00:19:35.270" style="s2">the last I don&#39;t know when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.450" end="00:19:37.580" style="s2">market Trump is the first president to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.270" end="00:19:39.020" style="s2">win because of his because of Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.580" end="00:19:40.760" style="s2">because of social media he doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.020" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">to go through those old channels that</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.760" end="00:19:45.380" style="s2">frame who he is in a certain way and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:47.750" style="s2">what was it the day before the election</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.380" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">I think the New York Times the paper of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.750" end="00:19:53.030" style="s2">record at least until a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:57.140" style="s2">was saying that Hillary had a 90% chance</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.030" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2">of winning yeah most of them had 85% 90%</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.140" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">for why</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:03.900" style="s2">the disconnect has become yeah but in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:06.270" style="s2">this new media environment the left it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.900" end="00:20:08.370" style="s2">a level playing field now but it but</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.270" end="00:20:09.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting about you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.370" end="00:20:10.919" style="s2">know while we&#39;re still thinking we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.720" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">the underdogs we have to fight against</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.919" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">homophobia and oppression there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:19.740" style="s2">much why patriarchy at play which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2">true you have a lot of other people</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.740" end="00:20:24.299" style="s2">thinking the same thing like now the you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">know the ruling power is this liberal</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.299" end="00:20:27.960" style="s2">bent of rooting out oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:30.090" style="s2">identity politics so we have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.960" end="00:20:31.830" style="s2">that massive wave with our underdog</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.090" end="00:20:34.230" style="s2">attitude and I was having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.830" end="00:20:36.270" style="s2">with a couple friends over the 4th of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.230" end="00:20:37.830" style="s2">July I was on the East Coast for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.270" end="00:20:39.419" style="s2">wedding with some family and some</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.830" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">friends and we&#39;re talking about 4th of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.419" end="00:20:41.880" style="s2">July and my friend was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:43.500" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy looking on Instagram Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.880" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing and this is in the United</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.500" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">States obviously they&#39;re saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:49.260" style="s2">seeing friends at attention you see our</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.789" style="s2">friends some of them are just posting</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.260" end="00:20:53.640" style="s2">like wearing black and like totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.789" end="00:20:57.570" style="s2">boycotting 4th of July it&#39;s seen as like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.640" end="00:20:59.340" style="s2">such a Republican you know white power</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.570" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">you know unconscious privilege</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.340" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">celebration of white supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:06.870" style="s2">colonialism or something a genocide and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.789" style="s2">there&#39;s so much truth to that and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.870" end="00:21:10.890" style="s2">my friend was saying but then I&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.789" end="00:21:12.360" style="s2">other liberal friends you know post you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.890" end="00:21:14.190" style="s2">know with an American flag and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.360" end="00:21:15.419" style="s2">like this disconnect we just had this</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.190" end="00:21:17.809" style="s2">interesting conversation about how on</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.419" end="00:21:20.250" style="s2">the Left people can be so uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.809" end="00:21:22.049" style="s2">claiming any kind of patriotism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.250" end="00:21:25.559" style="s2">like we&#39;ve ceded all patriotism to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.049" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">right and we see it we&#39;re reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.559" end="00:21:30.270" style="s2">the right who are reacting to us and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">they see us is more and more ungrateful</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.270" end="00:21:34.710" style="s2">and kritis always criticizing what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.860" style="s2">good about this how that wasn&#39;t right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.710" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">then they grab more flags and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.860" end="00:21:41.460" style="s2">sing louder and then we see that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.630" end="00:21:43.380" style="s2">then it polarizes us away but I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.460" end="00:21:45.179" style="s2">of like I feel like I&#39;m nothing we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.380" end="00:21:47.010" style="s2">to reclaim and remember that just the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.179" end="00:21:48.750" style="s2">gratitude and the appreciation for this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:52.440" style="s2">country and the good things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.750" end="00:21:54.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not in any attempt to dismiss the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.440" end="00:21:54.929" style="s2">true genocide the true oppression the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.450" end="00:21:56.909" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.929" end="00:21:58.980" style="s2">patriarchy and white supremacy and race</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.909" end="00:22:01.650" style="s2">that does play into this phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.980" end="00:22:03.630" style="s2">is America but it feels like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.650" end="00:22:06.210" style="s2">we split and we give things like</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.630" end="00:22:07.860" style="s2">authority like loyalty and like sanctity</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.210" end="00:22:10.140" style="s2">which are three of the five kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.860" end="00:22:11.909" style="s2">moral taste buds as Jonathan hi talks</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.140" end="00:22:12.600" style="s2">about it and we just seed it to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.909" end="00:22:14.910" style="s2">right and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.600" end="00:22:17.250" style="s2">just stick with harm and fairness and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">equality this point you two made about</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.250" end="00:22:21.450" style="s2">the religiosity of the left yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:24.150" style="s2">right is obviously religious but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.450" end="00:22:25.260" style="s2">know they&#39;re religious the left denies</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.150" end="00:22:27.030" style="s2">that it&#39;s religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.260" end="00:22:28.470" style="s2">so it&#39;s this different animal and in</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.030" end="00:22:31.740" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s it&#39;s more sinister</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.470" end="00:22:34.470" style="s2">because there&#39;s a split where for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.740" end="00:22:36.630" style="s2">left generally people don&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:39.720" style="s2">traditional form of religious practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.630" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">or community so politics starts to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.720" end="00:22:43.980" style="s2">on that sort of religious fervor you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:47.430" style="s2">know so but it&#39;s not acknowledged as</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.980" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">such and that becomes ripe for all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.430" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">of psychological projection and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">possession states and a judgment of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:56.070" style="s2">others who don&#39;t agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:59.130" style="s2">which is a fascinating who was it that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">said if you if you get rid of God you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.130" end="00:23:02.780" style="s2">start believing in anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:05.940" style="s2">was it something G K Chesterton maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.780" end="00:23:07.860" style="s2">like the god-shaped hole that if we as</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.940" end="00:23:09.660" style="s2">soon as we get rid of religion we find</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.860" end="00:23:12.060" style="s2">something to replace it and on the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.660" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">at the moment like diversity equity all</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.060" end="00:23:15.120" style="s2">of these things which are useful values</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:16.800" style="s2">and this is this is why it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:18.660" style="s2">complicated thing to unpick it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.800" end="00:23:20.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not that those values are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.660" end="00:23:23.340" style="s2">those values are right but if you make</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.970" end="00:23:25.230" style="s2">them your lodestar if you make them</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.340" end="00:23:28.170" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of as Peterson would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.230" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">you&#39;re your ideal it leads to madness</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.170" end="00:23:34.440" style="s2">because it cannot be they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:36.840" style="s2">they&#39;re valuable things to include but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.440" end="00:23:39.720" style="s2">if you don&#39;t make your kind of your</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.200" end="00:26:04.190" style="s2">that and get kind of weirded out what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.610" end="00:26:07.970" style="s2">freaked out by it which then makes me</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.190" end="00:26:09.740" style="s2">even more intrigued but to your point I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.970" end="00:26:10.910" style="s2">and I think this is where kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:12.200" style="s2">Wilberg can come in I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.910" end="00:26:14.480" style="s2">where Peterson comes in I think this is</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.480" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">is when you have the kind of scientific</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.030" end="00:26:31.160" style="s2">whole is that when you lose a primal</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:48.239" style="s2">problems with that and post modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.820" end="00:26:52.149" style="s2">a big part of that that Peterson often</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.239" end="00:26:57.070" style="s2">rails against but you have I would agree</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.149" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">like a deeper guttural intensity with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.070" end="00:27:00.609" style="s2">which they would hold on to concepts of</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.570" end="00:27:11.109" style="s2">important it&#39;s just that when there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.830" end="00:27:45.549" style="s2">that&#39;s that thesis has now been tossed</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:48.220" style="s2">out the window and they talk about post</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.549" end="00:27:50.619" style="s2">secularity instead in the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.220" end="00:27:52.269" style="s2">departments because religion hasn&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.619" end="00:27:54.879" style="s2">away religion is a more powerful force</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.580" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">this is the message this is the right</p>

<p begin="00:30:09.669" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">complete understandings of what that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.820" end="00:30:17.500" style="s2">void looks like of what the the Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">idea the the deep archetypes the deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.500" end="00:30:23.559" style="s2">religious truths that we are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:25.179" style="s2">and and it&#39;s fascinating to see what if</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.559" end="00:30:27.309" style="s2">this conversation is just getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.179" end="00:30:28.210" style="s2">started I hope that it is I think you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.309" end="00:30:31.149" style="s2">mentioned tart</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.210" end="00:30:32.710" style="s2">Richard honest before he had the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.149" end="00:30:34.929" style="s2">impact on me I think I read passion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.710" end="00:30:37.539" style="s2">the Western mind at university and just</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.929" end="00:30:39.370" style="s2">thought wow this this guy&#39;s really laid</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.539" end="00:30:41.620" style="s2">out where we&#39;re at and where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.370" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">and I think this is a really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.620" end="00:30:46.990" style="s2">conversation to get started the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.639" style="s2">Petersons seems to be pulling out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.990" end="00:30:50.710" style="s2">he&#39;s in debates with Sam Harris at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.639" end="00:30:52.269" style="s2">moment and Sam Harris is kind of like if</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.710" end="00:30:54.730" style="s2">you want to say avatar he&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.269" end="00:30:57.010" style="s2">avatar for this materialist secular</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.730" end="00:30:59.350" style="s2">worldview and Peterson is the avatar for</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.010" end="00:31:01.899" style="s2">this new a real rising religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.350" end="00:31:04.539" style="s2">worldview or spiritual worldview so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.899" end="00:31:04.890" style="s2">a really fascinating discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.539" end="00:31:07.260" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.890" end="00:31:09.810" style="s2">that concept right of the the pre trans</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.260" end="00:31:10.890" style="s2">fallacy so the idea that someone you</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.810" end="00:31:12.660" style="s2">could have one person over here talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.890" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">about let&#39;s say Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.660" end="00:31:18.030" style="s2">religion and they could be very dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:19.770" style="s2">and fundamentalist in their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.030" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">they could be very you know missing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.770" end="00:31:22.680" style="s2">whole lot and some would say okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.210" style="s2">going to dismiss them then you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.680" end="00:31:25.740" style="s2">another person over here maybe more akin</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.210" end="00:31:27.540" style="s2">to Peterson who&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.740" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">Christianity religion the Christ</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.540" end="00:31:31.890" style="s2">archetype you name it but they would</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:34.230" style="s2">have moved through like integrated and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.890" end="00:31:36.660" style="s2">read and learned about science and about</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.230" end="00:31:39.060" style="s2">so many other fields and they arrived</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.660" end="00:31:41.490" style="s2">back in this place around storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.060" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">myth making and religion but from a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.490" end="00:31:45.300" style="s2">totally different place but someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:47.520" style="s2">standing over here might see them both</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.300" end="00:31:50.100" style="s2">is the same bit let&#39;s toss them both out</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.520" end="00:31:51.180" style="s2">they&#39;re both these loony primitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.100" end="00:31:54.600" style="s2">people have still connected the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.180" end="00:31:56.910" style="s2">superstitious mythological thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.600" end="00:31:59.490" style="s2">I think Peterson is really holding that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.910" end="00:32:01.410" style="s2">of like let&#39;s return to religion which</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.490" end="00:32:02.730" style="s2">you know from the Dalai Lama to call you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.410" end="00:32:04.230" style="s2">young people say you know if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.730" end="00:32:06.510" style="s2">the West you need to grapple and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:09.750" style="s2">integrate this judeo-christian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.510" end="00:32:11.910" style="s2">in paradigm and how do we reclaim that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.750" end="00:32:14.700" style="s2">but from a new level that synthesizes</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.910" end="00:32:17.040" style="s2">and integrates science and and all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.700" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">different dimensions and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.040" end="00:32:19.890" style="s2">one of the things I love about Ken</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.830" style="s2">Wilber jean gebser</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.890" end="00:32:24.990" style="s2">the Swiss cook historian cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.830" end="00:32:26.940" style="s2">historian where they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.990" end="00:32:28.470" style="s2">different stages of development and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.940" end="00:32:30.600" style="s2">evolution I know there can be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.470" end="00:32:33.660" style="s2">pushback to Wilber some of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.600" end="00:32:35.220" style="s2">integral models but that&#39;s what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.660" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">helpful for me and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.220" end="00:32:41.280" style="s2">Peterson and making sense of this moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:42.750" style="s2">is like there are truths at every stage</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.280" end="00:32:43.800" style="s2">of development and in each worldview</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.750" end="00:32:46.530" style="s2">there are different truths they might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.800" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">partial truths but anytime any stage</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.530" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">thinks they have the whole truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:52.350" style="s2">where there&#39;s a problem I think on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.380" end="00:32:53.940" style="s2">left secular liberalism can believe they</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.350" end="00:32:56.490" style="s2">have the truth because they&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.940" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">inclusivity diversity equity now at that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.490" end="00:33:02.100" style="s2">world centric pluralistic stage of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:03.660" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s its primary truth</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.100" end="00:33:06.060" style="s2">and the other stages don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.660" end="00:33:08.070" style="s2">that it&#39;s not on their radar even but</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.060" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">the second they start getting righteous</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.070" end="00:33:11.820" style="s2">and thinking everyone needs to and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:14.490" style="s2">whoever doesn&#39;t join us immediately are</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.820" end="00:33:17.220" style="s2">deplorable and racist a misogynist then</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.490" end="00:33:19.140" style="s2">they&#39;re actually like</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.220" end="00:33:21.809" style="s2">King from one level but are actually in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.140" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">a very dogmatic primal level that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.809" end="00:33:25.110" style="s2">really no different than other</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:26.549" style="s2">fundamentalists I think that&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.110" end="00:33:28.470" style="s2">key point I think it was in a recent</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.549" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">podcast with Wilbur I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.470" end="00:33:34.470" style="s2">it was a the question of are how many of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:36.390" style="s2">the people who are green in integral</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.470" end="00:33:39.390" style="s2">terms and the kind of progressive really</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.390" end="00:33:41.159" style="s2">are or are they amber or red with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.390" end="00:33:42.539" style="s2">progressive cloak on it you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.159" end="00:33:44.220" style="s2">a real interesting thing we all have all</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.539" end="00:33:46.500" style="s2">these levels within us when we get</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.220" end="00:33:47.820" style="s2">scared or maybe most days we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.500" end="00:33:49.409" style="s2">operating at green but we feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.820" end="00:33:51.150" style="s2">threatened and we regress down to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.409" end="00:33:52.710" style="s2">red or the amber you know so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:55.470" style="s2">like we&#39;re not all of the we all have</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.710" end="00:33:56.669" style="s2">all these colors within us and the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:33:58.470" style="s2">the other thing that came up when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.669" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">were speaking is just the importance</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.470" end="00:34:03.870" style="s2">again of collective shadow work an</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.700" style="s2">individual shadow work because if my</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.870" end="00:34:07.770" style="s2">background is is very much in the in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.700" end="00:34:09.929" style="s2">psychedelic community as well and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.770" end="00:34:11.369" style="s2">helped organize a conference and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.929" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">the last two conferences I&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.369" end="00:34:15.450" style="s2">variations on the same talk which called</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:18.179" style="s2">the psychedelic shadow which is hey guys</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.450" end="00:34:19.950" style="s2">we need to own our shadows because this</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.179" end="00:34:21.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t all about Jamie we&#39;ll put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.950" end="00:34:23.339" style="s2">really well there&#39;s a status in</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.240" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">catharsis and peterson is really</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.339" end="00:34:27.139" style="s2">bringing catharsis up like down from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:28.889" style="s2">depths you know and traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.139" end="00:34:30.869" style="s2">communities like the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.889" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">community and probably the new agey</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.869" end="00:34:34.830" style="s2">communities as well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.770" style="s2">progressive communities you know lots of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.830" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">them they tend to go for the ecstasy and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:43.379" style="s2">the kind of the what&#39;s the utopia what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">the perfect thing and forget the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.379" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">dark shadow work and I think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:50.460" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening with the Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:53.099" style="s2">phenomena as well is that finally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.460" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">like finally we get both and they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.099" end="00:34:56.250" style="s2">meet in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:34:58.950" style="s2">for me the whole New Age movement was</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.250" end="00:35:01.320" style="s2">one massive spiritual bypass and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.950" end="00:35:03.000" style="s2">seems like it like in any individual the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.320" end="00:35:04.710" style="s2">bypass can only go on for so long before</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.000" end="00:35:07.020" style="s2">you have to get down and dirty with your</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.710" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">shadow yeah in some sense we need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.020" end="00:35:12.180" style="s2">recover the original psychedelic mystery</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:15.240" style="s2">called the Allison Ian mysteries and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.180" end="00:35:17.070" style="s2">ancient Greece where from what we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.240" end="00:35:19.980" style="s2">tell the evidence would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.070" end="00:35:22.250" style="s2">there was a brew called the Chi kyon</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.980" end="00:35:26.099" style="s2">which was it could have been my surgical</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.250" end="00:35:28.109" style="s2">forgot fungus that&#39;s my hunch that seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.099" end="00:35:30.180" style="s2">to be the leading theory but the the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.109" end="00:35:30.930" style="s2">that they would ritually ingest this was</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.180" end="00:35:32.609" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.930" end="00:35:34.260" style="s2">reenact the myth of Persephone and go</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.609" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">into the underworld and experience that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.260" end="00:35:40.250" style="s2">cathartic death rebirth experience it</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:43.010" style="s2">wasn&#39;t this escapism that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.250" end="00:35:45.390" style="s2">psychedelic culture can now tend towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.010" end="00:35:47.849" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have a ritual container</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.390" end="00:35:50.280" style="s2">that&#39;s culturally sanctioned when elders</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.849" end="00:35:52.589" style="s2">were initiated and using it exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.280" end="00:35:54.359" style="s2">so my hope is that I feel like</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.670" end="00:37:22.530" style="s2">secrecy and there&#39;s something ritually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.579" end="00:37:24.569" style="s2">very powerful about that especially the</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.030" end="00:39:02.680" style="s2">Peterson the glitch in the matrix is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.280" end="00:39:04.599" style="s2">when you hear the term masculinity the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.680" end="00:39:07.510" style="s2">first thing you think of is toxicity we</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.880" end="00:41:46.010" style="s2">well my kid would never go to university</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:48.210" style="s2">universities not for the likes of us and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.010" end="00:41:49.620" style="s2">realizing that wow this is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.210" end="00:41:51.480" style="s2">difficult because people actually then</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.620" end="00:41:53.070" style="s2">buy into their own narrative about</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.480" end="00:41:54.600" style="s2">themselves and narrative about the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.070" end="00:41:57.990" style="s2">the world is and she found that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.600" end="00:42:00.510" style="s2">incredibly difficult to deal with but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.990" end="00:42:02.430" style="s2">but it kind of I mean she&#39;s she&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.510" end="00:42:04.770" style="s2">very much on the left it didn&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.430" end="00:42:06.270" style="s2">radicalize her in that way but she had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.770" end="00:42:08.730" style="s2">much more nuanced understanding about</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.270" end="00:42:12.090" style="s2">what the difficulty of the situations</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.730" end="00:42:14.280" style="s2">were and I guess we we work with</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.090" end="00:42:16.140" style="s2">we&#39;d work with men&#39;s work and we work</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.280" end="00:42:17.940" style="s2">with kind of helping people shift their</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.140" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">beliefs and that seems to me the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.940" end="00:42:22.500" style="s2">thing that would work to shift some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:24.360" style="s2">these social problems is really deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.500" end="00:42:25.890" style="s2">kind of work in terms of shifting what</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.360" end="00:42:28.140" style="s2">people&#39;s expectations about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.890" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">are their beliefs about their life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.140" end="00:42:31.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a real it&#39;s much deeper than the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:32.750" style="s2">left assumed like if you give people</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.290" end="00:42:34.500" style="s2">money or you give people more</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.750" end="00:42:35.840" style="s2">opportunities then they&#39;ll take them</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.500" end="00:42:37.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like no people don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.840" end="00:42:39.690" style="s2">they would be able to take these</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.950" end="00:42:41.010" style="s2">opportunities it&#39;s so much more deep a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.690" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">lot of these situations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.010" end="00:42:50.520" style="s2">internalized oppression it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:51.870" style="s2">complex yeah yeah I mean III I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.520" end="00:42:55.080" style="s2">that&#39;s really true and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.870" end="00:42:57.810" style="s2">important to hold that piece because you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.080" end="00:42:59.490" style="s2">know patriarchy is a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.810" end="00:43:02.700" style="s2">and complex thing but it&#39;s like women</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.490" end="00:43:04.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen women they cut like patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.700" end="00:43:08.220" style="s2">is a state of mind right it&#39;s a sum on</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.860" end="00:43:09.630" style="s2">some level isn&#39;t it about a Liat radical</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.220" end="00:43:12.360" style="s2">isolation and alienation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.630" end="00:43:14.730" style="s2">disconnection and acting in violent ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.360" end="00:43:16.710" style="s2">to try and get needs met out of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.730" end="00:43:18.090" style="s2">primitive scarce I mean I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.710" end="00:43:20.100" style="s2">being loose with how I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.090" end="00:43:22.680" style="s2">it but I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ve heard women talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.100" end="00:43:24.900" style="s2">about yeah women can be patriarchal they</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.680" end="00:43:26.790" style="s2">can be extremely you know violent or</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.900" end="00:43:29.430" style="s2">aggressive with losing track of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.790" end="00:43:32.100" style="s2">other no relationality a compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.430" end="00:43:33.570" style="s2">interaction with the other in workplaces</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.100" end="00:43:35.940" style="s2">so most of their problems come from</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.570" end="00:43:37.470" style="s2">other women other women bosses and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.940" end="00:43:39.090" style="s2">think there&#39;s been surveys that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.470" end="00:43:41.670" style="s2">women would prefer to have a male Boston</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.090" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">a female boss interesting it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.670" end="00:43:45.420" style="s2">say that there hasn&#39;t been tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:47.190" style="s2">violence and I think it&#39;s important as</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.420" end="00:43:50.370" style="s2">we have these conversations I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.190" end="00:43:54.390" style="s2">to remember to read to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.370" end="00:43:56.580" style="s2">rename like the reality of men&#39;s vicious</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.390" end="00:43:58.380" style="s2">and violent oppression of women of white</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.580" end="00:44:00.630" style="s2">people&#39;s oppression of people of color</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.380" end="00:44:03.180" style="s2">the radical inequality and injustice</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.630" end="00:44:04.620" style="s2">that still exists today and any attempt</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.180" end="00:44:06.390" style="s2">on the left one of the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.620" end="00:44:08.700" style="s2">I heard Jamie wheal talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.390" end="00:44:10.290" style="s2">Peterson is like he uses these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.700" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">he calls at biological reductionism but</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.290" end="00:44:14.310" style="s2">these examples and you know the Pharaohs</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:15.930" style="s2">in Egypt there was inequality of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.310" end="00:44:18.450" style="s2">and you know there was you know in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.930" end="00:44:22.380" style="s2">nature there&#39;s inequality and so this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.450" end="00:44:24.150" style="s2">kind of quickness to call out and he do</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.380" end="00:44:25.780" style="s2">good or aspirations on the Left who are</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.150" end="00:44:28.030" style="s2">trying to level some playing</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.780" end="00:44:31.060" style="s2">and bring some equality and to just call</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.030" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">that out as you know some sliding slope</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.060" end="00:44:35.890" style="s2">to genocide too but really named that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.170" style="s2">there is incredible privilege that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.890" end="00:44:40.120" style="s2">four of us have in this room that so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.170" end="00:44:41.860" style="s2">many people do not and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.120" end="00:44:43.540" style="s2">interested in how do we learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.860" end="00:44:45.190" style="s2">that how do we address that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.540" end="00:44:46.810" style="s2">really become allies to women how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.190" end="00:44:49.740" style="s2">really become allies to people of color</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.810" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">because there is such real suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.740" end="00:44:54.430" style="s2">how do we slow down these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.930" style="s2">and tease it apart and be able to name</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.430" end="00:44:58.180" style="s2">well right now on the left this</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.930" end="00:45:00.610" style="s2">conversation is sliding into a way where</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.180" end="00:45:03.100" style="s2">I feel like as a white man I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.610" end="00:45:05.710" style="s2">completely dismissed and I&#39;m and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.100" end="00:45:07.840" style="s2">no space for my thoughts on this and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.710" end="00:45:09.640" style="s2">then it becomes you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.840" end="00:45:11.710" style="s2">perpetrated become the perpetrator or</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.640" end="00:45:13.630" style="s2">the oppressed it can be oppressor I seen</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.710" end="00:45:16.600" style="s2">as Weinstein is good on this where he</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.630" end="00:45:18.370" style="s2">talks about either there&#39;s two ways that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.600" end="00:45:21.640" style="s2">the social justice narrative plays out</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.370" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">some social social justice activists</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.640" end="00:45:25.870" style="s2">want to reverse the oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:29.530" style="s2">others want to achieve some form of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.870" end="00:45:32.650" style="s2">equality of opportunity at least and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.530" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">he&#39;s very for good reason worried about</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.650" end="00:45:35.590" style="s2">the ones who will reverse the oppression</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:38.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s easy when the mob mentality</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.590" end="00:45:40.900" style="s2">breaks out that that&#39;s just you know do</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.230" end="00:45:43.660" style="s2">you point out the enemy and they are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.900" end="00:45:45.400" style="s2">new you know go to be slaughtered you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.660" end="00:45:46.990" style="s2">know because that as you&#39;re saying if</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.400" end="00:45:49.540" style="s2">someone&#39;s saying well you cannot speak</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.990" end="00:45:52.210" style="s2">do not speak that&#39;s that&#39;s a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.540" end="00:45:54.750" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.210" end="00:45:57.790" style="s2">equality that&#39;s a reverse of this like</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.750" end="00:45:59.560" style="s2">now we&#39;re on top you&#39;re you&#39;re below and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.790" end="00:46:00.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like hang on this is surely this</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.560" end="00:46:02.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t the society we&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.940" end="00:46:04.900" style="s2">create I saw a conference I was on</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.650" end="00:46:06.220" style="s2">Facebook and a friend was there and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.900" end="00:46:07.750" style="s2">was in like Joshua Tree and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.220" end="00:46:09.880" style="s2">conference and there was all about I</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.750" end="00:46:12.610" style="s2">think gender reconciliation or women and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.880" end="00:46:14.590" style="s2">they had said in the description this</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.610" end="00:46:16.870" style="s2">will be only for women&#39;s because no man</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.590" end="00:46:19.060" style="s2">is allowed to touch the stage for like</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.870" end="00:46:21.010" style="s2">three days but men we want men there and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.060" end="00:46:22.150" style="s2">to be listening but no men are allowed</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.010" end="00:46:24.280" style="s2">to touch the stage</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.150" end="00:46:25.510" style="s2">I mean implied is because men have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.280" end="00:46:28.210" style="s2">the ones on the stage with all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.510" end="00:46:29.650" style="s2">microphones but it just it totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.210" end="00:46:32.020" style="s2">rubbed me the wrong way I&#39;m like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.650" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2">saying that feels like a total reversal</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.020" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">and obviously it doesn&#39;t feel good for</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.300" end="00:46:37.750" style="s2">women or people of color to have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:38.520" style="s2">denied access to the microphones in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.750" end="00:46:39.930" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.520" end="00:46:41.400" style="s2">but to then flip it and say we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.930" end="00:46:42.390" style="s2">want anyone to touch the stage you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.400" end="00:46:45.510" style="s2">listen to us</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.390" end="00:46:47.430" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem you wants enough for</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.510" end="00:46:49.410" style="s2">helpful yeah it&#39;s not a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.430" end="00:46:51.510" style="s2">empowered place to come from either it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.410" end="00:46:53.310" style="s2">the victim perpetrator cycle and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.510" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">also just makes me think of something I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.310" end="00:46:55.860" style="s2">learned in kindergarten which is two</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:57.870" style="s2">wrongs don&#39;t make a right and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.860" end="00:46:58.230" style="s2">very very simply boils down to something</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.870" end="00:47:02.190" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.230" end="00:47:05.490" style="s2">I just wanted to pick up on one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.190" end="00:47:09.300" style="s2">fit I felt some discomfort when you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.490" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">talking about the patriarchy as in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.300" end="00:47:12.180" style="s2">men were oppressing women through</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">history I mean we thought about this a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.180" end="00:47:15.360" style="s2">lot it&#39;s like what what is the</p>

<p begin="00:47:15.360" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">sense of us all cutting ourselves off</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.700" end="00:47:20.610" style="s2">from a sort of direct form of knowing</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.920" end="00:47:30.270" style="s2">I&#39;m not because I I think men have often</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.440" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">work there&#39;s a disposability of men like</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.380" end="00:47:41.340" style="s2">all of these things seem to be true at</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:42.780" style="s2">the same time like I don&#39;t and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.340" end="00:47:45.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a danger of it getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.780" end="00:47:47.970" style="s2">conspiracy theory version of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.030" end="00:47:51.870" style="s2">patriarchy when we just see it as as one</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.870" end="00:47:56.760" style="s2">I I think it&#39;s really interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.270" end="00:47:58.830" style="s2">why I think the term patriarchy is so</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.760" end="00:48:00.330" style="s2">difficult to kind of to use because</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.830" end="00:48:02.520" style="s2">people have different opinions always</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.330" end="00:48:05.010" style="s2">and I do think that it that it obscures</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.520" end="00:48:07.260" style="s2">the disposability of men it obscures</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.010" end="00:48:09.000" style="s2">that the fact that men pretty much self</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.260" end="00:48:10.650" style="s2">sacrificed themselves to go out and work</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.000" end="00:48:12.840" style="s2">in some pretty horrific it if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.650" end="00:48:14.550" style="s2">the patriarchy patriarchy kind of sucks</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.900" end="00:48:27.450" style="s2">it&#39;s true I appreciate that pushback I</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:30.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s for me that discomfort I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.450" end="00:48:33.000" style="s2">is trying to find this point of like</p>

<p begin="00:49:26.109" end="00:49:32.349" style="s2">before I think that the the sign of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.009" end="00:49:34.569" style="s2">mature mine is being able to hold things</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.349" end="00:49:36.729" style="s2">that are equally true but contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.569" end="00:49:38.469" style="s2">at the same time and it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.729" end="00:49:40.269" style="s2">thing to do because I think I think this</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.469" end="00:49:42.130" style="s2">may be links into the fact that we use</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.269" end="00:49:44.049" style="s2">language we assign concepts to things</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.130" end="00:49:45.910" style="s2">and we are kind of as Vic and Stein</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.809" end="00:49:56.499" style="s2">and I mean we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.499" end="00:50:03.039" style="s2">but Ralph Waldo Emerson said once</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.429" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">thinking is the hardest task in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.039" end="00:50:08.739" style="s2">world thinking is the hardest task in</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:10.599" style="s2">the world and I find whenever I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.739" end="00:50:13.929" style="s2">get emotional in a political discussion</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.599" end="00:50:18.549" style="s2">I kind of regress into an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.929" end="00:50:21.759" style="s2">complex and I speak from a position</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.549" end="00:50:23.079" style="s2">that&#39;s not really mine I&#39;m sort of it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.209" end="00:50:30.969" style="s2">thinking anymore and so as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.089" end="00:50:33.189" style="s2">might want to critique hyper rationality</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.969" end="00:50:34.989" style="s2">and materialism and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.189" end="00:50:36.699" style="s2">reductionism and everything whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.989" end="00:50:38.890" style="s2">we&#39;re moving into is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.699" end="00:50:41.019" style="s2">irrational right you know it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.890" end="00:50:43.989" style="s2">integrate the mind and the intellect and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.019" end="00:50:47.650" style="s2">everything we value in our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.989" end="00:50:50.349" style="s2">think and the intellectual darkweb so</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.650" end="00:50:53.799" style="s2">much of what it&#39;s allowing back into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.349" end="00:50:58.089" style="s2">culture is this slowing down this</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.799" end="00:50:59.739" style="s2">opening up of a space of possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.089" end="00:51:01.269" style="s2">think through the options and to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.739" end="00:51:02.380" style="s2">yeah we have values that are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.269" end="00:51:04.450" style="s2">emotionally rude</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.380" end="00:51:06.730" style="s2">that we want to protect and and speak to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.450" end="00:51:08.500" style="s2">but how do we you know we could share</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.730" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">the same values but have different ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.500" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">of operationalizing them realizing them</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:13.750" style="s2">in the world and we could learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:17.380" style="s2">from one another</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.750" end="00:51:19.390" style="s2">about how to operationalize like even if</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.380" end="00:51:21.670" style="s2">we all think the quality about of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.390" end="00:51:23.560" style="s2">opportunity is a great thing how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.670" end="00:51:25.480" style="s2">achieve that the left might have a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.560" end="00:51:27.400" style="s2">different way of doing it than the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.480" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">maybe we need to beta-test a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.400" end="00:51:31.600" style="s2">work with each other to see what works</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:33.130" style="s2">from each side and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.600" end="00:51:35.230" style="s2">assemble that into something that can</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.130" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">deal with the complexities of the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.230" end="00:51:42.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re living in hmm so yeah just a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">little plug for thinking yeah want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.940" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">bring back to something you said before</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:48.550" style="s2">about the father archetype because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:52.060" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a big picture I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.550" end="00:51:53.860" style="s2">that speaks to the charge at Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.060" end="00:51:56.050" style="s2">bringing more than anything else and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.860" end="00:51:57.190" style="s2">possibly speaks to a deeper resolution</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.050" end="00:51:59.650" style="s2">of what he&#39;s bringing as well because I</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.190" end="00:52:01.300" style="s2">think I really feel that what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.650" end="00:52:03.430" style="s2">bringing is this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.300" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">structure this father archetype but a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.430" end="00:52:08.260" style="s2">lot of the the deep history of Western</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">culture probably up until and including</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:11.890" style="s2">the 60s because Young is a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">it as well like it he&#39;s he&#39;s channeling</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.890" end="00:52:16.750" style="s2">this deep story of Western culture and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:18.520" style="s2">by definition there is a big sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.750" end="00:52:19.060" style="s2">patriarchal element to that to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.520" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.060" end="00:52:23.530" style="s2">and I think there probably is a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:25.150" style="s2">resolution of if he&#39;s if he&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.530" end="00:52:27.190" style="s2">back the divine masculine and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.150" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">have lost a lot of the divine masculine</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.190" end="00:52:32.110" style="s2">in in the last 30 years there is a sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:32.820" style="s2">of well anything goes do whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.110" end="00:52:35.200" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.820" end="00:52:36.610" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t actually speak we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:38.350" style="s2">structure we need discipline we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.610" end="00:52:40.740" style="s2">self responsibility and this is that his</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.350" end="00:52:44.020" style="s2">body&#39;s bringing back but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.740" end="00:52:45.340" style="s2">he there is probably a deeper resolution</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.020" end="00:52:47.560" style="s2">to the energy that he&#39;s bringing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.340" end="00:52:50.200" style="s2">that is the feminine as well there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.560" end="00:52:54.460" style="s2">some sort of divine feminine energy that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.200" end="00:52:55.660" style="s2">needs to be brought back and what if the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.460" end="00:52:57.730" style="s2">crisis that we&#39;re seeing at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.660" end="00:52:59.350" style="s2">is and I believe it is a kind of male</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.730" end="00:53:01.360" style="s2">crisis of having shut ourselves off from</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.790" end="00:55:25.609" style="s2">until now the last hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.970" end="00:55:28.040" style="s2">starting in the 30s I guess it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:35.360" style="s2">also be slippery and turning into that</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.750" end="00:55:37.940" style="s2">devouring mother more pathological and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.360" end="00:55:39.350" style="s2">so it&#39;s this kind of awkward thing where</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.940" end="00:55:41.330" style="s2">especially as men if we&#39;re trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.350" end="00:55:43.070" style="s2">oh now it&#39;s the devouring mother and</p>

<p begin="00:55:43.070" end="00:55:48.800" style="s2">pathological aspect there&#39;s no term of</p>

<p begin="00:55:48.800" end="00:55:51.770" style="s2">weird is it that there&#39;s toxic</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.300" end="00:55:53.900" style="s2">masculinity but there&#39;s no toxic</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.770" end="00:55:55.670" style="s2">femininity now yeah young is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.900" end="00:56:00.080" style="s2">interesting figure in this sense he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.670" end="00:56:02.210" style="s2">certainly the wise old man but all of</p>

<p begin="00:56:02.210" end="00:56:05.540" style="s2">him were women</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.140" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">you know Tony Wolfe and Marilla Levon</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.540" end="00:56:10.490" style="s2">France and so he&#39;s catalyzing this sense</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.490" end="00:56:14.150" style="s2">and the assumption of Mary was something</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.740" end="00:56:15.530" style="s2">he pointed to was that Lisa the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.150" end="00:56:17.600" style="s2">beginning of the rise of the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.530" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">and he critiqued Christianity and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.600" end="00:56:21.590" style="s2">Trinity in particular for having these</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:24.590" style="s2">three dudes at the seat of power of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.590" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">universe and he thought that 3 is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.590" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">unstable number we need the quarter</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:32.210" style="s2">natee and the fourth he identified with</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:33.710" style="s2">the feminine and that our culture is our</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.210" end="00:56:37.150" style="s2">judeo-christian culture in the West is</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.710" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">seeking some more stable psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.150" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">orientation that was the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:43.880" style="s2">function the feeling function exactly</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:45.260" style="s2">and there&#39;s one issue I want to it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.880" end="00:56:48.040" style="s2">bone I want to been wanting to pick with</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.260" end="00:56:50.360" style="s2">Peterson for a while which is this very</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.040" end="00:56:52.520" style="s2">literalist identification of in</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.360" end="00:56:57.130" style="s2">mythology of the feminine with chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.520" end="00:56:59.990" style="s2">the masculine order I&#39;m not um you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.130" end="00:57:02.480" style="s2">mythology expert or anything but if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.990" end="00:57:04.940" style="s2">think about Athena or any Queen</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.480" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">archetype these aren&#39;t chaotic goddesses</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.940" end="00:57:09.230" style="s2">and on the on the male side if you think</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:11.120" style="s2">of Dionysus</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.230" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">you mentioned the trickster like there</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.120" end="00:57:16.490" style="s2">are plenty of examples of male deities</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.860" style="s2">and female deities that break that easy</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.490" end="00:57:20.270" style="s2">identification of masculine with order</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.860" end="00:57:21.770" style="s2">and feminine with chaos just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.270" end="00:57:23.420" style="s2">point that out it&#39;s interesting about I</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.770" end="00:57:26.150" style="s2">was literally thinking about that point</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.420" end="00:57:27.740" style="s2">right before you said it and it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.150" end="00:57:29.360" style="s2">another way to see it was I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.740" end="00:57:32.270" style="s2">as soon as you said Yong Yong was a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.360" end="00:57:35.390" style="s2">fan of the Gnostics who I&#39;m a big fan of</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.270" end="00:57:38.120" style="s2">and there is in their mythos there is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.390" end="00:57:40.790" style="s2">sense of the feminine not as chaos so</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.120" end="00:57:42.410" style="s2">much as undifferentiated and then they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.790" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">have they have Sofia and Cristo</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.410" end="00:57:46.700" style="s2">and Christos the role Christos plays is</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:49.160" style="s2">similar to the role of the Green Man in</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.700" end="00:57:51.740" style="s2">Celtic mythology it&#39;s kind of puts every</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.160" end="00:57:54.740" style="s2">species in its niche and creates order</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.740" end="00:57:58.280" style="s2">in the not chaos so much as the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.740" end="00:57:59.810" style="s2">undifferentiated and that for me is part</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.280" end="00:58:02.270" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on with Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.810" end="00:58:05.570" style="s2">just with the you know the the shift</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.270" end="00:58:08.750" style="s2">away from postmodern hyper relativism is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.570" end="00:58:11.780" style="s2">that the natural response to that is to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.750" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">play some order in it and to put things</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.780" end="00:58:16.430" style="s2">in to their niches so to speak and part</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:19.310" style="s2">of that is hierarchy as part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.430" end="00:58:20.390" style="s2">breaking things down and saying okay we</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.310" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2">need to accept this and this from</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.390" end="00:58:24.590" style="s2">biology we need to look at this and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.550" end="00:58:26.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s still ongoing that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.590" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">so it is user work chaotic it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.840" end="00:58:31.030" style="s2">bit chaotic because these are very</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:35.300" style="s2">complex things and I feel like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.030" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s two things coming together but</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.300" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">hopefully it gets to somewhere where</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:41.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper resolution sacred</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.940" style="s2">marriage I mean that&#39;s how that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.540" end="00:58:46.130" style="s2">Richard harness talks about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.940" end="00:58:49.400" style="s2">epilogue the passion of the Western mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.130" end="00:58:52.610" style="s2">is that you know clearly the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.400" end="00:58:56.120" style="s2">rational consciousness has been driving</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.610" end="00:58:59.510" style="s2">the Western ego and Western culture to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.120" end="00:59:01.430" style="s2">this point and all the while alienating</p>

<p begin="00:59:03.980" end="00:59:08.900" style="s2">forward in that way for so many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.600" end="00:59:11.950" style="s2">culturally ecologically often the earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.900" end="00:59:14.150" style="s2">or Gaia&#39;s identified as the feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.950" end="00:59:16.850" style="s2">you know some feminists have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.150" end="00:59:19.660" style="s2">with that and I get that but there&#39;s a</p>
