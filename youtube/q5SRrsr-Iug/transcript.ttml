<p begin="00:00:05.359" end="00:00:12.090" style="s2">hey folks welcome to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">podcast I have with me Yuri Dagon who is</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.090" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">in Moscow he is a tech entrepreneur and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">longevity researcher who has recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">come to my attention as someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.350" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">done extensive work looking into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:32.700" style="s2">origins of the SARS Cove - pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">I was very impressed when I read his</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:36.600" style="s2">paper on medium I talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:38.660" style="s2">previously on the podcast with Heather</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:41.510" style="s2">and so many of you have seen his work</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.660" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">what you may or may not know is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.510" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">especially this week that work has shown</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">up in a number of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">publications as a a strong bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">research pointing in the direction of at</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">least not shutting down the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">origin hypothesis for the virus so Yuri</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">welcome to the podcast thank you so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">and I have talked a number of times</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:14.630" style="s2">about what this virus looks like to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">and why it is that we&#39;re having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.630" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">swallowing the official story that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">virus clearly came from nature perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">through a wet market but that it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">nothing to do with the two labs that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">study that born coronaviruses in Wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">China so what I want to do is bring the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">fans of this podcast along a bit so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:43.110" style="s2">they can get the view from somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">really does understand the biotech</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.110" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">aspect of coronavirus research and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:51.140" style="s2">can make a judgment for themselves based</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.049" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">on real information rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.140" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">dueling personalities making claims so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">hope I can fill those shoes but thanks</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">for the credit well I know you could be</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:10.649" style="s2">giving shoes I you know I think you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">don&#39;t fully believe that you are at an</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">epicenter of history but obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">pandemic is a major historical event in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">some ways it is a singular historical</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">event and your work on you know your</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">work which is you know not in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:30.810" style="s2">laboratory with coronaviruses but your</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.430" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">work revealing the patterns in that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">body of literature and what they suggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">about what is possible and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">to consider with respect to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">that work is the gold standard you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.740" style="s2">really done a better job than anybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">else surveying that literature and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.740" end="00:02:51.209" style="s2">pointing out what it implies I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">really the there&#39;s one problem with it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.209" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">it&#39;s that the work is so complex that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">had to read your your paper twice in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:03:01.050" style="s2">order to understand fully what you were</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">saying and I think for laypeople it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.050" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">out of reach until we unpack it for them</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">a bit but it really is very high quality</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:11.810" style="s2">work and you&#39;re courageous to have put</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:14.910" style="s2">it out well thank you I just you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:18.269" style="s2">disclaimer that I&#39;m not a biologist by</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.910" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">any stretch of imagination and I mean my</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.269" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">knowledge of biology is I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">just at a level where I can just see</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">genetic patterns and blast sequences and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">see differences or similarities and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:36.410" style="s2">that medium Paul&#39;s post or medium</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:38.670" style="s2">article is nowhere like it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.410" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2">scientific paper and it&#39;s not meant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.670" end="00:03:43.380" style="s2">be it&#39;s meant to be just an overview of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.170" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">the things that viruses hydrologists</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.380" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">have been doing in the kind of research</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:50.580" style="s2">they&#39;ve been doing and and just my kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">of ramblings about the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.580" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">would have thought could have pointed at</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:04:01.019" style="s2">a lab origin or natural origin and I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:03.299" style="s2">kind of sharing my my journey which took</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.019" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">me from initially being extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.299" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">skeptical about the possibility of lab</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.160" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">escape to being much less skeptical and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">actually quite upset that so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">established scientists just dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">this as a conspiracy theory which kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">of leads people like me initially who</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:25.710" style="s2">trust scientists trust their opinion to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">just by association to do the same and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.710" end="00:04:31.850" style="s2">but actually when you look at the facts</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:35.449" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we can be that you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.850" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">sure that this is not a lab leak and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.449" end="00:04:40.979" style="s2">think those are biologists who claim</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s zero chance or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.979" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">virtually no chance of this being a lab</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:52.380" style="s2">escape are to put it mildly incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:55.410" style="s2">well you know you&#39;re obviously bending</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.380" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">over backwards not to say what I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.410" end="00:05:00.930" style="s2">is clear to both of us which is we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.090" style="s2">say that this is a lab leak but we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.930" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">say anybody who tells you for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.090" end="00:05:07.349" style="s2">it isn&#39;t is either very confused about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:09.509" style="s2">the facts or not telling you what they</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.349" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">know and that that you know you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.509" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">virologist but in a sense that may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:18.330" style="s2">why you&#39;re able to play the role that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:20.580" style="s2">you&#39;re playing something about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.330" end="00:05:23.130" style="s2">incentives that surround mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.580" end="00:05:28.710" style="s2">viral adji at the moment has caused the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.130" end="00:05:31.289" style="s2">entire field to line up behind a story</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.710" end="00:05:35.599" style="s2">that is incorrect that lab leak is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.289" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">worth considering as a hypothesis and as</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.599" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve pointed out on the podcast before</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.030" end="00:05:42.900" style="s2">that puts us in a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">situation because at the moment when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.900" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">have a global pandemic unfolding with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:51.419" style="s2">bat derived coronavirus the very people</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.699" style="s2">who need to be at the forefront of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.419" end="00:05:57.860" style="s2">helping us understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.699" end="00:06:01.349" style="s2">what that implies about the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.860" end="00:06:03.389" style="s2">mechanisms at work in this virus those</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.349" end="00:06:07.259" style="s2">people have all compromised themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.389" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">by telling us a fairy tale so what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.259" end="00:06:14.280" style="s2">like to do is unpack a little bit what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:17.970" style="s2">the evidence does look like and what</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.280" end="00:06:22.620" style="s2">what it doesn&#39;t yet tell us so can you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.970" end="00:06:24.900" style="s2">outline what the the facts are that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.620" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">most striking to you with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.900" end="00:06:30.530" style="s2">unpacking the or with respect to sorting</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">out what the most likely explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.530" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">sure well I mean the biggest coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:39.389" style="s2">would be the striking thing is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:43.110" style="s2">happening in who had</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.389" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">which is you know that next door to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.110" end="00:06:48.569" style="s2">lab that is like the number one lab in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:50.219" style="s2">China on coronaviruses and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.569" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">listen himself is a huge coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.219" end="00:06:56.460" style="s2">this that hasn&#39;t been explained at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:06:58.860" style="s2">at this point and which has puzzled many</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.460" end="00:07:01.830" style="s2">scientists including she generally the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.860" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">the the chief scientist in Colonel</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.830" end="00:07:07.050" style="s2">biology she&#39;s not the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">Institute but she&#39;s like a probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.050" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">number one leading scientists or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">most recognized name in corona biology</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:18.300" style="s2">in China and she herself was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">the number one person suspecting a lab</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.300" end="00:07:25.469" style="s2">leak out of her lab because when is is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:27.800" style="s2">very odd place for a chronic virus leak</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.469" end="00:07:32.610" style="s2">to occur from like a bat coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.800" end="00:07:37.050" style="s2">because well first of all they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.610" end="00:07:38.909" style="s2">really eat bats in in wahdahu Bay as</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.050" end="00:07:41.400" style="s2">opposed to like in the south of China</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.909" end="00:07:43.889" style="s2">where actually like one dawn where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.400" end="00:07:45.690" style="s2">it is part of the cuisine and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.889" end="00:07:47.819" style="s2">know all this like to me like when</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.690" end="00:07:50.039" style="s2">people were initially saying that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.819" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">is odd I thought well come on it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.039" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">wet market yeah it&#39;s like maybe a small</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:57.539" style="s2">chance of happening but I&#39;m sure they</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">have bats there but when I actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.539" end="00:08:05.460" style="s2">looked at the evidence but before I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:07.409" style="s2">became skeptical of the impossibility of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.460" end="00:08:09.839" style="s2">the lab leak I thought that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.409" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not a not a big coincidence but</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.839" end="00:08:14.129" style="s2">after looking at it I realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:16.229" style="s2">is a huge coincidence because and those</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.129" end="00:08:18.629" style="s2">bats that carry those kernel viruses</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.229" end="00:08:21.620" style="s2">they don&#39;t live in nowhere near when</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.629" end="00:08:26.219" style="s2">they live you know 2,000 kilometers away</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.620" end="00:08:28.860" style="s2">in Yunnan and any other outbreaks of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.219" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">kernel viruses that like SARS or HK you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.860" end="00:08:34.519" style="s2">want that happened that happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:37.829" style="s2">I guess the tropical climate snake so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.519" end="00:08:39.990" style="s2">and one is just very very odd place for</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.829" end="00:08:42.329" style="s2">this to have occurred it&#39;s an odd place</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.990" end="00:08:45.390" style="s2">it&#39;s also an odd time since those bats</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.329" end="00:08:47.220" style="s2">would have been hibernating absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.390" end="00:08:50.310" style="s2">too conspicuous facts that suggest</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:52.980" style="s2">something about the Wuhan origin is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.310" end="00:08:55.769" style="s2">odd right and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.980" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">have any any other explanation like</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.769" end="00:09:00.420" style="s2">natural origin explanation of how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:04.290" style="s2">virus could have gotten there like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.420" end="00:09:07.010" style="s2">scat scared the wet market and now even</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.290" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">beneficial Chinese sources dismiss this</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.010" end="00:09:11.510" style="s2">hypothesis that no actually wet market</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.459" style="s2">is not the place of origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.510" end="00:09:17.160" style="s2">epidemic and so it&#39;s just a huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.459" end="00:09:20.760" style="s2">question mark which isn&#39;t in any way</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.160" end="00:09:23.579" style="s2">explained at this point and and lab Lee</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.760" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">explains perfectly you know yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.579" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">think it would be worth pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">that you and I had a parallel journey in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:35.490" style="s2">this regard you were initially</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">researching to basically to buttress</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.490" end="00:09:41.670" style="s2">your argument that the lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:43.980" style="s2">hypothesis was an empty one and as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.670" end="00:09:46.949" style="s2">delved you discovered that it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.980" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">empty hypothesis at all for my part I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.949" end="00:09:51.269" style="s2">was in the Amazon with Heather</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:54.570" style="s2">completely out of contact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.269" end="00:09:56.899" style="s2">and we emerged from a very remote</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.570" end="00:10:01.800" style="s2">location the tipitina Biological Station</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.899" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">into into we came out and went into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.800" end="00:10:05.910" style="s2">Andes for a couple days and we started</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:08.579" style="s2">to look at what was on the internet that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.910" end="00:10:10.680" style="s2">we had missed and there was a story</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.579" end="00:10:12.660" style="s2">about this corona virus circulating and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.680" end="00:10:18.600" style="s2">you know this was very early this was in</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.660" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">in February and I looked at it and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.600" end="00:10:23.910" style="s2">bat biologist and I saw okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:25.800" style="s2">wet market people are eating bats this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.910" end="00:10:28.050" style="s2">is a bat born corona virus the story</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.800" end="00:10:30.149" style="s2">looked very straightforward to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.050" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">I tweeted about it and I said you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.149" end="00:10:35.579" style="s2">haven&#39;t done a thorough look but what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:38.850" style="s2">understand from the evidence here this</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.579" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">does look like a virus that would have</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.850" end="00:10:43.800" style="s2">been in horseshoe bats and that it would</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">have emerged through contact and I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.800" end="00:10:48.089" style="s2">something about wet markets being</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:50.279" style="s2">dangerous I think and I immediately got</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.089" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">back a number of replies that said so</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.279" end="00:10:54.600" style="s2">you think it&#39;s a coincidence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:58.529" style="s2">in the same location as this you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.600" end="00:11:00.180" style="s2">biosafety lab level four that studies</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.529" end="00:11:03.569" style="s2">bat coronaviruses and I immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.180" end="00:11:05.310" style="s2">retracted my tweet and I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.569" end="00:11:06.300" style="s2">obviously something about this story I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.310" end="00:11:09.270" style="s2">don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.300" end="00:11:13.500" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s a huge coincidence and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.270" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">know I initially thought maybe the facts</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.500" end="00:11:17.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t turn out to be what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.070" style="s2">they were they would turn out you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.220" end="00:11:21.510" style="s2">as you wondered maybe these labs that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.070" end="00:11:23.370" style="s2">study these viruses are really very</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.510" end="00:11:24.840" style="s2">common and so it showing up in wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:27.980" style="s2">isn&#39;t that special because if there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.840" end="00:11:29.910" style="s2">a thousand such labs or whatever then ok</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.980" end="00:11:31.950" style="s2">emergen you&#39;re one of them but no this</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.910" end="00:11:34.710" style="s2">is one of the two most important labs in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.950" end="00:11:37.320" style="s2">the world that studies these viruses so</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.710" end="00:11:39.960" style="s2">anyway that that moment of waking up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.320" end="00:11:44.130" style="s2">these coincidences are too big to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.960" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">then leads you into the biology and kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.130" end="00:11:49.140" style="s2">of one of the contrary points that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:51.450" style="s2">being made initially was that well of</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.140" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">course they had the lab where the bats</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.450" end="00:11:56.310" style="s2">are so but then you actually examined</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.140" style="s2">and realized no those bats don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.310" end="00:12:00.660" style="s2">anywhere near the lab they live</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.140" end="00:12:03.960" style="s2">thousands of kilometers away and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.660" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">that that alone was enough to make you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.960" end="00:12:08.790" style="s2">almost scratch your head and think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:11.250" style="s2">you know this is all to the story that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.790" end="00:12:15.150" style="s2">people like virologists make it out to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.250" end="00:12:18.510" style="s2">be so yeah a lot of questions that kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.150" end="00:12:20.520" style="s2">of led me down the rabbit hole and after</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.510" end="00:12:23.190" style="s2">looking at the kind of research that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.520" end="00:12:23.960" style="s2">been going on in that lab and around the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.190" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.960" end="00:12:31.860" style="s2">the lab leak hypothesis has become much</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:34.380" style="s2">more probable than initially yeah the I</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.860" end="00:12:36.300" style="s2">think the frightening thing to me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.380" end="00:12:40.440" style="s2">the most frightening thing here is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.300" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">if you have the background that allows</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.440" end="00:12:45.330" style="s2">you to just even begin to look into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:45.990" style="s2">facts here and you don&#39;t have a dog in</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.330" end="00:12:48.210" style="s2">the fight</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.990" end="00:12:49.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not a virologist right or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.210" end="00:12:52.170" style="s2">not signed up with a political team</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.500" end="00:12:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s selling a particular story then</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.170" end="00:12:58.710" style="s2">you instantly end up in this rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.470" end="00:13:00.390" style="s2">where all of the things that you&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.710" end="00:13:03.210" style="s2">about why you shouldn&#39;t pay any</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.390" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2">attention to that hypothesis turn out to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.210" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">be paper-thin and then all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:11.070" style="s2">that might point in the direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:12.840" style="s2">lab turn out to be harder to dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.070" end="00:13:15.840" style="s2">and then you would like them to be and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.840" end="00:13:19.560" style="s2">so at the point you start talking to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.840" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">people about this you discover</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.560" end="00:13:25.710" style="s2">that the resistance to this idea is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:27.840" style="s2">based in facts or logic it is based in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.710" end="00:13:31.230" style="s2">something else but it is very strong so</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.840" end="00:13:32.700" style="s2">have you encountered this I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.230" end="00:13:35.100" style="s2">if I said at the top you&#39;re in Moscow</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.700" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in Moscow for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.100" end="00:13:39.960" style="s2">duration of the pandemic yeah I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">got stuck in Moscow</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.960" end="00:13:43.050" style="s2">once the Flies got cancelled and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.510" style="s2">borders closed</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.050" end="00:13:47.490" style="s2">I&#39;m sure yeah absolutely I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.510" end="00:13:50.120" style="s2">encountered it and actually I was bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.490" end="00:13:53.670" style="s2">surprised that the strongest opposition</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.120" end="00:13:55.650" style="s2">to the idea that lab leak is possible I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.670" end="00:13:59.970" style="s2">got from the Russian scientific</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.650" end="00:14:02.220" style="s2">community and people who also supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.970" end="00:14:05.490" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t have any dogs in</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.220" end="00:14:09.270" style="s2">this fight either but to them the very</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.490" end="00:14:11.910" style="s2">kind of thought of even considering that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.270" end="00:14:14.700" style="s2">the scientists could be lying to them</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.910" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">that was blasphemy and they you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.700" end="00:14:19.650" style="s2">very harsh and the criticism that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:24.030" style="s2">just gonna pet Lincoln&#39;s baseless</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.650" end="00:14:27.300" style="s2">conspiracy theories but when actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.030" end="00:14:29.700" style="s2">pressed for kind of a logical</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.300" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">explanation why they think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.700" end="00:14:34.140" style="s2">volcano dismissal a hypothesis why do</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.010" end="00:14:38.310" style="s2">they believe so strongly that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.140" end="00:14:40.080" style="s2">it&#39;s cannot possibly be a lab leak they</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.310" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">don&#39;t really have any evidence or at</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:54.210" style="s2">they only sequenced a very short</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.560" end="00:21:25.230" style="s2">in mainland China so the odds of having</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.630" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">bat strain in 2013 it was so</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:49.420" style="s2">uninteresting to them that they just put</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:52.180" style="s2">it in the freezer and never touched it</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.420" end="00:22:54.670" style="s2">until in 2020 just by sheer luck</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.180" end="00:22:56.470" style="s2">they sequence stars - and and saw a</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.680" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">becomes hard to believe you know I mean</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:11.620" style="s2">not add up the fact is right you have a</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.620" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">studying SARS like coronaviruses they</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.870" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">in the pandemic sequence yeah and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.920" end="00:23:30.280" style="s2">got these reactive antibodies so this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:32.530" style="s2">what they&#39;re looking for and their story</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.280" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">that they at the time regarded it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.530" end="00:23:37.060" style="s2">unimportant just simply holds no water I</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">would point out that there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.060" end="00:23:41.890" style="s2">important piece of information here for</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.260" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">from the consensus perspective one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.930" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">the things that is maximally conspicuous</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:24:00.040" style="s2">to me is the virus that emerges in wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:24:02.530" style="s2">is ready to go right it is it is adapted</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.040" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">to human beings there is no evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.530" end="00:24:07.150" style="s2">a phase in which it is fumbling about</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:08.860" style="s2">trying to discover the means to infect</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.150" end="00:24:11.500" style="s2">human cells well enough to become</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.860" end="00:24:15.580" style="s2">spreadable right no evidence of that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.500" end="00:24:19.810" style="s2">hits the ground and boom now the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.580" end="00:24:24.100" style="s2">from 2012-2013 in this cave this mine in</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.810" end="00:24:26.290" style="s2">Yunnan is indicative of something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.100" end="00:24:28.840" style="s2">must be true which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.290" end="00:24:31.810" style="s2">actually little jumps into human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.840" end="00:24:34.980" style="s2">are not that uncommon in general no</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.810" end="00:24:37.480" style="s2">pandemic arises because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.980" end="00:24:38.920" style="s2">experiment successfully the viruses</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.480" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">don&#39;t experiment successfully and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.920" end="00:24:43.420" style="s2">discover the key to infecting large</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">numbers of humans so people may get sick</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:49.330" style="s2">they get better but the world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.010" end="00:24:50.740" style="s2">end up knowing about these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.330" end="00:24:52.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s a tiny outbreak of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.740" end="00:24:57.670" style="s2">pneumonias and they&#39;re a pneumonias all</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.540" end="00:25:00.790" style="s2">the time so the fact of the virus in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.670" end="00:25:02.380" style="s2">wuhan being so well adapted the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.790" end="00:25:04.420" style="s2">that we have evidence that viruses that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.380" end="00:25:05.830" style="s2">are not especially well adapted do jump</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.420" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">sometimes and it doesn&#39;t turn into</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.830" end="00:25:10.890" style="s2">something that we notice at a historical</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:13.410" style="s2">level these two things are really</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.890" end="00:25:16.690" style="s2">important and then you have a laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.410" end="00:25:18.760" style="s2">behaving oddly with respect to the exact</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.690" end="00:25:20.200" style="s2">thing that they claim to be looking for</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.760" end="00:25:21.370" style="s2">we know they were looking for it we know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.200" end="00:25:23.680" style="s2">that they were working on these things</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.370" end="00:25:27.250" style="s2">and so now I want you to unpack if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.680" end="00:25:28.600" style="s2">will the oddness so this is again</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.250" end="00:25:30.520" style="s2">something that you called my attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.600" end="00:25:30.940" style="s2">to I never would have gotten there on my</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.520" end="00:25:34.810" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.940" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">our ATG 13 is the strain that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.810" end="00:25:40.930" style="s2">revealed in 2020 after the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">begins or right 2019 okay so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.930" end="00:25:47.230" style="s2">strain though Oh January 29th I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:49.180" style="s2">was published by she was choosing Lee</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:51.730" style="s2">publishes a sequence she says it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.180" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">closest thing we&#39;ve got to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.730" end="00:25:57.010" style="s2">circulating virus the virus of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.180" end="00:25:59.500" style="s2">circulating in the human population it</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.010" end="00:26:02.890" style="s2">comes from a sample we collected in 2013</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.500" end="00:26:04.920" style="s2">in Yunnan and we didn&#39;t think much of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.890" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">at the time but here it is we&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.920" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">or we had it am I correct that they do</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:13.930" style="s2">not yeah she just mentioned it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">passing and like very short sentence she</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.930" end="00:26:18.790" style="s2">never mentioned the mine she never</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:22.120" style="s2">mentioned pneumonia and it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.790" end="00:26:25.780" style="s2">name from the one that they had given it</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.120" end="00:26:27.730" style="s2">in 2013 and also they don&#39;t cite their</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.780" end="00:26:31.870" style="s2">original publication in which they</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.730" end="00:26:34.690" style="s2">revealed is this original short sequence</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.870" end="00:26:37.510" style="s2">of this strain they initially they</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.690" end="00:26:39.940" style="s2">called it four nine nine one four nine</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.510" end="00:26:42.940" style="s2">one nine nine one which is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.940" end="00:26:46.120" style="s2">of the sample and it&#39;s just odd that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.940" end="00:26:49.740" style="s2">they decided to rename it and never</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.120" end="00:26:52.629" style="s2">mention the like the original strain is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.740" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">absolutely speaking this is unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.629" end="00:26:57.429" style="s2">you would not rename a strain and not at</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">least leave some pointer that explains</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.429" end="00:27:01.690" style="s2">why you renamed it and allows somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:03.100" style="s2">to trace it and I think people should</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.690" end="00:27:06.549" style="s2">actually look at your Twitter feed</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.100" end="00:27:08.519" style="s2">because they can see you as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.549" end="00:27:10.809" style="s2">trying to sort out you&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.519" end="00:27:14.200" style="s2">sequences that may in fact be the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.809" end="00:27:16.419" style="s2">strain under two different names and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.200" end="00:27:18.909" style="s2">simply pose the question on Twitter are</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.419" end="00:27:21.009" style="s2">these two the same right and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.909" end="00:27:24.700" style="s2">out that we now know that they are based</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.009" end="00:27:27.250" style="s2">on well what is well now they claim they</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.700" end="00:27:32.250" style="s2">are is it&#39;s it&#39;s I mean there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.250" end="00:27:35.830" style="s2">wild speculations that maybe maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.250" end="00:27:37.389" style="s2">just they couldn&#39;t bring themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.830" end="00:27:39.820" style="s2">claim that are the same thing because</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.389" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">they just took the the four nine nine</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.820" end="00:27:45.419" style="s2">ones did a little fragment and they kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:48.940" style="s2">of worked around it it put something</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.419" end="00:27:51.580" style="s2">closer to us ours too but maybe the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.940" end="00:27:54.940" style="s2">actual actual initial sequence is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.580" end="00:27:58.840" style="s2">different or maybe it&#39;s extracted out of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.940" end="00:28:01.779" style="s2">the miner samples there&#39;s like this so</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.840" end="00:28:03.879" style="s2">many possibilities and I agree they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.779" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">they&#39;re just you know wild conjecture at</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.879" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">this point but it&#39;s just very odd yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">why would you know scientists not even</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:13.389" style="s2">mentioned not inside themselves there</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.159" style="s2">you know previous work where they</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.389" end="00:28:16.809" style="s2">collected it they should get some you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.159" end="00:28:20.139" style="s2">know additional accolades for it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.809" end="00:28:22.899" style="s2">they just can&#39;t bring themselves to to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.139" end="00:28:25.389" style="s2">to mention this and remain quiet about</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.899" end="00:28:27.970" style="s2">it and still they haven&#39;t explained they</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.389" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">just all that happened is in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.970" end="00:28:33.340" style="s2">internal database there&#39;s some big</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">Chinese database on on viruses all they</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.340" end="00:28:38.409" style="s2">did is they kind of added in the four</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:40.779" style="s2">nine nine one to the description of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.409" end="00:28:43.509" style="s2">RIT G sequence just in brackets which</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.779" end="00:28:45.759" style="s2">kind of indicates that now they have</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.509" end="00:28:48.909" style="s2">confirmed that it&#39;s indeed the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.759" end="00:28:51.730" style="s2">sequence that they collected in 2013 but</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.909" end="00:28:53.140" style="s2">there&#39;s been no official commentary and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.730" end="00:28:55.929" style="s2">there&#39;s been no official explanation</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.140" end="00:28:58.900" style="s2">and even I think in a follow up a paper</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.929" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">they still don&#39;t cite the 2016 paper by</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.900" end="00:29:06.370" style="s2">by by the who Han Institute authors</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:10.030" style="s2">which just very odd behavior so as if</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.370" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">they&#39;re go ahead yeah no I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.030" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">it&#39;s either there I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:17.980" style="s2">uncomfortable with what they&#39;re doing or</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:19.390" style="s2">because I mean it&#39;s obvious that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.980" end="00:29:22.540" style="s2">know once they reveal it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.390" end="00:29:24.460" style="s2">people are gonna arrive at the</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.540" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">one was submitted to genebank in 2013</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:39.010" style="s2">deleted from there so it&#39;s very odd that</p>

<p begin="00:29:48.040" end="00:29:53.280" style="s2">nine one and our ATG thirteen the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.980" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">that they appear to be based on the same</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.850" end="00:30:18.700" style="s2">that happened but I am saying it is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.390" end="00:30:23.740" style="s2">interesting that this lab is behaving in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.700" end="00:30:26.169" style="s2">a scientifically unorthodox unacceptable</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.169" end="00:30:33.130" style="s2">with respect to samples that are now at</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.320" end="00:30:34.780" style="s2">the center of a historical pandemic</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.780" end="00:30:39.010" style="s2">understand what it is that these samples</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">are and what the relationship to each</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.010" end="00:30:44.970" style="s2">other is and then you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">databases what has been your experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.970" end="00:30:50.280" style="s2">looking into these databases in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:52.840" style="s2">figure out what connects to what</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.280" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s another database where there</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.840" end="00:30:58.510" style="s2">was another database by she&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:31:00.520" style="s2">herself like her private not private</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.510" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">personal database it was public at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.520" end="00:31:04.670" style="s2">time and she essentially collected her</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.670" end="00:31:10.010" style="s2">little viral samples or pasted some</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.570" style="s2">little parts of the genome that she</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.010" end="00:31:14.120" style="s2">thought were interesting into this</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">database rather than submit them to gene</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.120" end="00:31:19.730" style="s2">bank or other databases but so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:22.940" style="s2">database had been has been missing it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.730" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">seems to have been deleted the link for</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.940" end="00:31:27.500" style="s2">the download link is no longer available</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:30.350" style="s2">and also that database was kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.500" end="00:31:31.820" style="s2">the midst of a bit of a lot of scandal</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.350" end="00:31:36.560" style="s2">but it was very interesting to see that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.820" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">on December 30th she generally kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.560" end="00:31:42.230" style="s2">scrubbed the database of some mentions</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:46.790" style="s2">of arthropod vectors or like mosquitoes</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.230" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">or she changed those names to not those</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.790" end="00:31:50.330" style="s2">phrases she changed the bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.500" end="00:31:55.270" style="s2">coronaviruses so initially it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.330" end="00:31:59.000" style="s2">database of potential wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.270" end="00:32:01.190" style="s2">coronaviruses and zoonotic interactions</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.000" end="00:32:03.590" style="s2">or actually called switching</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.190" end="00:32:06.650" style="s2">interactions and all those mentions were</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.590" end="00:32:09.500" style="s2">deleted and replaced by just bat and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.650" end="00:32:11.750" style="s2">rodent coronaviruses which you know a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.500" end="00:32:14.150" style="s2">lot of people notice that and maybe at</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.750" end="00:32:16.490" style="s2">the time whoever well it was done under</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.150" end="00:32:17.900" style="s2">she&#39;s jennyline&#39;s ID I think whoever was</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.490" end="00:32:20.060" style="s2">doing the changes probably didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.900" end="00:32:21.980" style="s2">realize that there is a change tracking</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.060" end="00:32:24.500" style="s2">system in place where people people can</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.980" end="00:32:26.560" style="s2">just go back to the previous version of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.500" end="00:32:30.200" style="s2">the description and see the differences</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.560" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">and I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of a minor</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.200" end="00:32:36.650" style="s2">thing but major thing is that now the 60</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:38.390" style="s2">megabytes database that was previously</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.650" end="00:32:41.900" style="s2">available for download is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.390" end="00:32:43.160" style="s2">there you you know the download link if</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.900" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">you click on any just get an empty</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.160" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">archive back and people have tried</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">contacting the host hosting provider of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:52.430" style="s2">the database to check you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:54.680" style="s2">that her backup file can&#39;t we you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.430" end="00:32:57.890" style="s2">get it back online and the response they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.680" end="00:32:59.630" style="s2">got was laughable that I&#39;m sorry we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.890" end="00:33:02.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t keep the backup you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.630" end="00:33:05.420" style="s2">they didn&#39;t keep the backup of the how</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.180" end="00:33:08.060" style="s2">yeah how things can be yeah which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.420" end="00:33:09.920" style="s2">sure there&#39;s biology labs that probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.060" end="00:33:12.170" style="s2">have the backup because it was just one</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.920" end="00:33:14.810" style="s2">double file it&#39;s not that big just 60</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.170" end="00:33:16.970" style="s2">Meg&#39;s and if they have it it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.810" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">creative they could share it because</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.970" end="00:33:20.790" style="s2">many people were down</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:22.470" style="s2">right many people have doubted it in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.790" end="00:33:24.600" style="s2">course of their work I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.470" end="00:33:26.340" style="s2">that like the berry cloud would have it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.600" end="00:33:29.670" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been working on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.340" end="00:33:32.760" style="s2">the similar sequences it&#39;s great to see</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.670" end="00:33:35.580" style="s2">you know what your competitor /</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.760" end="00:33:37.770" style="s2">collaborator has you know to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.580" end="00:33:40.170" style="s2">maybe give you ideas on what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.770" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">working on see their recent submissions</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.170" end="00:33:47.040" style="s2">I think that can give a good idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:49.290" style="s2">types of to a person skilled an art</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.040" end="00:33:51.300" style="s2">could give ideas of what research</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.290" end="00:33:53.610" style="s2">directions the competitors foulest I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.300" end="00:33:56.340" style="s2">sure they&#39;re keeping tabs on on each</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.610" end="00:33:59.730" style="s2">other so yeah if anybody has the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.340" end="00:34:01.500" style="s2">database then they can share it or at</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.730" end="00:34:05.250" style="s2">least check if there&#39;s any kind of odd</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.500" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">sequences maybe just you know no please</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.250" end="00:34:09.750" style="s2">share the database with us if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">haven&#39;t this this is important and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.750" end="00:34:15.380" style="s2">you know it would be great to check some</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:18.570" style="s2">hypotheses here but really that database</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.380" end="00:34:20.880" style="s2">is disproportionately valuable in light</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.570" end="00:34:23.160" style="s2">of the pandemic and what information it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.880" end="00:34:26.340" style="s2">might contain so you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.160" end="00:34:30.330" style="s2">Barrick lab this is Ralph barek in North</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.340" end="00:34:35.150" style="s2">Carolina is that right yes so Ralph</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.330" end="00:34:38.940" style="s2">barek is the the PI in the other major</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.150" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">coronavirus laboratory he&#39;s in the US he</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.940" end="00:34:44.760" style="s2">has collaborated with the the jangly lab</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.380" style="s2">in China at times they are also</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.760" end="00:34:50.310" style="s2">competitors them you know this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.380" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">way science works so they&#39;re friendly</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.310" end="00:34:54.179" style="s2">competitors who are constantly as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:56.220" style="s2">point out in your medium article</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.179" end="00:34:59.250" style="s2">one-upping each other with respect to</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.250" end="00:35:04.980" style="s2">things like this but anyway that it this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.310" end="00:35:08.640" style="s2">deserves to be on the table because the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.980" end="00:35:11.910" style="s2">Barrick lab has been quiet am i right</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:14.580" style="s2">about these abnormalities and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.910" end="00:35:16.460" style="s2">coincidences they have effectively</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.580" end="00:35:19.110" style="s2">signed on to the consensus that a</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:21.530" style="s2">laboratory leak is so preposterous as to</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.110" end="00:35:24.620" style="s2">not worth be worth our consideration</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.530" end="00:35:27.870" style="s2">well I think there was just one brief</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.620" end="00:35:30.090" style="s2">mention by Ralph Barrack that lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.870" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2">is theoretically possible so he</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.090" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">personally I don&#39;t think he said</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:37.880" style="s2">can rule it out that was a while back</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">but he never dove into the details and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.880" end="00:35:43.910" style="s2">one thing he said that at this point we</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:46.050" style="s2">still don&#39;t have any evidence of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.910" end="00:35:50.280" style="s2">natural origin we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.050" end="00:35:51.870" style="s2">intermediate host and since then I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.280" end="00:35:54.120" style="s2">haven&#39;t really heard anything from Ralph</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.870" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">he was just I just heard I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.120" end="00:36:00.210" style="s2">couple of podcasts with him on like</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:03.120" style="s2">biology the biology podcasts this week</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.210" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">in biology I think okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.120" end="00:36:06.270" style="s2">better I&#39;m so glad to hear that he</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.550" style="s2">acknowledges that it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.270" end="00:36:10.890" style="s2">possibility at some level I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.550" end="00:36:13.230" style="s2">mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.890" end="00:36:17.160" style="s2">I hope I&#39;m remembering correctly that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.230" end="00:36:18.840" style="s2">mean I hope that he actually goes on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.160" end="00:36:21.090" style="s2">record then and says what he really</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.840" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">thinks because I don&#39;t think yes anybody</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.380" end="00:36:34.680" style="s2">leak or a possibility of a lab okay so</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.280" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">let&#39;s um we&#39;ve jumped around a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.680" end="00:36:39.470" style="s2">bit we&#39;ve got a massive coincidence in</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:41.910" style="s2">terms of the emergence of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.470" end="00:36:44.190" style="s2">emerging in wuhan is suspicious at</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.910" end="00:36:45.210" style="s2">emerging at the end of the year in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.190" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">winter when the bats would have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.210" end="00:36:49.410" style="s2">hibernating is suspicious even the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:54.050" style="s2">Chinese government now acknowledges that</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.410" end="00:36:57.270" style="s2">the wet market is not the origin point</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.050" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t have in the bat virus it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.270" end="00:37:06.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like the receptor binding</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:08.900" style="s2">domain is not optimized for bats not</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.360" end="00:37:12.120" style="s2">sure did it did they try and affecting</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.900" end="00:37:14.910" style="s2">bats with this the starts to in any case</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.120" end="00:37:16.920" style="s2">so the RBM came from a Pangolin virus</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.910" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">and that that&#39;s the whole now way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.920" end="00:37:22.950" style="s2">solder I want to correct you the RBM did</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">not come from a Pangolin the closest</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">sequence we have is from a Pangolin am I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:30.260" style="s2">right about that it&#39;s not that we know</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:33.300" style="s2">that the RBM came from a Pangolin</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.260" end="00:37:35.940" style="s2">Pangalos offered as the likely</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.300" end="00:37:39.150" style="s2">intermediate because the sequence for it</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.940" end="00:37:42.150" style="s2">so the the binding domain is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.150" end="00:37:45.930" style="s2">important sequence that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.150" end="00:37:49.980" style="s2">proteins that allow the SARS Cove to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:57.270" style="s2">viral particles to invade cells right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:59.070" style="s2">it binds the the AC II particle so am I</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.270" end="00:38:01.470" style="s2">correct we don&#39;t know that this is from</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.070" end="00:38:03.620" style="s2">a Pangolin but we that&#39;s our best guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.470" end="00:38:08.370" style="s2">because of the sequence similarity</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.620" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">well the RBM is from a Pangolin training</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.370" end="00:38:14.790" style="s2">the RB m is nowhere else to be found</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:16.740" style="s2">that our BMS is pretty unique and so and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.790" end="00:38:20.370" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of been throwing a wrench into</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.740" end="00:38:22.320" style="s2">this fill a genetic trees that because</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.370" end="00:38:24.950" style="s2">in all the respects in all the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.320" end="00:38:28.680" style="s2">the sequence rit g13 is the closest</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.950" end="00:38:31.530" style="s2">relative of stars to but in that very</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:33.930" style="s2">narrow strain of the spike protein the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.530" end="00:38:37.620" style="s2">RB m the receptor binding domain that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.930" end="00:38:39.870" style="s2">actually kind of the key to entry of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.620" end="00:38:41.490" style="s2">particular animal because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.870" end="00:38:44.310" style="s2">AC to receptor is different in different</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.490" end="00:38:44.850" style="s2">animals that came up that came from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.310" end="00:38:47.940" style="s2">Pangolin</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.850" end="00:38:50.190" style="s2">and more moreover the more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.940" end="00:38:52.980" style="s2">part is that it actually binds to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:38:55.590" style="s2">human receptor better than a dust to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.980" end="00:38:58.830" style="s2">Pangolin receptor so it seems a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.590" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">optimized or adapted to to humans that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.830" end="00:39:04.500" style="s2">bangle a bangle is although the strain</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:07.190" style="s2">is supposedly extracted from pangolins</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.500" end="00:39:09.570" style="s2">that were smuggled or captured by</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.190" end="00:39:12.330" style="s2">chinese customs from smugglers in</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.570" end="00:39:15.600" style="s2">Guangdong in 2019 and then they sent</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.330" end="00:39:18.270" style="s2">some samples to some labs biology labs</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.600" end="00:39:20.970" style="s2">because those pangolins died of some</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.270" end="00:39:22.740" style="s2">ammonia or something so they suspected I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.970" end="00:39:24.120" style="s2">still think we need to sort this out I</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.740" end="00:39:26.190" style="s2">think we were having a communication</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.120" end="00:39:27.990" style="s2">problem for some reason the sequence is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.190" end="00:39:33.120" style="s2">not a hundred percent identical to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.990" end="00:39:36.870" style="s2">Pangolin binding domain sequence it&#39;s 99</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.120" end="00:39:41.130" style="s2">percent I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s got like I want</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.870" end="00:39:42.900" style="s2">to say how many it only has one I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.130" end="00:39:46.380" style="s2">asked a difference in the receptor</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.900" end="00:39:48.030" style="s2">binding motif there&#39;s a receptor binding</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.380" end="00:39:51.000" style="s2">domain and the receptor binding motif</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.030" end="00:39:55.290" style="s2">they are BM and that one has you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.000" end="00:39:57.450" style="s2">all but one amino acid identical to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.290" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">Pangolin strain and B seven eight nine</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.450" end="00:40:04.200" style="s2">and how big is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:07.760" style="s2">how big is the the motif it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.200" end="00:40:11.970" style="s2">big my memory I mean I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.760" end="00:40:13.980" style="s2">78 or 79 amino acids or one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.970" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">different yeah it&#39;s pretty sure the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.980" end="00:40:21.300" style="s2">domain is is bigger it&#39;s I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">maybe 100 and how what is the percentage</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.300" end="00:40:28.590" style="s2">similarity of the the whole domain well</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:30.300" style="s2">the the RBD the domain is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.590" end="00:40:33.450" style="s2">similar between the three strains</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.300" end="00:40:37.350" style="s2">between starts to the Pangolin and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.450" end="00:40:39.780" style="s2">rit g13 and it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty conserved</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.350" end="00:40:43.740" style="s2">between other with other strains but</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.780" end="00:40:46.980" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the RBM is it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.740" end="00:40:49.080" style="s2">between SARS 200 TG 13 but it&#39;s nearly</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:51.210" style="s2">identical with just one minute</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.080" end="00:40:54.990" style="s2">difference between the Pangolin strain</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.210" end="00:40:57.390" style="s2">and and SARS - and the only thing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.990" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">that it&#39;s identical on the amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.390" end="00:41:01.770" style="s2">level but on the nucleotide level there</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:04.260" style="s2">are some similarities and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.770" end="00:41:07.020" style="s2">actually quite a lot of differences for</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.260" end="00:41:10.860" style="s2">some people to claim that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.020" end="00:41:13.860" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have been like a lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.860" end="00:41:16.440" style="s2">because it would have taken a law like</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.860" end="00:41:19.290" style="s2">for natural passage of the two strains</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.440" end="00:41:21.960" style="s2">to have such a high difference in</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.290" end="00:41:24.630" style="s2">nucleotides although the United States</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.960" end="00:41:26.460" style="s2">the same nucleotides have like a 12%</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.630" end="00:41:27.600" style="s2">difference so you&#39;re talking some short</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.460" end="00:41:30.690" style="s2">sequences you&#39;re talking about what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.600" end="00:41:31.410" style="s2">call synonymous mutations right right</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.690" end="00:41:34.430" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.410" end="00:41:36.900" style="s2">so for those of you who are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.430" end="00:41:39.150" style="s2">grappling to remember your high school</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.900" end="00:41:42.660" style="s2">or college biology because you have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.150" end="00:41:44.760" style="s2">triplet codon and you only have 20 amino</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.660" end="00:41:46.830" style="s2">acids that are possible to be specified</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.760" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of redundancy in the code</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.830" end="00:41:51.300" style="s2">so you can make changes in the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:53.370" style="s2">code that don&#39;t change the sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.300" end="00:41:54.510" style="s2">the protein in question and the protein</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.370" end="00:41:56.430" style="s2">in question is the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.510" end="00:42:01.380" style="s2">because that&#39;s what dictates how much</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.430" end="00:42:03.120" style="s2">affinity this molecule has for the cell</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.380" end="00:42:05.850" style="s2">receptor to which it is binding that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.120" end="00:42:09.450" style="s2">allows the virus to gain access is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.850" end="00:42:11.250" style="s2">a fair summary yeah so when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.450" end="00:42:12.840" style="s2">talking about how similar or how</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.250" end="00:42:14.550" style="s2">different we have to be care</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.840" end="00:42:16.470" style="s2">about whether we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.550" end="00:42:18.840" style="s2">protein in which case you have very</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.470" end="00:42:22.490" style="s2">tight similarity for the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.840" end="00:42:25.230" style="s2">genes in this case RNA which would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.490" end="00:42:27.150" style="s2">more distinct and so then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.230" end="00:42:29.160" style="s2">question about how much time would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:31.200" style="s2">to pass and how much if you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.160" end="00:42:33.930" style="s2">involved in experiment how much passage</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.850" style="s2">in that is moving it from one cell to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.930" end="00:42:37.650" style="s2">the next or one you can also do this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.850" end="00:42:39.510" style="s2">with living animals from one animal to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.650" end="00:42:43.950" style="s2">the next would you have to do to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.510" end="00:42:46.470" style="s2">this level of sequence difference so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.950" end="00:42:49.740" style="s2">want to unpack for us what you think so</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.470" end="00:42:52.110" style="s2">you have our ATG 13 which is the strain</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.740" end="00:42:56.310" style="s2">that is revealed in 2020 by the jangly</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.110" end="00:42:58.740" style="s2">lab you have 4 9 9 1 which is at some</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.310" end="00:43:01.290" style="s2">level the same strain we now know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.740" end="00:43:05.310" style="s2">although we don&#39;t really know what our</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.290" end="00:43:09.960" style="s2">ATG 13 is because am I correct there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.310" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">no physical sample of our ATG 13 well</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.960" end="00:43:14.010" style="s2">this is a good question to I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:17.580" style="s2">because they claim they every sequence</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.010" end="00:43:23.130" style="s2">the the old fecal swab that they took</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.580" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">from the bats in 2013 but and they claim</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.130" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the live virus but they</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:28.710" style="s2">re sequence something and so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:33.060" style="s2">something must be there that the sample</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.710" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">they collected in 2013 and some people</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.060" end="00:43:37.170" style="s2">are yes some people are skeptical at all</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:38.760" style="s2">that RIT g13 event exists that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.170" end="00:43:41.190" style="s2">sample exists that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.760" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">resequenced something people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.190" end="00:43:47.490" style="s2">skeptical about that and think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:50.100" style="s2">maybe they you know came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.490" end="00:43:51.990" style="s2">sequence in other ways other creative</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.100" end="00:43:53.790" style="s2">ways so let&#39;s just let&#39;s just be clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.990" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">about this we don&#39;t have any reason to</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.790" end="00:43:58.020" style="s2">believe one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">what we do as a physical sample but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.020" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">is entirely possible to take a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:07.860" style="s2">let&#39;s say 499 one sequence and to modify</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:10.080" style="s2">it without doing anything in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.860" end="00:44:13.290" style="s2">laboratory and enter a new sequence that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.080" end="00:44:16.080" style="s2">has high analogy 2 4 9 9 1 into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.290" end="00:44:17.850" style="s2">database under a new name so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.080" end="00:44:19.980" style="s2">nothing that prevents this this is on</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.850" end="00:44:23.400" style="s2">the honor system people enter sequences</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.980" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s up to them to provide</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.400" end="00:44:29.660" style="s2">a reference sample or something</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:32.010" style="s2">and other than that we are just simply</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.660" end="00:44:35.130" style="s2">taking them at their word so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.010" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s possible for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.130" end="00:44:42.450" style="s2">possible that our ATG 13 didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:45.510" style="s2">that it&#39;s a a modification of a sequence</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.450" end="00:44:49.130" style="s2">that was created for a purpose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.510" end="00:44:53.340" style="s2">possible that the sample did exist and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.130" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">they did do away with it they disposed</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.340" end="00:44:57.570" style="s2">of it and have only the the text left</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:45:00.570" style="s2">but anyway these are all open</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.570" end="00:45:03.570" style="s2">possibilities and until we have a frank</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.570" end="00:45:05.490" style="s2">discussion coming out of that lab about</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.570" end="00:45:08.700" style="s2">what they did and didn&#39;t do we just are</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.490" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">no specific enough yeah and if they had</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.700" end="00:45:15.150" style="s2">originally sequenced it they can then</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">you know take that sequence recreate the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.150" end="00:45:21.300" style="s2">original virus put it into some cell</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:23.369" style="s2">culture do many experiments on it and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.300" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">will mutate and then they can take the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.369" end="00:45:27.960" style="s2">new mutated virus and re sequence it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:30.359" style="s2">say oh no here it is what we collected</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.960" end="00:45:33.030" style="s2">back in 2013 and you see you know many</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.359" end="00:45:36.330" style="s2">differences from the original sequence</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.030" end="00:45:39.660" style="s2">and as you said it&#39;s just their word</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.330" end="00:45:42.410" style="s2">that in in in science you know people</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.660" end="00:45:45.240" style="s2">take just people at their word and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.410" end="00:45:47.869" style="s2">normally nobody really has any incentive</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.240" end="00:45:50.130" style="s2">to lie which you know in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.869" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">investigation might not be entirely</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.130" end="00:45:53.490" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:55.109" style="s2">so am I correct from the sequence that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.490" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">they have given us that they could</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.109" end="00:46:02.099" style="s2">actually even if there is no physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.710" end="00:46:03.390" style="s2">sample of this virus left in the lab or</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.099" end="00:46:07.050" style="s2">even in nature let&#39;s say it had gone</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.390" end="00:46:09.210" style="s2">extinct they could resurrect that virus</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.050" end="00:46:12.869" style="s2">from the sequence alone current</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.210" end="00:46:15.660" style="s2">technology would allow them to take the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.869" end="00:46:18.089" style="s2">code from a corona virus and install a</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.660" end="00:46:20.940" style="s2">genome that they had effectively written</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.089" end="00:46:21.690" style="s2">from scratch is that correct yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.940" end="00:46:26.190" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.690" end="00:46:30.300" style="s2">if you have the code the sequence you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.190" end="00:46:33.030" style="s2">can just print the DNA the DNA version</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.300" end="00:46:34.980" style="s2">of the RNA virus that&#39;s what is normally</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.030" end="00:46:38.609" style="s2">done in by reverse genetics you print</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.980" end="00:46:39.700" style="s2">like seven fragments of the virus in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.609" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">language of DNA</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.700" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">then you stitch them together and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:49.030" style="s2">you know cells of interest and create</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:51.310" style="s2">one you know one long DNA clone of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.030" end="00:46:53.349" style="s2">underlining RNA virus and then you put</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.310" end="00:46:56.470" style="s2">it into a different cell culture which</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.349" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">turns DNA into RNA and wow you got live</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.470" end="00:47:01.900" style="s2">virus just from you know essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:03.970" style="s2">from a computer and I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.900" end="00:47:06.940" style="s2">done routinely and it was just recently</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.970" end="00:47:09.930" style="s2">done with SARS - in two labs in one</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.940" end="00:47:13.720" style="s2">Swiss lab did it like in in a month</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.930" end="00:47:16.180" style="s2">put together sorry co2 from the sequence</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.720" end="00:47:18.849" style="s2">alone yeah yeah they just download the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.180" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">Chinese sequence ordered the DNA printed</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.849" end="00:47:23.380" style="s2">in Genzyme in the states waited three</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">weeks until they got you know mailed</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.380" end="00:47:28.690" style="s2">back and then within a week they</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">assembled the live virus from the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.690" end="00:47:33.579" style="s2">fragments that they got printed in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:35.560" style="s2">states in Switzerland and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.579" end="00:47:37.510" style="s2">Galveston lab in Texas did pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.560" end="00:47:41.890" style="s2">the same thing it&#39;s a terrifying love</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.510" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">power well yeah that&#39;s I mean biology</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.890" end="00:47:46.869" style="s2">and genetic engineering has been drawing</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:50.109" style="s2">by leaps and bounds and the things you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.869" end="00:47:54.910" style="s2">can do today with genetics or life</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.109" end="00:47:59.260" style="s2">systems yes so you have a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.910" end="00:48:00.700" style="s2">power to to do bad things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.260" end="00:48:02.859" style="s2">we still don&#39;t know about they like</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.700" end="00:48:05.589" style="s2">underlying mechanisms in many organisms</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.859" end="00:48:08.260" style="s2">but we can walk around with them pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.589" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">pretty good yeah we can we can composite</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.260" end="00:48:12.849" style="s2">them we can take pieces from here and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:15.310" style="s2">pieces from there and in fact that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.849" end="00:48:17.980" style="s2">of the things that is very clear in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.310" end="00:48:22.450" style="s2">your your review article that you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.980" end="00:48:25.060" style="s2">is that we now routinely composite</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.450" end="00:48:28.569" style="s2">viruses in order to find out how they</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.060" end="00:48:31.079" style="s2">will function once done so the creation</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.569" end="00:48:33.880" style="s2">of chimeric viruses that for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.079" end="00:48:35.650" style="s2">have assets from one place and assets</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.880" end="00:48:38.410" style="s2">from another place from two different</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.650" end="00:48:41.290" style="s2">ancestral strains and then you can put</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.410" end="00:48:44.050" style="s2">them in an environment and see how they</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.290" end="00:48:46.390" style="s2">infect the cells from a creature or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.050" end="00:48:48.339" style="s2">creature itself and then you can passage</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.390" end="00:48:50.410" style="s2">them one generation to the next either</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.339" end="00:48:52.980" style="s2">of cells or individuals and you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.410" end="00:48:55.050" style="s2">basically guide them evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.980" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">to become better and better at infecting</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.050" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">whatever creature it is and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:01.380" style="s2">discover how the sequence changed in</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.770" end="00:49:03.109" style="s2">order to make them better so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.380" end="00:49:06.140" style="s2">that all of these things are now</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.109" end="00:49:09.750" style="s2">happening in labs routinely presumably</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.140" end="00:49:12.330" style="s2">usually with good intentions</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.750" end="00:49:14.460" style="s2">with the intention of making us safer</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.330" end="00:49:16.290" style="s2">rather than jeopardizing us it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.460" end="00:49:18.630" style="s2">could be weaponized and maybe is</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.290" end="00:49:20.190" style="s2">weaponized sometimes but scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.630" end="00:49:23.670" style="s2">routinely doing these things in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.190" end="00:49:26.609" style="s2">interest of making humanity safer but</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.670" end="00:49:29.010" style="s2">the technology involved in doing these</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.609" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">experiments obviously carries a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.010" end="00:49:35.730" style="s2">tremendous risk you know SARS co2 is bad</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:38.220" style="s2">it&#39;s highly infectious and has a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.730" end="00:49:42.030" style="s2">long list of very dangerous symptoms but</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.220" end="00:49:44.670" style="s2">it obviously has a relatively low death</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.030" end="00:49:47.820" style="s2">rate / infection that could be worse and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.670" end="00:49:50.400" style="s2">the ability for anybody to download a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.820" end="00:49:54.990" style="s2">sequence and with you know what would it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.400" end="00:49:58.380" style="s2">cost to put together a laboratory that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.990" end="00:50:00.600" style="s2">was capable of taking let&#39;s say SARS</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.380" end="00:50:05.460" style="s2">Cove - from the sequence alone and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.600" end="00:50:09.810" style="s2">creating a live infectious virus from</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.460" end="00:50:12.330" style="s2">scratch I guess be in the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.810" end="00:50:15.420" style="s2">thousands of dollars okay that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.330" end="00:50:18.510" style="s2">low number you&#39;re given given for for</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.420" end="00:50:21.840" style="s2">bad bad actor yeah and yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.510" end="00:50:26.790" style="s2">print the sequence for like a thirty</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.840" end="00:50:28.710" style="s2">thousand base sequence but thirty</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.790" end="00:50:30.600" style="s2">thousand dollars if you order it from</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.710" end="00:50:33.630" style="s2">the states if you do it in Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.600" end="00:50:37.290" style="s2">probably ten times less you can if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.630" end="00:50:40.560" style="s2">really you can order the sequence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.290" end="00:50:43.800" style="s2">yeah I mean there&#39;s so many zeroes that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.560" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">like companies they&#39;ll do custom you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.800" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">know DNA printing protein printing if</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:54.119" style="s2">you need like an actual like a peptide</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:59.250" style="s2">or protein but yeah any kind of biology</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.119" end="00:51:00.990" style="s2">work is now outsourced there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.250" end="00:51:03.480" style="s2">providers and a lot of them in China</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.990" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s cheap or India it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.480" end="00:51:13.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a cheap commodity now</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:17.640" style="s2">creation of dna/rna fe okay actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.800" end="00:51:20.270" style="s2">yeah we we one thing we just briefly</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.270" end="00:51:30.390" style="s2">chimeric viruses and this is true about</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.690" end="00:51:35.420" style="s2">SARS Cove - SARS - in precisely the rpm</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.390" end="00:51:37.890" style="s2">the receptor binding motif that is</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.890" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">supposedly it&#39;s it&#39;s the closest to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.400" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">Pangolin strain and everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:50.430" style="s2">closest to our our ATG 13 so it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:54.060" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about a natural origin we</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.430" end="00:51:56.700" style="s2">we have to explain somehow how the two</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.060" end="00:51:59.310" style="s2">virus is recombined and of course it can</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.700" end="00:52:02.730" style="s2">happen in nature but it would take a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.310" end="00:52:05.820" style="s2">Pangolin of the bat meeting you know at</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.730" end="00:52:07.470" style="s2">the same spot for the virus to recombine</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.820" end="00:52:09.360" style="s2">it needs to be in the same cell like two</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.470" end="00:52:11.550" style="s2">different strains to recombine the need</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.360" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">to enter the same cell and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.550" end="00:52:17.850" style="s2">start replicating therefore for them to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:20.340" style="s2">have a chance to recombine and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.850" end="00:52:22.040" style="s2">really unexplained at this point how</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.340" end="00:52:27.750" style="s2">this can happen between because</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.040" end="00:52:30.870" style="s2">pangolins and bats are not known to can</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.750" end="00:52:33.600" style="s2">inhabit similar areas or have any kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.870" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">of parties together yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.600" end="00:52:38.520" style="s2">not impossible but it&#39;s also right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">got to be considered ecologically highly</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.520" end="00:52:46.350" style="s2">unlikely and you know the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:47.790" style="s2">that&#39;s the way bats roost creates large</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.350" end="00:52:50.670" style="s2">populations and the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.790" end="00:52:52.080" style="s2">small animals means that effectively you</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.670" end="00:52:54.060" style="s2">can have a large number of paths but</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.080" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">pangolins aren&#39;t like this and so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.060" end="00:52:58.890" style="s2">number of individuals is low which means</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.780" style="s2">the number of opportunities for an</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.890" end="00:53:03.300" style="s2">animal to be infected by two different</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.780" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">strains that then get to combine is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.300" end="00:53:10.190" style="s2">pretty low Pangolin it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.490" end="00:53:15.510" style="s2">suspicious proposal as the intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.190" end="00:53:18.360" style="s2">host so you know not impossible but at</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.510" end="00:53:20.310" style="s2">some level we ought to be obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.360" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">finding whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.310" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">wild intermediate host is because it</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.250" style="s2">will tell us an awful lot and it will</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:28.050" style="s2">allow us to put this lab origin</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.250" end="00:53:31.410" style="s2">hypothesis to rest if indeed it should</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.050" end="00:53:34.110" style="s2">be put to rest but one does not get the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.410" end="00:53:39.180" style="s2">sense that this is a focus and it really</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.110" end="00:53:43.620" style="s2">it just it it needs to be yeah some</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.180" end="00:53:46.350" style="s2">reason we don&#39;t see a huge effort in</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.620" end="00:53:50.160" style="s2">China to to find this intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.350" end="00:53:52.320" style="s2">animal or to serve the other Yunnan</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.160" end="00:53:55.080" style="s2">strains or maybe go back to that cave</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.320" end="00:53:57.600" style="s2">but I think we should really go back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.080" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">the fridge in the wine Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.600" end="00:54:02.460" style="s2">check the miners samples those four</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:04.290" style="s2">miners that had SARS antibodies we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.460" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">should really try to extract the genome</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.290" end="00:54:10.680" style="s2">of underlying stars like wires that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:16.500" style="s2">have I think that that would offer some</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.680" end="00:54:18.150" style="s2">clues to as to what this is yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.500" end="00:54:21.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a great point</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.150" end="00:54:24.900" style="s2">just to fill in the what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.690" end="00:54:27.900" style="s2">and why we&#39;re focused here when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.900" end="00:54:30.030" style="s2">generate a phylogeny that is a tree that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.900" end="00:54:31.710" style="s2">tells you how closely related organisms</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.030" end="00:54:33.810" style="s2">are to each other we&#39;ve all seen these</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.710" end="00:54:37.590" style="s2">things these bifurcating trees of of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.810" end="00:54:39.090" style="s2">animals or plants or whatever you can do</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.590" end="00:54:42.540" style="s2">this with viruses too of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.090" end="00:54:45.360" style="s2">and the problem with SARS Cove too is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.540" end="00:54:47.310" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t land in one place if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.360" end="00:54:49.140" style="s2">sequence one part of its genome or in</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.310" end="00:54:52.200" style="s2">fact most of its genome it lands in one</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.140" end="00:54:55.650" style="s2">place closely a affinis affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.200" end="00:54:57.000" style="s2">the Rhino Louis horseshoe bat virus and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.650" end="00:54:59.160" style="s2">if you sequence this other very</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.000" end="00:55:01.950" style="s2">important part it comes out much closer</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.160" end="00:55:03.930" style="s2">to this Pangolin version of the virus so</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.950" end="00:55:06.450" style="s2">not impossible the two would have come</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.930" end="00:55:09.330" style="s2">together but very unlikely ecologically</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.450" end="00:55:12.440" style="s2">and so really the question is which is</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.330" end="00:55:14.820" style="s2">more likely that some very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.440" end="00:55:18.870" style="s2">ecological event took place in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.820" end="00:55:21.360" style="s2">individual Pangolin somewhere or that a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.870" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">laboratory in an attempt to create a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.360" end="00:55:24.810" style="s2">virus that was highly infectious and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:28.010" style="s2">therefore highly relevant to the study</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.810" end="00:55:30.630" style="s2">of human pandemics emerging from bats</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.010" end="00:55:33.640" style="s2">would have composited two viruses</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.630" end="00:55:36.220" style="s2">thereby solving a problem</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.640" end="00:55:39.009" style="s2">for the virus that the virus would have</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.220" end="00:55:41.230" style="s2">a very difficult time solving on its own</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.009" end="00:55:43.660" style="s2">in other words the jump to humans would</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.230" end="00:55:45.489" style="s2">typically be a very short-lived jump and</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.660" end="00:55:47.410" style="s2">if you were in a laboratory and you were</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.489" end="00:55:49.509" style="s2">worried about things jumping into humans</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.410" end="00:55:51.549" style="s2">you might make that jump for it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.509" end="00:55:52.749" style="s2">you would composite two viruses you</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.549" end="00:55:56.109" style="s2">would make a virus that had capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.749" end="00:55:57.730" style="s2">that no wild virus does in order to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.109" end="00:56:00.299" style="s2">what happens next and if that thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.730" end="00:56:03.430" style="s2">escaped it might be that we are living</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.299" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">downstream of that terrible phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.430" end="00:56:07.630" style="s2">if it escaped from the lab having been</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.880" style="s2">composited for the purpose of making it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.630" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">more infectious or interesting to them</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.880" end="00:56:13.869" style="s2">in some ways than many of the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:18.819" style="s2">that are so unusual that we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.869" end="00:56:22.869" style="s2">like the very large range of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.819" end="00:56:25.269" style="s2">that kovat 19 produces might be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.869" end="00:56:29.049" style="s2">result of the compositing and the</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.049" end="00:56:33.309" style="s2">would have evolutionarily imbued the</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.309" end="00:56:38.019" style="s2">especially if it was passaged in human</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.609" end="00:57:00.730" style="s2">things interface with humans so you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.569" end="00:57:03.309" style="s2">arguably this cell lineage could have</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.730" end="00:57:06.220" style="s2">been used to passage viruses that had</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.300" end="00:58:57.730" style="s2">want to I want to I want to slow you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.560" end="00:59:00.430" style="s2">down just so people get it the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.730" end="00:59:03.100" style="s2">cleaving peptide the protein that does</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.430" end="00:59:04.270" style="s2">the cutting is resident in the human</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.100" end="00:59:06.490" style="s2">cell am I correct</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.270" end="00:59:09.910" style="s2">right okay yes thirty aces in the human</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.490" end="00:59:10.290" style="s2">cell and then there is a sequence oh go</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.910" end="00:59:15.010" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.290" end="00:59:17.530" style="s2">yeah and now in extracellular matrix as</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.010" end="00:59:20.740" style="s2">well it&#39;s actually eat both inside cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.530" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">and outside cells and some proteases are</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.740" end="00:59:26.890" style="s2">actually found on the membrane and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:28.800" style="s2">fewer inside is a very efficient site to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.890" end="00:59:32.020" style="s2">be cleaved because it can be cleaved by</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.800" end="00:59:36.060" style="s2">various families of these proteases and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.020" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">this increases the viral tropism much</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.060" end="00:59:41.230" style="s2">greater than without the site okay again</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:42.340" style="s2">i want to get this into into</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.230" end="00:59:46.210" style="s2">understandable language</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.340" end="00:59:48.310" style="s2">the human being is producing a protein</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.210" end="00:59:53.650" style="s2">the purpose of this protein what it does</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.310" end="00:59:55.690" style="s2">is it cuts a particular sequence that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.650" end="00:59:58.900" style="s2">finds and it cuts in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.690" end="01:00:01.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like a a surgical instrument that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.900" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">looks only for one sequence and slice</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.210" end="01:00:05.710" style="s2">whenever it finds it is that correct</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:09.670" style="s2">yeah yeah you know it&#39;s correct I know</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.710" end="01:00:14.020" style="s2">it isn&#39;t no that&#39;s not true I think we</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.670" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">we know similarly but so okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.020" end="01:00:21.600" style="s2">virus by providing the sequence at which</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:24.520" style="s2">this existing protease already cuts</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.600" end="01:00:26.410" style="s2">takes a quantum leap in its ability to</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.520" end="01:00:28.930" style="s2">infect human cells</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.410" end="01:00:31.360" style="s2">is that correct and in fact its ability</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.930" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">to move between species am I correct</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.360" end="01:00:37.420" style="s2">about that too right yeah okay it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:39.640" style="s2">shown that the addition of your insight</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.420" end="01:00:42.670" style="s2">greatly enhances the ability of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.640" end="01:00:45.970" style="s2">virus to infect different types of cells</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.670" end="01:00:49.930" style="s2">and cells from different animals because</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.970" end="01:00:54.130" style="s2">now the virus isn&#39;t so dependent on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.930" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">exact match of its kind of spike binding</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.130" end="01:01:00.520" style="s2">domain and the receptor human receptor</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:01:03.370" style="s2">but the actual fusion can happen to two</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.520" end="01:01:06.580" style="s2">other cells where the attachment might</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.370" end="01:01:10.170" style="s2">not be as strong like just from a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.580" end="01:01:13.240" style="s2">species standpoint okay so and these</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.170" end="01:01:17.770" style="s2">foreign sites again a sequence at which</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.240" end="01:01:21.600" style="s2">these human-made proteases slice that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.770" end="01:01:27.790" style="s2">fern site where do we find it in natural</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.600" end="01:01:31.990" style="s2">coronaviruses well in in in at that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.790" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">particular spot we don&#39;t really see fear</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.990" end="01:01:36.550" style="s2">in sites in beta coronaviruses I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:38.620" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a cleavage site but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.550" end="01:01:40.930" style="s2">cleaved by different protease is not not</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.620" end="01:01:44.710" style="s2">as efficient for like at least in humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.930" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">as fiorina&#39;s we see them in like alpha</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.710" end="01:01:52.180" style="s2">coronaviruses or other families of</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:55.420" style="s2">coronaviruses but we know that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.180" end="01:01:58.060" style="s2">introduction of this your insight just</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.420" end="01:02:00.070" style="s2">from previous experiments in culture and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.060" end="01:02:02.550" style="s2">other viruses as well and in influenza</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.070" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">that it greatly increases the</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.550" end="01:02:09.010" style="s2">transmissibility and expands the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:11.290" style="s2">repertoire of a virus in terms of types</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.010" end="01:02:14.080" style="s2">of cells and types of animals it can</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.290" end="01:02:15.670" style="s2">infect okay so a fern site greatly</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.080" end="01:02:17.860" style="s2">enhances transmission</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.670" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">but now you&#39;ve talked about alpha and</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.860" end="01:02:22.980" style="s2">beta coronaviruses so where do we see</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:26.050" style="s2">for insights and where don&#39;t we see them</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.980" end="01:02:28.870" style="s2">we see them in in alpha Colonel viruses</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.050" end="01:02:32.230" style="s2">what are ours one in MERS what our alpha</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.870" end="01:02:34.570" style="s2">coronaviruses it&#39;s just a different</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.230" end="01:02:36.760" style="s2">family of I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.570" end="01:02:39.940" style="s2">get you to spell out how unlikely it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.760" end="01:02:43.500" style="s2">that you that you would find this fern</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.940" end="01:02:47.110" style="s2">site in a horseshoe bat derived</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.500" end="01:02:50.710" style="s2">coronavirus from the wild based on what</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.110" end="01:02:53.620" style="s2">we see in viruses of that type that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.710" end="01:02:56.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve encountered well just by you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.620" end="01:03:00.250" style="s2">the phylogeny or surveillance of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.620" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">beta coronavirus lineage having none of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.250" end="01:03:06.820" style="s2">them having the fear in sight and this</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:09.160" style="s2">one no stars to having one it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.820" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">just statistically very unlikely to</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.160" end="01:03:16.390" style="s2">expect it to see there and moreover I</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:18.760" style="s2">think when we put them in cell culture I</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.390" end="01:03:23.860" style="s2">think it tends to actually mutate away</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.760" end="01:03:25.560" style="s2">so um very interesting in cell culture</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.860" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">what kind of cells</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.560" end="01:03:30.340" style="s2">I think they saw it in like viral cells</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:35.140" style="s2">the green monkey</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.340" end="01:03:37.450" style="s2">give me cell line but I&#39;m you know I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.140" end="01:03:39.820" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really prepared to going this</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.450" end="01:03:43.450" style="s2">deep about into the likely actual</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.820" end="01:03:47.320" style="s2">experiments on the fioor insight but yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.450" end="01:03:50.800" style="s2">are just very unlikely to see it in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.320" end="01:03:53.910" style="s2">type of corona virus and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.800" end="01:03:56.530" style="s2">it seems that there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.910" end="01:03:59.170" style="s2">evolutionary not evolutionary some kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.530" end="01:04:02.140" style="s2">of selection pressure against it in in</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.170" end="01:04:04.660" style="s2">the beta coronavirus lineage because of</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.140" end="01:04:07.000" style="s2">you know in it maybe in in bats and in</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.660" end="01:04:10.120" style="s2">horseshoe bats that beta chronic virus</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:13.510" style="s2">is normally are found that that fear</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.120" end="01:04:17.260" style="s2">inside is actually detrimental to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.510" end="01:04:19.240" style="s2">virus so so if i can just translate this</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.260" end="01:04:21.340" style="s2">probably there&#39;s a trade off cost to</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.240" end="01:04:23.730" style="s2">having a fear inside right and so what</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.340" end="01:04:27.010" style="s2">happens is if you allow the thing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.730" end="01:04:28.660" style="s2">evolve under natural circumstances or</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.010" end="01:04:30.910" style="s2">semi natural circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.660" end="01:04:34.569" style="s2">fern site comes apart because some other</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.910" end="01:04:37.630" style="s2">priority is higher what we see in Tsar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.569" end="01:04:42.670" style="s2">Cove too is a fern site that is not</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.630" end="01:04:47.260" style="s2">found in any of the natural lineages</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.670" end="01:04:50.829" style="s2">that you know come from bats for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.260" end="01:04:54.010" style="s2">and so the question is did something</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.829" end="01:04:56.520" style="s2">really unusual happen here that put that</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.010" end="01:05:00.309" style="s2">fern site either through an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.520" end="01:05:03.460" style="s2">mechanism or through a hybridization</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.309" end="01:05:05.740" style="s2">event did a fern site get added to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.460" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">virus that almost never has one when we</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.740" end="01:05:12.010" style="s2">find it in fact in the wild never does</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:14.349" style="s2">have it or did a laboratory decide well</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.010" end="01:05:17.500" style="s2">one thing that we could study is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.349" end="01:05:19.329" style="s2">happens if there was a fern site that</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.500" end="01:05:21.069" style="s2">would create a virus that had capacities</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.329" end="01:05:23.470" style="s2">we haven&#39;t seen and maybe we&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.069" end="01:05:25.990" style="s2">investigate those capacities or third</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.470" end="01:05:28.450" style="s2">possibility you tell me if any of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.990" end="01:05:31.539" style="s2">are off the off the map of actual</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.450" end="01:05:34.539" style="s2">possibilities third possibility is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.539" end="01:05:36.670" style="s2">passage experiment generates a fern site</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.539" end="01:05:38.650" style="s2">because the conditions that are provided</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.670" end="01:05:41.440" style="s2">to the virus make it advantageous and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.650" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">whatever the trade-off is is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.440" end="01:05:46.990" style="s2">prioritized by the laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:49.990" style="s2">environment so fern side-dish is short</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.990" end="01:05:53.980" style="s2">in sequence am I correct yes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.990" end="01:05:57.279" style="s2">four amino acids four amino acid so</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.980" end="01:05:59.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a very short site and so you</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.279" end="01:06:01.779" style="s2">could get there through chimerism and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.799" end="01:06:05.849" style="s2">you could get there through passages</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.779" end="01:06:09.910" style="s2">am I right about that yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.849" end="01:06:12.190" style="s2">so the the question then is is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.910" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">highly unusual fact of a fern site</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.190" end="01:06:17.410" style="s2">showing up in this virus that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:20.309" style="s2">creating the kovat 19 pandemic the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.410" end="01:06:23.260" style="s2">result of some natural event that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.309" end="01:06:25.799" style="s2">very unusual or is it the result of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.260" end="01:06:28.450" style="s2">laboratory manipulation which would make</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.799" end="01:06:32.140" style="s2">good sense if you were of a mind set to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.450" end="01:06:34.950" style="s2">study potentially emergent pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.140" end="01:06:34.950" style="s2">causing viruses</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.310" end="01:06:44.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a big question and unexplained</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.420" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">at this point and I think there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.140" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">one interesting aspect of the site the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:54.370" style="s2">fear insight that I find interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:58.080" style="s2">that it the way it&#39;s constructed in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.370" end="01:07:01.660" style="s2">nucleotide code it actually has a</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.080" end="01:07:05.410" style="s2">special like a digestion aid enzyme site</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.660" end="01:07:08.290" style="s2">that could greatly help with screening</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.410" end="01:07:10.030" style="s2">for mutations in cell culture to screen</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.290" end="01:07:15.850" style="s2">if they&#39;re fever inside is actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.030" end="01:07:17.950" style="s2">mutated away or on the contrary to</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.850" end="01:07:22.030" style="s2">actually screen for colonies that still</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.950" end="01:07:26.740" style="s2">have it the foul on for one restriction</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.030" end="01:07:30.550" style="s2">enzyme site and the way it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.740" end="01:07:33.940" style="s2">implemented for amino acids that are</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.550" end="01:07:38.050" style="s2">coded for the first two arginines are</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.940" end="01:07:41.560" style="s2">coded by three unusual codons that are</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.050" end="01:07:45.010" style="s2">in general found quite rarely in in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.560" end="01:07:47.890" style="s2">sequence and but they what they do allow</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.010" end="01:07:50.290" style="s2">for is for this new restriction enzyme</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.890" end="01:07:52.300" style="s2">to be present in the kind of in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.290" end="01:07:55.630" style="s2">insert and this is another thing that</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.300" end="01:07:57.460" style="s2">the fear inside is not only interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.630" end="01:08:00.790" style="s2">is that it&#39;s there it&#39;s interesting in</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.460" end="01:08:04.630" style="s2">the way it occurred in the in the SARS</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.790" end="01:08:06.940" style="s2">to sequence and it starts to genome is</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.630" end="01:08:09.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s in there by an</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.940" end="01:08:11.890" style="s2">insertion and it&#39;s insert of 12</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.040" end="01:08:15.850" style="s2">nucleotides whereas usually you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.890" end="01:08:17.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not unusual for viruses to develop</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.850" end="01:08:18.760" style="s2">this few insights that didn&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.620" end="01:08:21.010" style="s2">before but usually happens through</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.760" end="01:08:24.390" style="s2">mutations like the sequence length</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.010" end="01:08:27.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change it&#39;s not like you see a</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.390" end="01:08:30.670" style="s2">magical appearance of 12 new nucleotides</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.460" end="01:08:33.000" style="s2">at the very spot that now has a few</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.670" end="01:08:36.780" style="s2">inside which is what happened and SARS -</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.000" end="01:08:40.810" style="s2">so these two interesting you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.780" end="01:08:43.870" style="s2">occurrences are again they&#39;re not proof</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.810" end="01:08:46.049" style="s2">of anything but they&#39;re just add to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.870" end="01:08:49.020" style="s2">bag of questions that</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.049" end="01:08:51.390" style="s2">kind of weighing heavily on the scale</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.020" end="01:08:56.390" style="s2">they&#39;re very conspicuous when taken</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.390" end="01:08:59.010" style="s2">together right yes absolutely yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.390" end="01:09:01.799" style="s2">all right so you&#39;ve got a fern site that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.010" end="01:09:03.740" style="s2">shows up out of nowhere in a play in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.799" end="01:09:08.330" style="s2">virus that would typically not have one</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.740" end="01:09:11.010" style="s2">you have the fact that the sequence is</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.330" end="01:09:14.069" style="s2">added rather than the result of</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.010" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">mutations of the sequence that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.069" end="01:09:21.020" style="s2">present that&#39;s also conspicuous so that</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:23.700" style="s2">could be evidence of a laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.020" end="01:09:26.240" style="s2">inserting this sequence rather than it</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.700" end="01:09:30.380" style="s2">resulting from a natural process and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.240" end="01:09:33.569" style="s2">then you point two flanking sequences</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.380" end="01:09:36.089" style="s2">that if I understand you right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.569" end="01:09:38.490" style="s2">suggesting they could be used as a kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.089" end="01:09:43.620" style="s2">of indicator sometimes scientists will</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.490" end="01:09:44.670" style="s2">add something to a a modification so</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.620" end="01:09:47.670" style="s2">that they can detect whether the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.670" end="01:09:50.310" style="s2">modification is present in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.670" end="01:09:52.220" style="s2">sample and so in this case if furan is</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.310" end="01:09:54.720" style="s2">something that would tend to evolve away</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.220" end="01:09:56.040" style="s2">as a result of a trade off cost you</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.720" end="01:09:58.350" style="s2">might want a little indicator to tell</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.040" end="01:10:00.390" style="s2">you whether it was still present is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.350" end="01:10:03.750" style="s2">what you&#39;re getting at yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.390" end="01:10:06.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not even the flank flanking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.750" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">actually inside of the insert in the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.570" end="01:10:13.340" style="s2">the insert is done the the codons coding</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.600" end="01:10:16.410" style="s2">for it the two arginines enable this new</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.340" end="01:10:19.020" style="s2">restriction enzyme site to be there and</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.410" end="01:10:22.010" style="s2">it could be used for you know our flip</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.020" end="01:10:25.980" style="s2">the restriction length fragment</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.010" end="01:10:28.320" style="s2">polymorphism screening process to very</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.980" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">quickly very efficiently see if your</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.320" end="01:10:33.540" style="s2">colony of a virus has this fear inside</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:35.400" style="s2">of a dozen so you can if you want it to</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.540" end="01:10:37.590" style="s2">stay in the colony you can screen the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.400" end="01:10:39.120" style="s2">colonies that have it pretty efficiently</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.590" end="01:10:42.720" style="s2">without you know having to bother to</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.120" end="01:10:45.540" style="s2">re-sequence the whole thing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.720" end="01:10:48.570" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean it all of it could be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.540" end="01:10:50.520" style="s2">result of just occurring naturally but</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.570" end="01:10:53.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just as you said taking together</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.520" end="01:10:56.220" style="s2">all those coincidences just add up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.400" end="01:10:59.680" style="s2">the point where you start you know being</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.220" end="01:11:01.840" style="s2">somewhat suspicious about this being</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.680" end="01:11:04.600" style="s2">handmade rather than you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:07.390" style="s2">evolutionary selected for and another</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.600" end="01:11:10.810" style="s2">point I want to make is that the lab</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.390" end="01:11:12.730" style="s2">League doesn&#39;t necessarily mean handmade</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.810" end="01:11:15.000" style="s2">it could also mean like everything that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.730" end="01:11:17.590" style="s2">happens in nature can happen in the lab</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.000" end="01:11:19.870" style="s2">especially given that the lab is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.590" end="01:11:22.750" style="s2">place where all of these pangolins and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.870" end="01:11:24.460" style="s2">bats all are brought together or even</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.750" end="01:11:28.900" style="s2">maybe you know they&#39;re put in the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.460" end="01:11:32.650" style="s2">culture maybe inadvertently and so just</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.900" end="01:11:34.030" style="s2">like some viral justsay that it they</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.650" end="01:11:36.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s the process of natural</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.030" end="01:11:38.710" style="s2">selection that is at work here all</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.490" end="01:11:43.420" style="s2">natural selection can work in a lab you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.710" end="01:11:46.810" style="s2">know just in holding pans for bats which</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.420" end="01:11:48.970" style="s2">the Wuhan CDC had live bats to extract</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.810" end="01:11:50.350" style="s2">virus samples from I don&#39;t know if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.970" end="01:11:52.120" style="s2">have Bengal is but they have Bengal is</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.350" end="01:11:55.420" style="s2">like Bengal is in Guangdong and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.120" end="01:11:59.380" style="s2">Wildlife Refuge Center where the Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.420" end="01:12:02.710" style="s2">customs sent the smuggle pangolins to so</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:05.380" style="s2">just because you know some some</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.710" end="01:12:07.150" style="s2">biologists thing that all the hallmarks</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.380" end="01:12:09.490" style="s2">that we see in the virus like what</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.150" end="01:12:11.830" style="s2">Anderson and others are claiming they</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.490" end="01:12:14.350" style="s2">think these are much more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.830" end="01:12:16.150" style="s2">occur through national selection again</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.350" end="01:12:20.500" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t preclude a lab liek</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.150" end="01:12:22.720" style="s2">national selection can be at work in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.500" end="01:12:24.940" style="s2">lab without even the scientists knowing</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.720" end="01:12:26.830" style="s2">it they can just you know have some</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.940" end="01:12:30.550" style="s2">infected bats and effects of penguins</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.830" end="01:12:33.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually a much higher odds of</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.550" end="01:12:36.250" style="s2">happening in a lab than in some remote</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.220" end="01:12:38.260" style="s2">location in Yunnan or Malaysia where the</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.250" end="01:12:39.730" style="s2">pangolins normally live and even if it</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.260" end="01:12:42.190" style="s2">does happen there it still doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.730" end="01:12:44.740" style="s2">explain how this materializes in new Han</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.190" end="01:12:47.560" style="s2">without managing to infect anyone along</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.740" end="01:12:49.210" style="s2">the way yeah a big question so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.560" end="01:12:51.130" style="s2">funny you mentioned this issue of</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.210" end="01:12:52.840" style="s2">evolution taking place in the lab</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.130" end="01:12:54.970" style="s2">without scientists knowing about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.840" end="01:12:57.700" style="s2">because of course one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.970" end="01:13:02.400" style="s2">people know about me at this point has</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.700" end="01:13:04.600" style="s2">to do with my discovery or my prediction</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.400" end="01:13:07.530" style="s2">hypothesis that made a prediction that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.600" end="01:13:09.550" style="s2">the long telomeres that we see in</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.530" end="01:13:11.470" style="s2">laboratory mice are actually not</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.550" end="01:13:12.929" style="s2">indicative of the nature of mice</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.470" end="01:13:15.300" style="s2">generally but are indicative of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.929" end="01:13:17.369" style="s2">and kind of evolutionary pressure that</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.300" end="01:13:19.860" style="s2">exists in the breeding colonies that</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.369" end="01:13:21.479" style="s2">nobody had recognized and so we now know</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.860" end="01:13:23.070" style="s2">that this is right and that those long</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.479" end="01:13:25.139" style="s2">those telomeres were elongated by</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.070" end="01:13:27.780" style="s2">selection in the laboratory or in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.139" end="01:13:29.820" style="s2">breeding colony and of course that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.780" end="01:13:31.739" style="s2">not the intent of the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.820" end="01:13:33.239" style="s2">breeding these mice in fact they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.739" end="01:13:35.099" style="s2">even aware that they were exerting a</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.239" end="01:13:36.689" style="s2">strong Selective pressure but it was</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.099" end="01:13:38.130" style="s2">enough to radically elongate the</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.689" end="01:13:41.219" style="s2">telomeres so this kind of thing happens</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.130" end="01:13:43.619" style="s2">all the time and in this case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.219" end="01:13:47.670" style="s2">particularly dangerous because if this</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.619" end="01:13:52.679" style="s2">virus was passaged in the lab under</p>

<p begin="01:13:57.749" end="01:14:02.459" style="s2">well cancers have particular</p>

<p begin="01:14:02.459" end="01:14:05.610" style="s2">that you would choose would have</p>

<p begin="01:14:05.610" end="01:14:10.979" style="s2">would have a lot to say potentially</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.199" end="01:14:13.439" style="s2">about the way the virus functions also</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.979" end="01:14:16.380" style="s2">you point out the issue of evolving away</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.439" end="01:14:17.459" style="s2">to the extent that this virus might have</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.380" end="01:14:20.219" style="s2">been passaged</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.459" end="01:14:22.170" style="s2">and favored to adapt to certain cells</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.219" end="01:14:26.030" style="s2">that might be giving us advantages at</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.170" end="01:14:27.900" style="s2">the moment like for example the</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.030" end="01:14:29.729" style="s2">difficult time the virus has</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.900" end="01:14:31.590" style="s2">transmitting itself outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.729" end="01:14:33.179" style="s2">well the laboratory is an indoor</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.590" end="01:14:35.039" style="s2">environment it&#39;s possible that something</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.179" end="01:14:37.709" style="s2">was selected for that made it</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.039" end="01:14:41.489" style="s2">particularly transmissible indoors and</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.709" end="01:14:42.869" style="s2">it did so it cost at expense to it in</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.489" end="01:14:44.670" style="s2">terms of how transmissible it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.869" end="01:14:46.860" style="s2">outdoors and what&#39;s going to happen then</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.670" end="01:14:49.679" style="s2">is over time it&#39;s going to become more</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.860" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">transmissible outdoors so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.679" end="01:14:53.159" style="s2">if that story is right or not I mean we</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:55.739" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this came from the lab or</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.159" end="01:14:59.849" style="s2">it didn&#39;t but if it did and that has had</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.739" end="01:15:02.610" style="s2">effects on its nature as a virus then</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.849" end="01:15:04.860" style="s2">not knowing that is going to cause us to</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.610" end="01:15:07.170" style="s2">make the problem worse because to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.860" end="01:15:11.130" style="s2">extent that right now we have a virus</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.170" end="01:15:12.989" style="s2">that we can interact outside and not</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.130" end="01:15:15.780" style="s2">transmit it to each other we would be</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.989" end="01:15:17.249" style="s2">very wise to act carefully so that it</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.780" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">does not learn the trick of being</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.249" end="01:15:21.780" style="s2">transmitted outside and if we&#39;re casual</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:25.139" style="s2">about outside it will evolve in that</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.780" end="01:15:26.410" style="s2">direction so one thing I really hope</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.139" end="01:15:29.350" style="s2">people get from our disguise</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.410" end="01:15:32.890" style="s2">is that this is not a question of blame</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.350" end="01:15:34.750" style="s2">this is not a question of who cares it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.890" end="01:15:37.090" style="s2">now a human pandemic and let&#39;s deal with</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.750" end="01:15:39.730" style="s2">it this is a matter that has very</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.090" end="01:15:41.950" style="s2">important implications for the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.730" end="01:15:44.500" style="s2">that we are facing how long we will face</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.950" end="01:15:48.370" style="s2">it how many people will die if it is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.500" end="01:15:50.440" style="s2">wild derived virus we need to know that</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.370" end="01:15:53.280" style="s2">and the way we&#39;re gonna find that out is</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.440" end="01:15:55.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna settle this by finding a</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.280" end="01:15:57.940" style="s2">population of some other creature and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:15:59.590" style="s2">intermediate hosts in the wild but</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.940" end="01:16:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s going to require transparency</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.590" end="01:16:08.620" style="s2">with respect to what went on in this lab</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.360" end="01:16:12.250" style="s2">in wuhan yeah I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.620" end="01:16:12.720" style="s2">gonna get it I mean well hold all the</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.720" end="01:16:18.790" style="s2">unless there&#39;s immense international</p>

<p begin="01:16:18.790" end="01:16:25.080" style="s2">well yes a whistleblower would be great</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.460" end="01:16:29.650" style="s2">I would love a whistleblower but Yuri</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.080" end="01:16:31.500" style="s2">you have no idea I think how important</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.650" end="01:16:41.350" style="s2">and affect you are having on this story</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.500" end="01:16:44.740" style="s2">right we saw yeah I hope not too oh yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.350" end="01:16:46.630" style="s2">you&#39;re not important hello yes Yuri is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.740" end="01:16:48.010" style="s2">completely unimportant and he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.630" end="01:16:49.890" style="s2">know what he&#39;s talking about just ignore</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.010" end="01:16:53.890" style="s2">him but if we were to put that aside</p>

<p begin="01:18:30.409" end="01:18:35.449" style="s2">believe it to be the most likely</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.550" end="01:18:37.849" style="s2">explanation at this point if we are on</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.449" end="01:18:40.880" style="s2">the right track there than it is urgent</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.849" end="01:18:43.610" style="s2">that the virality community stop telling</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.880" end="01:18:45.380" style="s2">us a fiction and that they come clean</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.610" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">with what they know and they understand</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.380" end="01:18:50.929" style="s2">and I think in order for that to happen</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:53.900" style="s2">it is incumbent on us to be clear that</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.929" end="01:18:56.929" style="s2">let&#39;s say the worst is true let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.900" end="01:19:00.380" style="s2">that this virus was created in the lab</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.929" end="01:19:02.599" style="s2">that it was the result of a chimeric</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.380" end="01:19:04.219" style="s2">virus that was then passage through</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.599" end="01:19:06.559" style="s2">human cells and that this explains</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.219" end="01:19:08.769" style="s2">something about the way it behaves now</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.559" end="01:19:13.429" style="s2">that&#39;s escaped into the human population</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.769" end="01:19:16.190" style="s2">that does not mean that this is Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.429" end="01:19:18.739" style="s2">in origin the scientific community was</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.190" end="01:19:21.949" style="s2">engaged in these experiments yes this</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.739" end="01:19:24.260" style="s2">most likely would have come from the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.949" end="01:19:26.539" style="s2">lab in Wuhan but that lab was involved</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.260" end="01:19:30.190" style="s2">in international discussions the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.539" end="01:19:33.260" style="s2">granting agencies include the NIH so</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.190" end="01:19:36.469" style="s2">this is this is a global problem we</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.260" end="01:19:39.380" style="s2">share responsibility for it and the most</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.469" end="01:19:41.420" style="s2">important thing is that in an effort not</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.380" end="01:19:43.400" style="s2">to take responsibility that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.420" end="01:19:45.650" style="s2">bury the evidence of what the virus is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.400" end="01:19:47.749" style="s2">because that evidence is essential for</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.650" end="01:19:50.030" style="s2">us figuring out how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.749" end="01:19:51.800" style="s2">which is obviously to any reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.030" end="01:19:54.020" style="s2">person the most important question on</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.020" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">absolutely and the second most important</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.960" end="01:20:03.210" style="s2">question I think is the nature of gainin</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:05.670" style="s2">functional studies and the you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.210" end="01:20:08.520" style="s2">should they be like what&#39;s the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.670" end="01:20:12.060" style="s2">and should they be maybe reconsidered</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.520" end="01:20:14.190" style="s2">and another moratorium on global market</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.060" end="01:20:17.520" style="s2">Orion on them should be maybe in place</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.190" end="01:20:20.100" style="s2">at least for a few years until we sort</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.520" end="01:20:22.830" style="s2">out you know what are the benefits that</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.100" end="01:20:25.290" style="s2">humanity is gaining from these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.830" end="01:20:27.630" style="s2">studies yeah because what the humanity</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.290" end="01:20:29.840" style="s2">was promised originally that they would</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.630" end="01:20:33.210" style="s2">those studies would help prevent</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.840" end="01:20:38.670" style="s2">pandemics that would provide vaccines</p>

<p begin="01:20:52.080" end="01:20:57.060" style="s2">vaccine from from those studies that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.360" end="01:21:02.909" style="s2">were before they were conducted again I</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.060" end="01:21:06.150" style="s2">might be a little biased here but so far</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.909" end="01:21:09.530" style="s2">I just don&#39;t have any I don&#39;t know of</p>

<p begin="01:21:43.969" end="01:21:49.290" style="s2">so this this is a second topic yes well</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.190" end="01:21:52.050" style="s2">okay I I agree with this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.290" end="01:21:53.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a third one too so the first one</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.050" end="01:21:57.540" style="s2">is what do we do about the circulating</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.880" end="01:21:59.639" style="s2">SARS co2 virus which depends in part on</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.540" end="01:22:01.670" style="s2">figuring out what it is adapted for</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.639" end="01:22:04.860" style="s2">which might be a laboratory environment</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.670" end="01:22:05.940" style="s2">the second question is what do we do</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.860" end="01:22:08.580" style="s2">about gain-of-function</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.940" end="01:22:10.920" style="s2">research going forward in light of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.580" end="01:22:12.840" style="s2">danger even if this wasn&#39;t a lab leak</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.920" end="01:22:14.670" style="s2">we now are suddenly aware of all of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.840" end="01:22:16.920" style="s2">things that are going on in a lab and</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.670" end="01:22:19.740" style="s2">that that it is plausible that this</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.920" end="01:22:22.830" style="s2">pandemic emerged from a lab tells us</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.740" end="01:22:24.360" style="s2">that this is a this is a major global</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.830" end="01:22:26.370" style="s2">concern and we need to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.360" end="01:22:32.460" style="s2">to do and then I would say the third</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.370" end="01:22:36.420" style="s2">thing on that list is the fact that this</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.460" end="01:22:39.510" style="s2">work is now possible even if we have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.420" end="01:22:43.260" style="s2">scientific moratorium does not prevent</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.510" end="01:22:44.970" style="s2">somebody from taking over that research</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.260" end="01:22:49.910" style="s2">even if we stop doing it in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.970" end="01:22:49.910" style="s2">scientific community what stops some</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.870" end="01:22:56.160" style="s2">country that is interested in changing</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.790" end="01:23:00.750" style="s2">its ranking in the world power structure</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.160" end="01:23:04.290" style="s2">or a malevolent organization that wished</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.750" end="01:23:06.660" style="s2">to use it to its own ends and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.290" end="01:23:10.020" style="s2">will say it&#39;s not even difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.660" end="01:23:11.400" style="s2">figure out a perfectly amoral entity</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.020" end="01:23:14.580" style="s2">somebody who just really didn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.400" end="01:23:18.030" style="s2">about other people could use this</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.580" end="01:23:20.160" style="s2">technology to greatly increase their own</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.030" end="01:23:23.160" style="s2">power and wealth and it&#39;s not hard to</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.160" end="01:23:27.950" style="s2">figure out how they would do it so we</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.160" end="01:23:30.870" style="s2">have a problem we have now generated the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.950" end="01:23:34.020" style="s2">technology to do things which having</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.870" end="01:23:36.630" style="s2">been generated and shared publicly</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.020" end="01:23:39.030" style="s2">discussed in literature are now</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.630" end="01:23:43.610" style="s2">available to people that do not share</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.030" end="01:23:47.970" style="s2">our values and that is a big concern</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.610" end="01:23:51.210" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a tough one is bioterrorism</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.970" end="01:23:55.680" style="s2">it was a very tough question it and have</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.210" end="01:23:59.700" style="s2">become a much more urgent cause of</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.680" end="01:24:02.820" style="s2">concern after some bad actors that were</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.700" end="01:24:05.550" style="s2">probably not bright enough to to see the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.820" end="01:24:07.260" style="s2">potential of bioterrorism after this</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.550" end="01:24:10.680" style="s2">pandemic they probably could have woken</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.260" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">up to oh and you don&#39;t even need a lab</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.680" end="01:24:15.630" style="s2">now I can what I need to do is collect</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:19.560" style="s2">some samples from that hour or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.630" end="01:24:22.570" style="s2">steal samples from labs or</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.560" end="01:24:24.520" style="s2">samples of even-even this virus and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.570" end="01:24:26.860" style="s2">release it strategically in places where</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.520" end="01:24:29.980" style="s2">people don&#39;t expect it&#39;s church or</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.860" end="01:24:32.770" style="s2">subway system or something and yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.980" end="01:24:35.350" style="s2">can just wreak havoc on economies of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.770" end="01:24:38.620" style="s2">countries that you you know wait to see</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.350" end="01:24:41.800" style="s2">go down well you can some big problem</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.620" end="01:24:44.680" style="s2">you could do that and I also just as a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.800" end="01:24:47.470" style="s2">mental exercise I was you know early on</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.680" end="01:24:49.390" style="s2">in the discussion of could this have</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.470" end="01:24:50.230" style="s2">come from a lab could it be a bioweapon</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.390" end="01:24:52.270" style="s2">and all that there was lots of</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.230" end="01:24:54.160" style="s2">discussion about whether or not this</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.270" end="01:24:58.110" style="s2">virus would make any sense as a weapon</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.160" end="01:25:01.810" style="s2">and I agree that if your purpose was</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.110" end="01:25:03.610" style="s2">military effectively this virus is not a</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.810" end="01:25:06.460" style="s2">particularly good choice because so many</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.610" end="01:25:07.900" style="s2">people are asymptomatic but that does</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.460" end="01:25:11.530" style="s2">not have to be what was on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.900" end="01:25:13.870" style="s2">minds and I really hesitate to put this</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.530" end="01:25:16.900" style="s2">idea into the world but my feeling is</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.870" end="01:25:19.390" style="s2">it&#39;s so obvious that my being quiet</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.900" end="01:25:21.700" style="s2">about it doesn&#39;t help so probably better</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.390" end="01:25:31.300" style="s2">that we are all sobered up and aware of</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.700" end="01:25:35.470" style="s2">this the if one decided to create such a</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.300" end="01:25:38.410" style="s2">virus and release it one could pretty</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.470" end="01:25:41.380" style="s2">reliably guess that it was going to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.410" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">a negative impact on let&#39;s say air</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.380" end="01:25:50.290" style="s2">travel hotels cruises these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:53.470" style="s2">things and obviously the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.290" end="01:25:54.970" style="s2">markets are such that if you can predict</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.470" end="01:25:56.800" style="s2">when nobody else can that these</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.970" end="01:26:00.310" style="s2">particular industries are about to take</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.800" end="01:26:01.870" style="s2">a huge hit you can take small amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.310" end="01:26:04.120" style="s2">money and turn it into large amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.870" end="01:26:05.710" style="s2">money or take large amounts of money and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.120" end="01:26:08.500" style="s2">turn it into gargantuan quality</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.710" end="01:26:09.880" style="s2">quantities of money for just simply</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.500" end="01:26:10.450" style="s2">being able to predict what others don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.880" end="01:26:15.550" style="s2">see coming</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.450" end="01:26:19.480" style="s2">and that fact means that motive here</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.550" end="01:26:21.070" style="s2">could be utterly mundane now again there</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.480" end="01:26:23.170" style="s2">is no evidence that this was</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.070" end="01:26:25.830" style="s2">intentionally released by anybody and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.170" end="01:26:28.739" style="s2">think you and I are both believers that</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.830" end="01:26:31.489" style="s2">most probable explanation is</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.739" end="01:26:35.340" style="s2">well-intentioned research that</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.489" end="01:26:38.489" style="s2">resulted in a leak nobody foresaw but I</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.340" end="01:26:40.560" style="s2">have to say one other possibility again</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.489" end="01:26:42.540" style="s2">zero evidence for it but it has to be on</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.560" end="01:26:45.060" style="s2">the list of things that could explain</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.540" end="01:26:46.890" style="s2">the phenomena that we see is that if</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.060" end="01:26:48.210" style="s2">somebody did create the virus Wuhan</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.890" end="01:26:50.400" style="s2">would be the kind of place you would</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.210" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">want to release it in order to hide your</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.400" end="01:26:57.120" style="s2">tracks right because if it&#39;s released in</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:27:00.330" style="s2">will on then the obvious you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.120" end="01:27:01.920" style="s2">obvious interpretation is that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.330" end="01:27:03.750" style="s2">laboratories in Wuhan and there are two</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.920" end="01:27:08.100" style="s2">of them that study back coronaviruses</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.750" end="01:27:10.620" style="s2">that one of them made an error but yet</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.100" end="01:27:14.219" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably have to be a huge inside</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.620" end="01:27:18.929" style="s2">job for them to know that one would have</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.219" end="01:27:22.620" style="s2">the are ATG strain really you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.929" end="01:27:25.110" style="s2">setting up these dues because you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.620" end="01:27:29.160" style="s2">the stars - so close to the strain that</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.110" end="01:27:31.949" style="s2">one is you&#39;ve had well so I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.160" end="01:27:34.980" style="s2">your logic assuming our ATG 13 is what</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.949" end="01:27:38.420" style="s2">we think it is and would you say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.980" end="01:27:40.440" style="s2">the similarity to four nine nine one</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.420" end="01:27:42.780" style="s2">similarity to four nine nine one is</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.440" end="01:27:48.750" style="s2">sufficient that somebody would have had</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.780" end="01:27:50.370" style="s2">to have they would have had to have lots</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.750" end="01:27:52.199" style="s2">of information about what was going on</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.370" end="01:27:55.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s unlikely that some malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.199" end="01:27:58.260" style="s2">force it&#39;s not impossible that somebody</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.110" end="01:28:00.030" style="s2">would release a bat like coronavirus in</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.260" end="01:28:01.080" style="s2">Wuhan in order to hide their tracks but</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.030" end="01:28:03.449" style="s2">the chances that they would get</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.080" end="01:28:08.060" style="s2">something so close to our ATG thirteen</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.449" end="01:28:11.489" style="s2">and four nine nine one is pretty low I</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.060" end="01:28:14.280" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not impossible but it would be</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.489" end="01:28:20.250" style="s2">someone with really deep knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.280" end="01:28:23.250" style="s2">what was doing so I mean probably if an</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.250" end="01:28:25.800" style="s2">actor of that caliber was contemplating</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.250" end="01:28:30.390" style="s2">something like this that they do a lot</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.800" end="01:28:32.060" style="s2">of the homework and well that&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.390" end="01:28:34.620" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.060" end="01:28:35.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a remote possibility there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.620" end="01:28:37.620" style="s2">evidence for it but I think actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.940" end="01:28:41.510" style="s2">we&#39;re modeling something that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.620" end="01:28:43.829" style="s2">see people be better about which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.510" end="01:28:46.289" style="s2">conspiracies exist as well</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.829" end="01:28:48.599" style="s2">huge concern going forward yes a huge</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.289" end="01:28:50.669" style="s2">concern going forward and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.599" end="01:28:53.909" style="s2">learn how to talk about the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.669" end="01:28:56.010" style="s2">without being labeled crazy for engaging</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.909" end="01:28:58.260" style="s2">in even considering it and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.010" end="01:29:00.449" style="s2">what you&#39;ve just seen is two people who</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.260" end="01:29:05.129" style="s2">know something about this story and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.449" end="01:29:06.989" style="s2">relevant scientific details and you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.129" end="01:29:09.359" style="s2">I think we&#39;re both pretty skeptical that</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.989" end="01:29:17.729" style="s2">this has unfolded now but we&#39;re worried</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.359" end="01:29:19.949" style="s2">that it could unfold in the future yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.729" end="01:29:22.760" style="s2">I hope we&#39;re wrong too and I hope that</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.949" end="01:29:26.459" style="s2">yeah best possible from my perspective</p>

<p begin="01:29:26.459" end="01:29:34.109" style="s2">comes from the wild through some unusual</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.929" end="01:29:36.179" style="s2">hard to imagine series Vaca logical</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.109" end="01:29:39.809" style="s2">events that we are capable of</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.179" end="01:29:42.510" style="s2">discovering and figuring out so the lab</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.809" end="01:29:45.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t at fault they can be exonerated</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.510" end="01:29:47.010" style="s2">and we can sober up on the basis that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.030" end="01:29:48.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve been now through this exercise and</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.010" end="01:29:51.359" style="s2">learned the lessons that it has to teach</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.839" end="01:29:52.589" style="s2">us and we can figure out what we should</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.359" end="01:29:55.079" style="s2">think about gain-of-function research</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.589" end="01:29:57.629" style="s2">and we should think about what the heck</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.079" end="01:30:00.209" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do about the amazing power</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.629" end="01:30:04.849" style="s2">that malevolent forces now have at their</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.209" end="01:30:08.699" style="s2">disposal at ever lower price points</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.849" end="01:30:10.800" style="s2">right and they were they always have</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.699" end="01:30:13.589" style="s2">almost have to be some kind of really</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.800" end="01:30:17.099" style="s2">broad surveillance of new viral</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.589" end="01:30:20.369" style="s2">outbreaks or just outbreaks throughout</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.099" end="01:30:22.919" style="s2">the world to where need there needs to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.369" end="01:30:26.269" style="s2">be some kind of like one big agency I</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.919" end="01:30:26.269" style="s2">think there&#39;s a nuclear agency</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.359" end="01:30:29.999" style="s2">monitoring like the possible</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.129" end="01:30:32.309" style="s2">bioterrorism</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.999" end="01:30:35.089" style="s2">and if there is a cluster of similar</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.309" end="01:30:38.609" style="s2">infections you know one one geography</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.089" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">just really trying to sequence quickly</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.609" end="01:30:43.439" style="s2">what is the agent behind this and</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.320" end="01:30:47.219" style="s2">hopefully you know not let it get out</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.439" end="01:30:49.379" style="s2">the way that this one got out and yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.219" end="01:30:52.619" style="s2">gotta say like even without any</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.379" end="01:30:57.090" style="s2">conspiracy theories or a lab leak the</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.619" end="01:31:00.420" style="s2">way it was handled by one government or</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.090" end="01:31:02.510" style="s2">Chinese government just not imposing the</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.420" end="01:31:05.010" style="s2">log down soon enough and letting people</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.510" end="01:31:08.400" style="s2">celebrate the Chinese New Year and they</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.010" end="01:31:13.260" style="s2">intermingle and leave the country I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.400" end="01:31:17.690" style="s2">that alone is pretty disappointing and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.260" end="01:31:20.550" style="s2">in the future we really need like really</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.690" end="01:31:23.489" style="s2">quickly isolate geographies where</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.550" end="01:31:26.219" style="s2">outbreaks happened so that we can avoid</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.489" end="01:31:29.520" style="s2">global pandemic on the scale is</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.219" end="01:31:32.190" style="s2">completely crazy that this is and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.520" end="01:31:34.830" style="s2">afraid we&#39;re just beginning to see the</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.190" end="01:31:37.980" style="s2">numbers just you know start growing even</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.830" end="01:31:40.980" style="s2">further in other continents on the</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.980" end="01:31:45.840" style="s2">countries like now Africa and South</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.980" end="01:31:48.270" style="s2">America reporting high growth so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.840" end="01:31:51.389" style="s2">afraid we&#39;re not there yet</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.270" end="01:31:54.659" style="s2">to see this play out lets you spend any</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.389" end="01:31:57.480" style="s2">play oh yeah I share I share those those</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.659" end="01:32:00.659" style="s2">fears with you and I do feel like as bad</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.480" end="01:32:02.909" style="s2">as this is this is the ultimate trial</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.659" end="01:32:05.699" style="s2">run this is the thing that Sobers you up</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.909" end="01:32:07.949" style="s2">and you know I hope there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.699" end="01:32:11.219" style="s2">willingness to consider the general</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.949" end="01:32:15.739" style="s2">style of problem because I know that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.219" end="01:32:15.739" style="s2">over the last gosh what it would it be</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.159" end="01:32:24.719" style="s2">2008 financial crisis 2011 Fukushima</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.260" end="01:32:28.190" style="s2">Aliso Canyon and I don&#39;t know what was</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.719" end="01:32:31.320" style="s2">that 2017-18</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.190" end="01:32:35.040" style="s2">anyway we keep having this situation</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.320" end="01:32:39.030" style="s2">where we discover what some industry is</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.040" end="01:32:42.030" style="s2">doing after is too late when some of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.030" end="01:32:45.659" style="s2">Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.030" end="01:32:47.790" style="s2">of Mexico so I constantly feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.659" end="01:32:49.889" style="s2">learning what I needed to know after the</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.790" end="01:32:51.360" style="s2">accident has already happened and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.889" end="01:32:53.280" style="s2">what I really want is somebody to</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.360" end="01:32:55.380" style="s2">fast-forward that process so I can know</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.280" end="01:32:58.590" style="s2">all of the processes that we&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.380" end="01:32:59.790" style="s2">in that are unbelievably dangerous so</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.590" end="01:33:03.270" style="s2">that we can talk about them ahead of</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.790" end="01:33:04.920" style="s2">time rather than once the the cats out</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.270" end="01:33:09.119" style="s2">of the bag</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.920" end="01:33:10.110" style="s2">and you know this may be the worst of</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.119" end="01:33:13.410" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.110" end="01:33:15.450" style="s2">terms of the destruction economic and</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.410" end="01:33:18.030" style="s2">human that ultimately comes out of it</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.450" end="01:33:21.060" style="s2">and frankly even if this thing evolves</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.030" end="01:33:24.840" style="s2">into something with flu-like levels of</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.060" end="01:33:29.130" style="s2">hazard that humanity is stuck with even</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.840" end="01:33:31.260" style="s2">that would be a major setback I mean we</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.130" end="01:33:33.720" style="s2">have flu circulating every year that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.260" end="01:33:35.790" style="s2">big problem for humans to have a second</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.720" end="01:33:38.580" style="s2">one of those if that&#39;s what this turned</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.790" end="01:33:44.430" style="s2">into would be a huge disaster going</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.580" end="01:33:46.200" style="s2">forward so we are playing with fire go</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.430" end="01:33:48.030" style="s2">ahead yeah we&#39;re not even sure about the</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.200" end="01:33:50.700" style="s2">long-term consequences of this it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.030" end="01:33:53.340" style="s2">been six months that we have kind oldest</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.700" end="01:33:55.970" style="s2">virus we don&#39;t know if it can hide and</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.340" end="01:33:58.920" style="s2">become a chronic infection like the</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.970" end="01:34:01.230" style="s2">feline peritonitis which is also a</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.920" end="01:34:03.960" style="s2">corona virus if you&#39;d actually learn to</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.230" end="01:34:05.790" style="s2">hide in in the immune cells and then it</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.960" end="01:34:09.450" style="s2">just becomes fatal and like ten percent</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.790" end="01:34:12.390" style="s2">of the effect it gets I hope this is not</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.450" end="01:34:17.630" style="s2">into the case with this one yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.390" end="01:34:19.740" style="s2">it&#39;s you know there could be long-term</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.630" end="01:34:21.470" style="s2">consequences there which is not even</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.740" end="01:34:24.470" style="s2">aware of</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.470" end="01:34:24.470" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.810" end="01:34:35.330" style="s2">I think Donald Rumsfeld be coding that</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.380" end="01:34:37.710" style="s2">guy you know he&#39;s like the Yogi Berra of</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.330" end="01:34:40.710" style="s2">video political phenomena or something</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.710" end="01:34:43.170" style="s2">but I agree with you this thing could</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.710" end="01:34:46.800" style="s2">hide in neurological tissue it could</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.170" end="01:34:49.710" style="s2">hide in immunological tissue it could be</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.800" end="01:34:51.840" style="s2">it could learn to change at a rate that</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.710" end="01:34:53.880" style="s2">would allow individuals to be reinfected</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.840" end="01:34:55.170" style="s2">multiple times over a lifetime we just</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.880" end="01:34:59.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know what we&#39;re playing with here</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.170" end="01:35:01.560" style="s2">and male reproductive system they</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.730" end="01:35:06.920" style="s2">already have issues of the first stars</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.560" end="01:35:10.170" style="s2">or you know autopsies saw-like infected</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.920" end="01:35:11.970" style="s2">going out and you know there were</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.170" end="01:35:14.910" style="s2">reports in China with male fertility</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.970" end="01:35:19.140" style="s2">issues of people after having had this</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.910" end="01:35:22.170" style="s2">SARS - so yeah it&#39;s just I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.140" end="01:35:23.420" style="s2">like scare people but I&#39;m pretty scared</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.170" end="01:35:26.390" style="s2">myself that like</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.420" end="01:35:27.410" style="s2">long-term this can be a bad bad one yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.390" end="01:35:29.360" style="s2">I agree</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.410" end="01:35:36.500" style="s2">like flu I mean flu is bad enough but</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.360" end="01:35:38.780" style="s2">like chronic flu lightning side yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.500" end="01:35:43.310" style="s2">find myself in these conversations all</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.780" end="01:35:46.340" style="s2">the time to where people are I mean in</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.310" end="01:35:50.660" style="s2">in my country people have been convinced</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.340" end="01:35:53.330" style="s2">by our president amongst others to treat</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.660" end="01:35:55.310" style="s2">this as more trivial than it is and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.330" end="01:35:58.550" style="s2">keep trying to alert people that just</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.310" end="01:36:02.210" style="s2">the size of the unknowns here the</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.550" end="01:36:03.620" style="s2">magnitude of them is so great that we</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.210" end="01:36:07.670" style="s2">are wise to be treating this very</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.620" end="01:36:10.070" style="s2">seriously yeah at this point if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.670" end="01:36:13.429" style="s2">is still unconvinced that this is much</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.070" end="01:36:16.030" style="s2">more serious than the flu living under a</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.429" end="01:36:18.590" style="s2">rock but initially we all kind of were</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.030" end="01:36:22.760" style="s2">just based on the previous track record</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.590" end="01:36:25.190" style="s2">of other viruses other outbreaks even</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.760" end="01:36:27.710" style="s2">the corona viruses and SARS and murders</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.190" end="01:36:29.540" style="s2">were pretty bad but like comparatively</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.710" end="01:36:30.410" style="s2">it was just a few thousand people they</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.540" end="01:36:33.290" style="s2">burned out again</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.410" end="01:36:37.130" style="s2">yeah exactly and that&#39;s what we thought</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.290" end="01:36:38.960" style="s2">you know or many people thought I me</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.130" end="01:36:40.910" style="s2">included in the beginning that I was</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.960" end="01:36:42.949" style="s2">just another you know something seasonal</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.910" end="01:36:46.040" style="s2">from China that we get every year and I</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.949" end="01:36:48.860" style="s2">just usually subsides pretty quickly and</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.040" end="01:36:49.250" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly you exactly what I thought</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.860" end="01:36:52.010" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.250" end="01:36:52.910" style="s2">it was I remembered SARS and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.010" end="01:37:03.860" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.910" end="01:37:10.040" style="s2">that&#39;s bad but yeah limited so let me</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.860" end="01:37:13.940" style="s2">ask you two more questions one your</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.040" end="01:37:22.880" style="s2">experience since releasing your medium</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.940" end="01:37:26.080" style="s2">piece well it wasn&#39;t very pleasant I</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.880" end="01:37:29.449" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a lot of positive feedback</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.080" end="01:37:33.310" style="s2">but the share of the negative feedback I</p>

<p begin="01:37:33.370" end="01:37:40.490" style="s2">very vicious just you know for some</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.220" end="01:37:44.770" style="s2">reason people start attacking me</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.490" end="01:37:47.500" style="s2">personally yeah yeah questioning my</p>

<p begin="01:37:59.690" end="01:38:06.680" style="s2">mean I suggested initially for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.260" end="01:38:09.530" style="s2">just to read with a skeptical mind and</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.680" end="01:38:15.500" style="s2">analyze for themselves just don&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.530" end="01:38:17.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t really put a lot of my own views</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.500" end="01:38:19.310" style="s2">on in the article I just pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.570" end="01:38:21.770" style="s2">summarized of facts of course I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.310" end="01:38:23.870" style="s2">call her it with my views but you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.770" end="01:38:25.820" style="s2">you can do your own analysis and if you</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.870" end="01:38:27.590" style="s2">think I made a mistake just you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.820" end="01:38:30.320" style="s2">point out the mistakes rather than say</p>

<p begin="01:38:36.950" end="01:38:43.730" style="s2">neighborhood what they were trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.320" end="01:38:46.610" style="s2">was make you hurt to dissuade you from</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.730" end="01:38:48.470" style="s2">continuing and to make an example of you</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.610" end="01:38:50.840" style="s2">so that others would know not to make</p>

<p begin="01:38:50.840" end="01:38:56.500" style="s2">but the error that you made was doing an</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.660" end="01:39:00.080" style="s2">honest analysis and sharing what you</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.500" end="01:39:04.610" style="s2">discovered with the public so my sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.080" end="01:39:07.100" style="s2">is we needed you to do that and I know</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.610" end="01:39:12.830" style="s2">that it as much as I was already quite</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.100" end="01:39:16.690" style="s2">suspicious it gave me a tremendous boost</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.830" end="01:39:20.360" style="s2">in terms of understanding exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.690" end="01:39:24.080" style="s2">the suspicions were rationally based on</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.360" end="01:39:27.980" style="s2">and how to follow the trail into a realm</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.080" end="01:39:30.110" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not biotech cellular</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.980" end="01:39:33.620" style="s2">biology was never my primary interest so</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.110" end="01:39:35.090" style="s2">just having somebody guide me into the</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.620" end="01:39:36.860" style="s2">literature that was relevant to this</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.090" end="01:39:38.780" style="s2">since I didn&#39;t know anything about what</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.860" end="01:39:42.830" style="s2">was taking place with coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.780" end="01:39:44.300" style="s2">research that was all new to me so what</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.830" end="01:39:47.600" style="s2">you did needed to be done which is</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.300" end="01:39:53.610" style="s2">exactly why you were punished for it</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.600" end="01:39:58.680" style="s2">that said yeah no go ahead well yes and</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.610" end="01:40:00.210" style="s2">it did I mean if whoever had to reach</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.680" end="01:40:04.050" style="s2">the goal of making me feel unpleasant</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.210" end="01:40:06.990" style="s2">they they did so but the initial kind of</p>

<p begin="01:40:06.990" end="01:40:12.720" style="s2">that I get mostly positive feedback of</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.390" end="01:40:14.910" style="s2">people saying that it did open their</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.720" end="01:40:16.890" style="s2">eyes to at least the scale of</p>

<p begin="01:40:21.900" end="01:40:27.900" style="s2">lab leak theories is to them still</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.560" end="01:40:30.270" style="s2">highly unlikely the fact that there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.900" end="01:40:32.510" style="s2">much dangerous research around and still</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.270" end="01:40:35.370" style="s2">goes on to them that was a revelation</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.510" end="01:40:39.630" style="s2">and in parallel some some scientists</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.370" end="01:40:44.340" style="s2">have reached out and said that they you</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.630" end="01:40:47.010" style="s2">know support they definitely support the</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.340" end="01:40:48.720" style="s2">idea that we cannot rule out the lab</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.010" end="01:40:52.470" style="s2">leak at this point and that should be</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.720" end="01:40:56.730" style="s2">considered like on an equal basis with</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.470" end="01:40:58.500" style="s2">any other hypothesis as opposed to some</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.730" end="01:41:01.950" style="s2">people somewhere all just cleaning this</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.500" end="01:41:04.860" style="s2">is sheer lunacy a conspiracy yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.950" end="01:41:08.100" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been suggesting to my audience</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.860" end="01:41:10.350" style="s2">that the conspiracy theory is a stigma a</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.100" end="01:41:12.540" style="s2">term that&#39;s loaded with stigma designed</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.350" end="01:41:14.700" style="s2">designed for a purpose</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.540" end="01:41:16.650" style="s2">conspiracy hypothesis is really what</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.700" end="01:41:20.300" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about yes it does appear</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.650" end="01:41:23.360" style="s2">at the very least that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.300" end="01:41:25.500" style="s2">conspiracy to prevent us from</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.360" end="01:41:30.030" style="s2">investigating what happened here in</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.500" end="01:41:32.400" style="s2">other words the unnatural alignment of</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.030" end="01:41:35.340" style="s2">virologist with each other around a</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.400" end="01:41:39.620" style="s2">story that doesn&#39;t stand up that does</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.340" end="01:41:44.940" style="s2">appear to be a kind of collusion now</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.620" end="01:41:49.830" style="s2">there&#39;s also other evidence how&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.940" end="01:41:55.410" style="s2">computer ok now it&#39;s ok now what</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.830" end="01:41:58.520" style="s2">happened yeah well I think I might have</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.410" end="01:42:01.270" style="s2">been hacked I just started doing really</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.520" end="01:42:04.760" style="s2">things and connecting to the internet I</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.270" end="01:42:07.910" style="s2">just you&#39;ve had computer problems but</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.760" end="01:42:10.430" style="s2">probably malware yeah I don&#39;t know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.910" end="01:42:12.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to claim it it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.430" end="01:42:15.080" style="s2">but swell to people I agree that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.950" end="01:42:17.240" style="s2">other computer issues at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.080" end="01:42:19.010" style="s2">computers are looking computers are</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.240" end="01:42:20.810" style="s2">complex things go wrong with them you</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.010" end="01:42:24.820" style="s2">never know I&#39;ve had computer problems</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.810" end="01:42:28.100" style="s2">too of late it&#39;s pretty dramatic in fact</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.820" end="01:42:31.130" style="s2">could be nothing you know of anybody</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.100" end="01:42:32.840" style="s2">else who&#39;s been courageously</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.130" end="01:42:38.840" style="s2">investigating this hypothesis you might</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.840" end="01:42:40.400" style="s2">have had some trouble all right so take</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.840" end="01:42:42.140" style="s2">that fer for what it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.400" end="01:42:44.090" style="s2">people have computer I mean look there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.140" end="01:42:45.860" style="s2">nobody who&#39;s watching this podcast it</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.090" end="01:42:48.110" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a computer they screw up</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.860" end="01:42:51.170" style="s2">right things happen on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.110" end="01:42:53.840" style="s2">there does come a point at which your</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.170" end="01:42:56.450" style="s2">problems are severe enough mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.840" end="01:42:59.780" style="s2">enough and form a kind of pattern with</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.450" end="01:43:03.400" style="s2">other people who are also using their</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.780" end="01:43:06.890" style="s2">computers to discuss and investigate</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.400" end="01:43:09.980" style="s2">possibilities that obviously powerful</p>

<p begin="01:43:09.980" end="01:43:15.440" style="s2">simply have to ask the question are my</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.750" end="01:43:18.260" style="s2">computer glitches normal or is what</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.440" end="01:43:20.920" style="s2">seems like an anomalous rate of computer</p>

<p begin="01:43:20.920" end="01:43:28.130" style="s2">level of disturbance that I have caused</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.450" end="01:43:30.770" style="s2">in the universe right so if maybe other</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.130" end="01:43:32.870" style="s2">researchers who didn&#39;t working on the</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.770" end="01:43:35.720" style="s2">lab leak hypothesis had some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.870" end="01:43:38.450" style="s2">computer problems or any other weird</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.720" end="01:43:42.320" style="s2">things happen in their lives maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.450" end="01:43:46.090" style="s2">can share it and we can together some</p>

<p begin="01:43:46.090" end="01:43:54.080" style="s2">outside of the lab leak hypothesis yeah</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.230" end="01:43:55.280" style="s2">I think it&#39;s well worth considering all</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.080" end="01:43:57.500" style="s2">right is there anything that you think</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.280" end="01:43:59.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve missed that needs to be on the</p>

<p begin="01:45:41.850" end="01:45:45.960" style="s2">the scientists they&#39;re not to blame</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.370" end="01:45:49.110" style="s2">because they haven&#39;t been you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.960" end="01:45:49.260" style="s2">engaged in anything illegal or even you</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.110" end="01:45:52.530" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.260" end="01:45:54.660" style="s2">well weapons research is a bit of a gray</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.530" end="01:45:56.490" style="s2">area but dude it&#39;s not illegal for</p>

<p begin="01:45:56.490" end="01:46:01.650" style="s2">and you know China and Russia and all</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.710" end="01:46:03.840" style="s2">being engaged in weapons research the</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.650" end="01:46:06.120" style="s2">thing is like if it escaped and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.840" end="01:46:09.060" style="s2">been a cover-up the people who are doing</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.120" end="01:46:13.400" style="s2">the cover-up they&#39;re the ones who do</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.060" end="01:46:15.630" style="s2">face who should face some ramifications</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.400" end="01:46:19.170" style="s2">but what I think we really need to</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.630" end="01:46:21.619" style="s2">establish is some kind of incentive for</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.170" end="01:46:24.619" style="s2">whistleblowers to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.619" end="01:46:27.860" style="s2">was so safely with immunity and witness</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.619" end="01:46:28.520" style="s2">protection and big financial incentive</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.860" end="01:46:30.980" style="s2">to do so</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.520" end="01:46:33.500" style="s2">yeah and so far I haven&#39;t seen anything</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.980" end="01:46:37.300" style="s2">even remotely on the sword from</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.500" end="01:46:39.679" style="s2">governments which a little odd</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.300" end="01:46:42.739" style="s2">considering you know initially I thought</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.679" end="01:46:45.080" style="s2">you know the American government stance</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.739" end="01:46:47.690" style="s2">was that you know it&#39;s gonna demand a</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.080" end="01:46:50.080" style="s2">full investigation but it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.690" end="01:46:53.210" style="s2">providing financial incentive for</p>

<p begin="01:46:53.210" end="01:46:57.770" style="s2">the things I suggest suggested maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.340" end="01:47:00.679" style="s2">know half jokingly is that maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.770" end="01:47:01.790" style="s2">community can crowd found crowdfund</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.679" end="01:47:05.119" style="s2">something like this to create a</p>

<p begin="01:47:20.420" end="01:47:27.469" style="s2">you know donors of crowd funding to</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.020" end="01:47:30.409" style="s2">collect a bit of a purse to to be able</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.469" end="01:47:32.599" style="s2">to offer these rewards for like</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.409" end="01:47:35.989" style="s2">meaningful amounts for people to be kind</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.599" end="01:47:38.630" style="s2">of risking their livelihood I think this</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.989" end="01:47:41.150" style="s2">is a great idea and the idea of doing it</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.630" end="01:47:43.369" style="s2">with cryptocurrency is a wonderful idea</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.150" end="01:47:48.310" style="s2">to would be a tremendous proof of</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.369" end="01:47:51.820" style="s2">concept about how cryptocurrency could</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.310" end="01:47:55.760" style="s2">function to the benefit of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.820" end="01:48:00.340" style="s2">right it could be and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.760" end="01:48:03.230" style="s2">usually problems of financial incentives</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.340" end="01:48:06.619" style="s2">like if somebody really is in China and</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.230" end="01:48:09.500" style="s2">he wants to or she wants to alert the US</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.619" end="01:48:12.050" style="s2">authorities and be compensated for it</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.500" end="01:48:14.719" style="s2">it&#39;d be really hard to do it and not you</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.050" end="01:48:16.250" style="s2">know get in trouble in China but if</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.719" end="01:48:18.699" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it online through</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.250" end="01:48:22.599" style="s2">cryptocurrency which is you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.699" end="01:48:25.130" style="s2">anonymous and untraceable I think that</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.599" end="01:48:27.349" style="s2">even if it&#39;s not crowdfunding I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.130" end="01:48:29.510" style="s2">you know the American intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.349" end="01:48:33.050" style="s2">agencies should should set up some kind</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.510" end="01:48:35.420" style="s2">of system like that just otherwise the</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.050" end="01:48:38.030" style="s2">risks for people in China to to go</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.420" end="01:48:39.739" style="s2">whistle I think I&#39;m just too great for</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.030" end="01:48:43.280" style="s2">them to do so but if they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.739" end="01:48:46.730" style="s2">can earn some money you know in a very</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.280" end="01:48:48.500" style="s2">safe way I think they&#39;d be much more</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.730" end="01:48:51.199" style="s2">quiet to do so and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.500" end="01:48:53.150" style="s2">necessarily just the scientists whom I</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.199" end="01:48:55.340" style="s2">like we&#39;re working on this who might</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.150" end="01:49:00.380" style="s2">know something it&#39;s probably like they</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.340" end="01:49:04.610" style="s2">had friends family and who can offer you</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.380" end="01:49:08.710" style="s2">no substantive tips on what to look at</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.610" end="01:49:11.510" style="s2">and maybe who who - question for</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.710" end="01:49:13.460" style="s2">investigation to go forward no no no I</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.510" end="01:49:17.949" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s just let&#39;s just let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.460" end="01:49:23.449" style="s2">just say humanity has an overarching</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.949" end="01:49:26.770" style="s2">need to know what took place in order to</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.449" end="01:49:29.449" style="s2">manage what we now are encountering and</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.770" end="01:49:32.179" style="s2">that suggests we should pull out all the</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.449" end="01:49:34.940" style="s2">stops with respect to liberating people</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.179" end="01:49:36.800" style="s2">to tell us what they know and you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.940" end="01:49:38.780" style="s2">people who have the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.800" end="01:49:41.120" style="s2">something that would aid in that effort</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.780" end="01:49:43.310" style="s2">know who they are and they may be more</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.120" end="01:49:45.620" style="s2">creative than you and I are in a</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.310" end="01:49:47.000" style="s2">position to be maybe they can figure out</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.620" end="01:49:48.679" style="s2">some way to make it happen but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.000" end="01:49:53.060" style="s2">figure out where this thing came from</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.679" end="01:49:54.770" style="s2">and if its nature you and I will oh this</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.060" end="01:49:57.770" style="s2">does point something out if it is nature</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.770" end="01:50:00.020" style="s2">with that this came from you and I will</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.770" end="01:50:02.270" style="s2">be relieved to discover it and we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.020" end="01:50:06.679" style="s2">happy to do a follow-up podcast and talk</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.270" end="01:50:08.360" style="s2">about what what the meaning of what</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.679" end="01:50:11.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned is and if it came from the</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.360" end="01:50:16.100" style="s2">lab let&#39;s figure that out last thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.840" end="01:50:19.520" style="s2">before you go I wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.100" end="01:50:23.090" style="s2">I have increasingly noticed in looking</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.520" end="01:50:25.100" style="s2">at all of the sources that claim to put</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.090" end="01:50:29.750" style="s2">the idea of a lab leak to rest</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.100" end="01:50:39.429" style="s2">I find the name Peter - check is that</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.750" end="01:50:42.920" style="s2">right this shows all over the place he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.429" end="01:50:45.980" style="s2">everywhere that the idea is mocked and</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.920" end="01:50:48.080" style="s2">he is the see the president of eco</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.980" end="01:50:49.040" style="s2">Alliance whatever eco Alliance maybe</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.080" end="01:50:53.690" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.040" end="01:50:56.780" style="s2">founder and yes I have comes</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.690" end="01:51:00.310" style="s2">go ahead behind it yeah yeah he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.780" end="01:51:06.920" style="s2">the domain guy who&#39;s been doing this for</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.310" end="01:51:09.890" style="s2">many years very publicly and very large</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.920" end="01:51:12.530" style="s2">amounts of money as like dozens of</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.890" end="01:51:16.280" style="s2">millions of dollars in grant funding</p>

<p begin="01:51:16.280" end="01:51:24.920" style="s2">Department of Defense just funding</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.680" end="01:51:27.320" style="s2">research of essentially going out to</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.920" end="01:51:30.530" style="s2">remote places in nature and collecting</p>

<p begin="01:51:43.370" end="01:51:49.730" style="s2">is I think it&#39;s a pretty futile exercise</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.560" end="01:51:53.630" style="s2">to be able to claim that we can somehow</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.730" end="01:51:56.360" style="s2">predict what in nature can and out of</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.630" end="01:51:59.630" style="s2">the gazillion possibilities which</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.360" end="01:52:02.630" style="s2">mutation will actually jump out from</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.630" end="01:52:06.470" style="s2">nature to to to the human domain just</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.630" end="01:52:08.840" style="s2">because you know I usually what happens</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.470" end="01:52:12.260" style="s2">in nature stays amazing when we actually</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.840" end="01:52:16.160" style="s2">start going out and and probing what you</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.260" end="01:52:19.010" style="s2">know bats carry and in remote places and</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.160" end="01:52:22.850" style="s2">actually bring them all together in one</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.010" end="01:52:23.950" style="s2">spot like in whatever we&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.850" end="01:52:26.300" style="s2">the chances of it actually happening</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.950" end="01:52:30.470" style="s2">well I think I think there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.300" end="01:52:33.140" style="s2">simple comparison to be made right in</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.470" end="01:52:35.690" style="s2">general these things do not jump to</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.140" end="01:52:37.550" style="s2">humans the ones that can general matter</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.690" end="01:52:40.280" style="s2">what Peter claims and he&#39;s making some</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.550" end="01:52:41.810" style="s2">very odd claims of like Oh in Asia it</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.280" end="01:52:45.290" style="s2">happens every day and there&#39;s millions</p>

<p begin="01:52:45.290" end="01:52:52.820" style="s2">he&#39;s making a huge huge jump from like</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.140" end="01:52:55.160" style="s2">extrapolation from just six five farmers</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.820" end="01:52:59.350" style="s2">in Yunnan that had antibodies six out of</p>

<p begin="01:53:06.840" end="01:53:10.530" style="s2">extrapolated to like all the farmers in</p>

<p begin="01:53:29.760" end="01:53:33.510" style="s2">compare what is the risk of a jump</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.189" end="01:53:35.579" style="s2">happening that we didn&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.510" end="01:53:37.229" style="s2">about ahead of time and that if we had</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.579" end="01:53:39.389" style="s2">known about the risk ahead of time we</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.229" end="01:53:41.189" style="s2">could have prepared right so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.389" end="01:53:42.389" style="s2">upside of this research and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.189" end="01:53:44.429" style="s2">the downside which is what are the</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.389" end="01:53:47.280" style="s2">chances that you are going to trigger</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.429" end="01:53:50.159" style="s2">the accidental release of something</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.280" end="01:53:53.099" style="s2">terrible by doing this research which is</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.159" end="01:53:54.959" style="s2">clearly high and so anyway I have come</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.099" end="01:53:57.809" style="s2">to regard this individual and every time</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.959" end="01:54:00.539" style="s2">I see his name show up the information</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.809" end="01:54:03.959" style="s2">does not check out and there&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.539" end="01:54:06.150" style="s2">strong implication that those who even</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.959" end="01:54:09.419" style="s2">consider this hypothesis are telling us</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.150" end="01:54:12.630" style="s2">just how naive and under-informed</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.419" end="01:54:14.039" style="s2">they are which does not match the</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.630" end="01:54:16.979" style="s2">information if you pursue the</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.039" end="01:54:18.989" style="s2">information his assurance of this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.979" end="01:54:22.760" style="s2">always wrong so I have begun to regard</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.989" end="01:54:26.550" style="s2">him as patient zero for misinformation</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.760" end="01:54:30.380" style="s2">well yeah I mean he&#39;s really fighting</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.550" end="01:54:36.059" style="s2">for his life he doesn&#39;t have any other</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.380" end="01:54:39.599" style="s2">way to defend himself if this does turn</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.059" end="01:54:43.079" style="s2">out to be a lab leak ramifications for</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.599" end="01:54:45.570" style="s2">him personally I think just too horrible</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.079" end="01:54:51.209" style="s2">for him to consider to even entertain</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.570" end="01:54:52.409" style="s2">the slightest idea of escape I think you</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.209" end="01:54:54.479" style="s2">I think you&#39;re being I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.409" end="01:54:58.289" style="s2">being too generous the misinformation is</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.479" end="01:55:00.199" style="s2">too egregious and the fact is any decent</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.289" end="01:55:02.519" style="s2">human being would recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.199" end="01:55:05.130" style="s2">humanity&#39;s overarching interest in</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.519" end="01:55:09.539" style="s2">knowing what took place overrides his</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.130" end="01:55:12.269" style="s2">interest in maintaining his reputation</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.539" end="01:55:15.090" style="s2">frankly I think the world would end up</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.269" end="01:55:15.239" style="s2">being decent to a scientist who had made</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.090" end="01:55:17.309" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.239" end="01:55:20.789" style="s2">honest error that had some role to play</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.309" end="01:55:22.380" style="s2">in this thing emerging but I have very</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.789" end="01:55:24.809" style="s2">little sympathy for somebody who would</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.380" end="01:55:26.670" style="s2">hide the truth at expense to others I</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.809" end="01:55:30.480" style="s2">mean people are dying this this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.670" end="01:55:36.380" style="s2">joke this is not something where you get</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.480" end="01:55:39.889" style="s2">to defend your career at the expense of</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.380" end="01:55:43.260" style="s2">tens of thousands of other human beings</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.889" end="01:55:45.749" style="s2">yeah one other point being that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.260" end="01:55:48.269" style="s2">that he just went out and collected so</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.749" end="01:55:50.090" style="s2">many viral strains is that they actually</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.269" end="01:55:53.550" style="s2">had a whole program of synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.090" end="01:55:56.610" style="s2">creating synthetic chimeras to can</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.550" end="01:55:59.429" style="s2">expand the panel of possible first of</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.610" end="01:56:01.860" style="s2">all to predict possible mutations in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.429" end="01:56:03.749" style="s2">wild for some reason that again as I</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.860" end="01:56:06.150" style="s2">said very naive to predict like out of</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.749" end="01:56:09.119" style="s2">gazillion nature of possibilities which</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.150" end="01:56:10.469" style="s2">of them can happen in nature to predict</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.119" end="01:56:12.630" style="s2">them in the lab to create them in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.469" end="01:56:16.079" style="s2">lab and then say that we need to prepare</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.630" end="01:56:18.239" style="s2">for those and yeah in the latest</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.079" end="01:56:19.559" style="s2">interview like before just before they</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.239" end="01:56:21.539" style="s2">were actually in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.559" end="01:56:24.719" style="s2">pandemic in December he gave an</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.539" end="01:56:26.280" style="s2">interview in December of 2019 at some</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.719" end="01:56:27.719" style="s2">viral adji conference where he was</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.280" end="01:56:30.690" style="s2">saying that they had like a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.719" end="01:56:33.989" style="s2">different strains that they were working</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.690" end="01:56:36.480" style="s2">on and how easy it is easy easy it is to</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.989" end="01:56:39.869" style="s2">manipulate current viruses where you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.480" end="01:56:42.630" style="s2">just you know snap out an RBM and put</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.869" end="01:56:45.059" style="s2">one back in and have like different</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.630" end="01:56:47.400" style="s2">tropism between the virus so you can</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.059" end="01:56:48.780" style="s2">study like a more efficient vaccine and</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.400" end="01:56:51.690" style="s2">that was actually the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.780" end="01:56:54.480" style="s2">overarching theme of biology research</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.690" end="01:56:57.050" style="s2">over the past few years to create a fan</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.480" end="01:57:00.809" style="s2">coral virus therap and corona virus</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.050" end="01:57:06.360" style="s2">vaccine whereas so they actually needed</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.809" end="01:57:08.190" style="s2">to provide as wide a panel of</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.360" end="01:57:11.039" style="s2">coronaviruses as possible this is</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.190" end="01:57:12.059" style="s2">actually mentioned in an article by a</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.039" end="01:57:14.249" style="s2">raff barrack</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.059" end="01:57:16.829" style="s2">it&#39;s mentioned in the grant for eco</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.249" end="01:57:20.489" style="s2">health that our needs to do is part of</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.829" end="01:57:22.320" style="s2">that they have a mission to create you</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.489" end="01:57:25.260" style="s2">know many new viral strains against</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.320" end="01:57:28.300" style="s2">which they can test potential therapies</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.260" end="01:57:30.130" style="s2">or vaccines which of course you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.300" end="01:57:32.170" style="s2">haven&#39;t really gotten in time for this</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.130" end="01:57:38.590" style="s2">pandemic but that&#39;s a different question</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.170" end="01:57:41.769" style="s2">yeah well I think that&#39;s a I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.590" end="01:57:44.499" style="s2">a proper a proper note to end on</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.769" end="01:57:48.130" style="s2">I hope that we will discover things in</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.499" end="01:57:52.989" style="s2">the coming weeks that will lead us to</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.130" end="01:57:55.210" style="s2">revise our our best understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.989" end="01:57:58.900" style="s2">what likely has taken place here but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.210" end="01:58:02.949" style="s2">very grateful to you for doing the work</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.900" end="01:58:07.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve done to unearth the evidence of a</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.949" end="01:58:10.150" style="s2">lab leak hypothesis I regard it not only</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.360" end="01:58:13.179" style="s2">as important work but I regard you as</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.150" end="01:58:15.820" style="s2">courageous for having done it and it</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.179" end="01:58:17.889" style="s2">troubles me that people have tried to</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.820" end="01:58:26.349" style="s2">make you feel bad about doing it I hope</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.889" end="01:58:28.090" style="s2">that it&#39;s ultimately internet there are</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.349" end="01:58:31.979" style="s2">some unpleasant things on the Internet</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.090" end="01:58:35.949" style="s2">I wonder why they put them there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.979" end="01:58:39.249" style="s2">all right well you read again thank you</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.949" end="01:58:41.320" style="s2">for for yes you know making this much</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.249" end="01:58:43.360" style="s2">more widespread knowledge that it</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.320" end="01:58:46.929" style="s2">probably would have been without your</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.360" end="01:58:49.749" style="s2">work and and continuing to try to you</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.929" end="01:58:51.429" style="s2">know make people realize that you know</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.749" end="01:58:54.150" style="s2">this is very important and this is</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.429" end="01:58:56.679" style="s2">important matter and we really need</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.150" end="01:58:58.239" style="s2">political support to get to the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.679" end="01:58:59.800" style="s2">of this because you know if it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.239" end="01:59:01.840" style="s2">bunch of people complaining on Twitter</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.800" end="01:59:04.539" style="s2">nobody is going to be pressured into</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.840" end="01:59:06.670" style="s2">having a thorough investigation or if</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.539" end="01:59:09.820" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a lot of people being</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.670" end="01:59:12.219" style="s2">vocal and making their politicians heard</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.820" end="01:59:14.349" style="s2">and making them know that we want you</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.219" end="01:59:16.840" style="s2">know we want the truth we can hand them</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.349" end="01:59:20.889" style="s2">yeah maybe it maybe will get to the</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.840" end="01:59:23.280" style="s2">point of having a really independent and</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.889" end="01:59:26.380" style="s2">true investigation into this</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.280" end="01:59:27.550" style="s2">whistleblowers yeah yeah well one way or</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.380" end="01:59:34.119" style="s2">the other we need to get to the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.550" end="01:59:37.179" style="s2">of it yeah I hope we do okay I will put</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.119" end="01:59:39.340" style="s2">a link to your medium article which I</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.179" end="01:59:39.940" style="s2">think you have added to a couple times</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.340" end="01:59:42.340" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.940" end="01:59:44.410" style="s2">made little edits that you have</p>

<p begin="01:59:44.410" end="01:59:48.790" style="s2">in the original and what you&#39;ve added is</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.210" end="01:59:51.520" style="s2">that correct yeah I had it initially</p>

<p begin="01:59:51.520" end="01:59:57.280" style="s2">couple of points that came out you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.430" end="02:00:05.770" style="s2">I like updated I haven&#39;t really updated</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.280" end="02:00:07.870" style="s2">since well I consider it the hallmark of</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.770" end="02:00:12.220" style="s2">an honest actor is that you know of</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.870" end="02:00:23.140" style="s2">course you release something as hello</p>
