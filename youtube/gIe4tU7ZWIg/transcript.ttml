<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:46.640" style="s2">right i&#39;m always wondering about things</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">and contemplating things and meditating</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.640" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">on things and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">you know cultivate as much as i can</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">or find myself in a state of wonder</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of i had this experience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">almost like everything i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">is running through the frame of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">paper so uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:26.879" style="s2">i&#39;m just about done with that but i</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">wanted just to read</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.879" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">read through it um just to see how it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">all comes together</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">and um notice places that aren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">fluent</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">or that i want to change or um as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">reading it so thank you for tuning in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">and this is just the rough draft of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">of the paper and uh what i&#39;ll do is i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll just read through it and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">probably stop at certain points and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">extrapolate and maybe do it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">like you see in these kind of academic</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">conferences where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">you know somebody gives a talk and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">they read and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">they talk about what they just read and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">then they go on reading something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.239" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna read it here for my computer</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">and here&#39;s the introductory part</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">in this chapter i attempt to look</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:42.319" style="s2">and not just hear logos but rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:44.959" style="s2">following heraclitus listen to logos</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">through listening show logos as</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">and at the same time and by virtue</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">it is also what makes it possible to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">become deaf to logos so in other words i</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">have to rewrite that paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">but basically there&#39;s what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:17.919" style="s2">get at there is there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">in which on one level logos</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.919" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">allows things to appear as the things</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">that they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">right allows me and the light</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">and ideas and thought and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">everything that&#39;s intelligible to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">to reveal themselves and stand out as</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">understandable and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">intelligible yet logos itself never</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">appears as a thing right so i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">to get at that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which it&#39;s very uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very openness it&#39;s very it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">the way that it reveals on some sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">all that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">right is also the way it conceals itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">and so that may account for its enigma</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">right and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">possibly not hear it and i can write a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">paragraph that doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">okay so this is uh i go into a uh</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.320" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">is not listening to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">this disclosure this discloses</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">this i propose sheds light on nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">as the forgetfulness of being as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">as revealing an insight into the logos</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">role in addressing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">when we only hear the speaker but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:12.640" style="s2">the logos his analogies is is an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">to only hearing</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s this parallel where</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">really this really only came about and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">think heraclitus and the pre-socratics</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">were the first ones to conceptualize</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">it was like a big bang of</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">what opened up which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">the the sense in which the being</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i&#39;m referring to and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">trying to get at with this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">logos is the one that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">gathers that you know what you could say</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">gathers the intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">of the being of beings right and without</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s things are still intelligible</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">you can still understand them you can</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">but um but they don&#39;t reveal the sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">of moreness</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">their weirdness their luminosity</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">being as such is disclosed and that</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">right so nothing isn&#39;t denialism right</p>

<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">was the made way for an understanding</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">we have human beings were able to have</p>

<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">out of more mythopoetic thinking which</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.119" style="s2">more of man man&#39;s speech and language</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">really it&#39;s a really interesting</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">so you have</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">for what god said right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">measure of how you knew</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">it was rational how it was true is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">the degree that you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">explain and reveal what was already</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">right in a certain sense and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">man was the creature of god</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">and rationality was in service of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">right so this is kind of interesting</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">right because christianity had this</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">was this point where</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">um was the point of the modern era right</p>

<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">thing to understand with castell is its</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">is its totalizing leveling of literally</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s the thing about gestel right</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:46.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">okay your understanding of being i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.559" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">if you think about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">it&#39;s the understanding upon which the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">background understanding upon which</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:56.559" style="s2">everything is intelligible in the way</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.559" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">right therefore if you change that</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">background understanding of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">going to change</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">everything else how things show up</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">like in how they show up and what what</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:15.599" style="s2">right and so castell is things</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">are no longer subjects and objects</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.599" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">but now in gestel things are standing</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">the human being so everything is</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.119" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">you know and i&#39;ll go on to articulate</p>

<p begin="01:31:49.520" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">about this sense of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.320" end="01:31:57.920" style="s2">that feeds back and i&#39;m fed back into in</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.520" end="01:31:59.600" style="s2">such a way that my contributions reveal</p>

<p begin="01:32:15.920" end="01:32:19.440" style="s2">like in every</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.040" end="01:32:21.600" style="s2">but in where that culminates you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.440" end="01:32:22.880" style="s2">almost say the literal and the symbolic</p>

<p begin="01:32:47.199" end="01:32:52.480" style="s2">all of a sudden the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.400" end="01:32:54.400" style="s2">even if this just happened a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.480" end="01:32:55.920" style="s2">right you could just imagine this like</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.400" end="01:32:56.960" style="s2">where all of a sudden the word is not</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.920" end="01:32:58.719" style="s2">happening just a little bit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.960" end="01:33:00.400" style="s2">happening a lot where the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.719" end="01:33:04.239" style="s2">reality all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.400" end="01:33:07.360" style="s2">no longer requires these relations</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.239" end="01:33:09.280" style="s2">or at least makes them optional</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.360" end="01:33:10.880" style="s2">and by the way those i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.280" end="01:33:12.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve noticed but those relationships</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.880" end="01:33:15.360" style="s2">are a pain</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.000" end="01:33:17.520" style="s2">in the ass right so</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.360" end="01:33:19.679" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing comfortable about them</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.520" end="01:33:21.520" style="s2">um in fact real ones are really</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.679" end="01:33:23.520" style="s2">uncomfortable a lot of times that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.520" end="01:33:25.760" style="s2">makes them real</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.520" end="01:33:27.920" style="s2">so but now that we have an option it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.760" end="01:33:30.400" style="s2">built into the structure of reality in a</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.920" end="01:33:31.920" style="s2">way that it wasn&#39;t before</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.400" end="01:33:33.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the impact of that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.920" end="01:33:35.360" style="s2">what i&#39;m kind of going into</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.760" end="01:33:38.159" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll go into that more and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.360" end="01:33:40.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to go into laying up circling</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.159" end="01:33:42.880" style="s2">and how what circling is which is the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.960" end="01:33:44.239" style="s2">practice of in relationship being with</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.880" end="01:33:47.600" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.239" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">and start to distinguish this as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.600" end="01:33:52.000" style="s2">response to nihilism but also leading</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:55.600" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.000" end="01:33:58.960" style="s2">um dialectic philosophical dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.600" end="01:34:00.800" style="s2">into the ground of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.960" end="01:34:02.719" style="s2">to directly deal with the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.800" end="01:34:06.080" style="s2">reality in discourse</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.719" end="01:34:10.080" style="s2">right what that means and how circling&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.080" end="01:34:10.080" style="s2">revealing this so</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.320" end="01:34:13.679" style="s2">thank you for hanging in there if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:15.520" style="s2">had if you hung in there this long</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.679" end="01:34:17.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve really appreciated the</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.520" end="01:34:19.040" style="s2">opportunity just to</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.520" end="01:34:21.040" style="s2">walk through this i think when i come</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.040" end="01:34:21.600" style="s2">back to this and start writing again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.040" end="01:34:24.000" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.600" end="01:34:25.600" style="s2">do so with much more of a grip on what</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.000" end="01:34:32.400" style="s2">i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.600" end="01:34:32.400" style="s2">or what wants to be said thank you</p>
