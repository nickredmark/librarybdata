<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.259" style="s2">to ask you about that why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:16.509" style="s2">that number one your profiles become so</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.259" end="00:06:18.219" style="s2">big of late and number two why do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.509" end="00:06:20.199" style="s2">think it is that so many members of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.219" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">of the left are so angry about that why</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.199" end="00:06:23.500" style="s2">are they characterizing people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:24.939" style="s2">listen to you as angry and enraged young</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.500" end="00:06:27.129" style="s2">white well we could we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.939" end="00:06:28.539" style="s2">characterization to begin with you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.129" end="00:06:30.819" style="s2">because I think it speaks to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.539" end="00:06:33.339" style="s2">pathology of the radical left instantly</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.819" end="00:06:33.980" style="s2">they&#39;re absolutely incapable of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.339" end="00:06:36.350" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.980" end="00:06:37.850" style="s2">up through group identity terms you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.350" end="00:06:39.560" style="s2">and so if someone comes out and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.850" end="00:06:41.510" style="s2">disagrees with them then they have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.560" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">characterize them by their fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.510" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">group attribute whatever that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">be maybe its gender because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">favorite or maybe it&#39;s race and so angry</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:52.340" style="s2">white men young there we go sexist</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:55.880" style="s2">ageist and racist all at once right</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.340" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">they&#39;re angry young white men well it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.880" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">has to be that way if you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.250" style="s2">the if you&#39;re gonna play the leftist</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:03.050" style="s2">game because that&#39;s the only way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.250" end="00:07:04.300" style="s2">you can look at the world and then if</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.050" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">you can&#39;t make your opponent</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:08.870" style="s2">reprehensible in some manner and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:10.670" style="s2">strange that they would attempt to make</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.870" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">them reprehensible on the grounds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.670" end="00:07:15.530" style="s2">race age and sex since that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:17.210" style="s2">what they stand against hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.530" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">but if you can&#39;t make your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.210" end="00:07:22.070" style="s2">reprehensible along some dimension then</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.650" style="s2">you have to contend with them seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.070" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">and so you know if I&#39;m not an all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.650" end="00:07:28.700" style="s2">fascist like Hitler you know or Milo you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">know Alice which was how I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.700" end="00:07:32.120" style="s2">characterized in Canada because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.220" style="s2">radical leftist can&#39;t even get their</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.120" end="00:07:36.290" style="s2">bloody insults straight he&#39;s like Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.220" end="00:07:37.940" style="s2">or Milo innopolis it&#39;s like because</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.290" end="00:07:40.190" style="s2">there&#39;s no difference between them right</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.940" end="00:07:42.590" style="s2">no obvious difference it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.190" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">attempt to pillory as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.590" end="00:07:47.540" style="s2">and I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s dreadful I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">really think it is there was an article</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.540" end="00:07:51.560" style="s2">written in by the I believe the editor</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:52.850" style="s2">of the New York Review of Books that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.560" end="00:07:55.010" style="s2">just republished in The Globe and Mail</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.850" end="00:07:57.200" style="s2">talking about the emergence of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.010" end="00:07:59.660" style="s2">masculinity and how I was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.200" end="00:08:02.180" style="s2">responsible without or contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.660" end="00:08:03.500" style="s2">it like Mussolini and I read that and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.180" end="00:08:06.230" style="s2">thought yeah like miscellany</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.500" end="00:08:10.640" style="s2">and I thought okay so what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.230" end="00:08:12.380" style="s2">I see you&#39;re you&#39;re defining masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.640" end="00:08:15.170" style="s2">or conflating masculinity and hyper</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.380" end="00:08:17.270" style="s2">masculinity at the same time then your</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.170" end="00:08:19.010" style="s2">virtue signaling by being against hyper</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.270" end="00:08:21.470" style="s2">masculinity but really what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:23.450" style="s2">trying to do is bring down whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.470" end="00:08:25.880" style="s2">is that&#39;s masculinity and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.450" end="00:08:28.280" style="s2">masculinity is in in this frame is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.880" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">something like competence and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.280" end="00:08:32.930" style="s2">part of the radical leftists general war</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:35.090" style="s2">on competence as well which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.930" end="00:08:37.940" style="s2">one of the most pernicious elements of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.090" end="00:08:39.740" style="s2">the culture wars the dissolution of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:42.140" style="s2">hierarchies the the assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.740" end="00:08:44.630" style="s2">every hierarchy has to be based on power</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.140" end="00:08:46.400" style="s2">and served them the needs of your group</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.630" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">whatever that happens to be that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.400" end="00:08:49.550" style="s2">no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.140" style="s2">confidence and so and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.550" end="00:08:54.050" style="s2">thing that&#39;s reprehensible about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.140" end="00:08:55.070" style="s2">because that&#39;s not enough is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.050" end="00:08:58.040" style="s2">just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.070" end="00:08:59.480" style="s2">like there&#39;s I&#39;ve got tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.040" end="00:09:02.180" style="s2">of letters from people and people come</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.480" end="00:09:03.589" style="s2">up to me all the time on the street I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">give you an example this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.589" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">story this is really touching so I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:11.000" style="s2">in LA about a month and a half ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">was downtown LA and downtown LA is kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.000" end="00:09:17.089" style="s2">of rough and I was wandering around and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">with my wife and this young guy pulled a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.089" end="00:09:21.019" style="s2">car up beside hopped out and he was kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:22.579" style="s2">of a stylish looking 21 year old Latino</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.019" end="00:09:24.769" style="s2">guy something like that it was all</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.579" end="00:09:26.750" style="s2">excited he said he asked me who I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.769" end="00:09:28.040" style="s2">and I told him and he you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.750" end="00:09:29.390" style="s2">what he had presumed and so he was kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.040" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">of excited about that he said look I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.390" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">watched all your lectures and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.320" style="s2">really helped me and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:35.089" style="s2">straightening out my life and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.320" end="00:09:36.829" style="s2">get my room clean and he laughed about</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.089" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">that but you know developing some aims</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.829" end="00:09:39.829" style="s2">and trying to tell the truth and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:42.050" style="s2">look I&#39;ve really fixed up my</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.829" end="00:09:43.579" style="s2">relationship with my father and so then</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.050" end="00:09:45.950" style="s2">he said wait wait just wait a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.579" end="00:09:48.019" style="s2">I thought sure what sure so he went back</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.950" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">in the car and he got his farther out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.019" end="00:09:50.899" style="s2">his car and he came over with his dad</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:52.130" style="s2">like they had their arms around each</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.899" end="00:09:53.690" style="s2">other and he said look we&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.130" end="00:09:56.500" style="s2">improved our relationship and they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.690" end="00:09:58.970" style="s2">both smiling away and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.500" end="00:10:00.709" style="s2">man if you&#39;re gonna target me for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.970" end="00:10:02.510" style="s2">just go right ahead and as a real white</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.709" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">supremacist oh yeah yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.510" end="00:10:07.010" style="s2">wherever I go now and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:09.050" style="s2">things this is the thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.010" end="00:10:10.760" style="s2">wonderful about that all of this as far</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.050" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned is that people come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.760" end="00:10:15.230" style="s2">to me all the time and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:19.339" style="s2">what they say they say look I was lost</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.230" end="00:10:20.510" style="s2">aimless depressed nihilistic anxious</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">drug-addicted</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.510" end="00:10:25.699" style="s2">alcoholic wasting my time masturbating</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:28.510" style="s2">too much although they don&#39;t generally</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.699" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">use that particular example you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.510" end="00:10:34.490" style="s2">loss essentially and and and hopeless in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:36.110" style="s2">some sense and I&#39;ve been watching your</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.490" end="00:10:37.130" style="s2">lectures and they&#39;ve really helped and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.110" end="00:10:38.329" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been putting my life</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.130" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">together and I&#39;ve been trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.329" end="00:10:42.980" style="s2">what I believe to be true and develop a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:45.709" style="s2">vision and it&#39;s really helped and like</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.980" end="00:10:47.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s so overwhelming you know like</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.709" end="00:10:50.870" style="s2">if I&#39;m doing book signings after a talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.690" end="00:10:54.140" style="s2">then there&#39;ll be a dozen people or more</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.870" end="00:10:56.149" style="s2">who and these aren&#39;t like I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.140" end="00:10:57.890" style="s2">talking to people for about 15 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.149" end="00:11:00.440" style="s2">but you can have a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.890" end="00:11:01.230" style="s2">conversation in 15 seconds and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.440" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">say look you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.230" end="00:11:04.530" style="s2">like I was suicidal man like I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.180" style="s2">really hanging on to the edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.530" end="00:11:09.330" style="s2">earth by my fingernails</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.180" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m better and they have tears in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.330" end="00:11:13.560" style="s2">their eyes it&#39;s like it&#39;s amazing little</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:16.200" style="s2">of that goes a long way well I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:18.930" style="s2">that when I look at your eyes and look I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.200" end="00:11:20.670" style="s2">talk to people who love what you do I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.930" end="00:11:22.470" style="s2">mean every time I go on the road and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.670" end="00:11:24.270" style="s2">speaking at a campus you&#39;re the number</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:25.950" style="s2">one name that gets mentioned and people</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.270" end="00:11:27.480" style="s2">would buy people who come to my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.950" end="00:11:29.130" style="s2">and I think that the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.480" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">that I&#39;ve that I&#39;ve seen is is really</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.130" end="00:11:33.060" style="s2">twofold one is that one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:35.340" style="s2">that you really talk a lot about is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.060" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">notion of self discipline and purpose in</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.340" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">your life and control and the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:39.060" style="s2">you are in control of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:40.950" style="s2">decision-making and your decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.060" end="00:11:43.020" style="s2">matters that&#39;s one and the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.950" end="00:11:45.750" style="s2">reserves you have you have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.020" end="00:11:47.430" style="s2">capacity to say no to things and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.750" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">somebody says something to you that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.430" end="00:11:50.400" style="s2">it illogical but popular then you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:51.660" style="s2">the capacity to say no that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.400" end="00:11:53.220" style="s2">happen in that Kathy Newman interview</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.660" end="00:11:54.540" style="s2">that then somebody was saying something</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.220" end="00:11:56.700" style="s2">to you the made no sense and you just</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.540" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">said well no and then you just stood on</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.700" end="00:11:59.670" style="s2">that now and when you stand on that no I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.350" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">think it gives people a lot of courage</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.670" end="00:12:04.920" style="s2">yeah well I mean the gender issue is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:07.650" style="s2">really an interesting one because one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.920" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">my professional domains of expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.650" end="00:12:12.060" style="s2">individual differences I&#39;m a personality</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">psychologist and so I know the gender</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.060" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">difference literature and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:19.910" style="s2">very solid literature well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">it&#39;s very solid it has a 30-year history</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.910" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">once per psychologist got the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">personality models down so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">the big five model all empirically</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:30.300" style="s2">derived straight statistics right brute</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:32.430" style="s2">force empiricism nobody had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.300" end="00:12:35.070" style="s2">theoretical axe to grind with the big</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.430" end="00:12:37.380" style="s2">five except to say maybe there are human</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.070" end="00:12:39.510" style="s2">traits maybe they&#39;re encapsulated in</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.380" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">language we can use statistical</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.510" end="00:12:42.630" style="s2">techniques to find out what they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">that was it that is the whole ideology</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.630" end="00:12:47.730" style="s2">so very very neutral as far as</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:50.790" style="s2">ideologies go five traits emerge okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.730" end="00:12:53.160" style="s2">are there differences between the sexes</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.790" end="00:12:54.930" style="s2">turns out there are all right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.160" end="00:12:57.030" style="s2">not massive although if you sum them</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.930" end="00:12:59.130" style="s2">across all the traits you can separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.030" end="00:13:01.080" style="s2">men and women with about 75 percent</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.130" end="00:13:02.940" style="s2">accuracy so it&#39;s not trivial but you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.080" end="00:13:04.950" style="s2">have to sum across all the traits then</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.940" end="00:13:07.280" style="s2">another question comes up well are those</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.950" end="00:13:10.260" style="s2">differences socio-cultural or</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.280" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">biologically ok we can test that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.260" end="00:13:13.950" style="s2">go around the world we&#39;ll look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">cultures will rank order them in terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.950" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:19.890" style="s2">gender equality of their sociological</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.280" end="00:13:21.180" style="s2">policies we can do that with broad</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.890" end="00:13:24.900" style="s2">agreement from the right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.180" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">then the hypothesis would be if gender</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.900" end="00:13:29.670" style="s2">differences decrease among more</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:31.470" style="s2">egalitarian societies then the gender</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.670" end="00:13:34.050" style="s2">differences our socio-cultural or at</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.470" end="00:13:36.060" style="s2">least more socio-cultural that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.050" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">the opposite of what was found</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.060" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">repeatedly that&#39;s pseudoscience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:43.560" style="s2">like no that&#39;s mainstream psychology</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:46.020" style="s2">those papers have thousands of citations</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.560" end="00:13:48.600" style="s2">and right the average humanities paper</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.020" end="00:13:51.030" style="s2">has zero citations right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.600" end="00:13:52.590" style="s2">next most common one has one three</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.030" end="00:13:55.170" style="s2">thousand that&#39;s an that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.590" end="00:13:56.640" style="s2">unbelievable classic and and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.170" end="00:13:58.170" style="s2">other bit of proofs like you say well</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.640" end="00:14:00.990" style="s2">how do you know that you can trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.170" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">someone&#39;s judgement about a fact the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.990" end="00:14:06.660" style="s2">fact emerges despite their ideological</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:09.180" style="s2">presuppositions okay so it&#39;s well-known</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.660" end="00:14:12.120" style="s2">that the social sciences and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:14.130" style="s2">humanities have a have a left tilt and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.120" end="00:14:15.990" style="s2">lot of that&#39;s temperamental and the tilt</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.130" end="00:14:17.940" style="s2">has become more pronounced but as</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.990" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">Jonathan Hyde has pointed out there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.940" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">no conservatives among social</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:24.870" style="s2">personality psychologists or none to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">speak of yes very few vanishingly</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.870" end="00:14:30.420" style="s2">feeling and if the field has a bias it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:32.640" style="s2">is definitely and indisputably a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.420" end="00:14:34.140" style="s2">left-wing bias okay so you have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.640" end="00:14:35.340" style="s2">that if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.140" end="00:14:36.660" style="s2">right even if you&#39;re a left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.340" end="00:14:38.460" style="s2">scientist you have to fight that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.660" end="00:14:40.890" style="s2">you want to get to the facts it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.460" end="00:14:42.570" style="s2">these social scientists he generated the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.890" end="00:14:44.460" style="s2">data that suggested that the gender</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.570" end="00:14:46.260" style="s2">differences not only were real but that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.460" end="00:14:48.630" style="s2">were bigger in egalitarian societies</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.260" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">they didn&#39;t do that to grind their</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.630" end="00:14:53.340" style="s2">ideological axe because their</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">ideological presupposition was no no you</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.340" end="00:14:57.450" style="s2">make the society you yell at Aryan men</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:01.290" style="s2">and women get more the same it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.450" end="00:15:03.000" style="s2">they get more different Oh booth isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.290" end="00:15:05.430" style="s2">that something and so then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.000" end="00:15:07.500" style="s2">corollary there which is all right you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.430" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">could still say and they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.500" end="00:15:12.660" style="s2">pushing in this direction in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:13.560" style="s2">boys and girls are different men and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.660" end="00:15:16.590" style="s2">women are different</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:19.140" style="s2">it looks biological but because people</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.590" end="00:15:21.450" style="s2">are malleable you could push the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.140" end="00:15:23.820" style="s2">socio-cultural structure harder and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.450" end="00:15:25.710" style="s2">harder to minimize the biological</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.820" end="00:15:26.830" style="s2">differences okay well first of all maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.710" end="00:15:28.450" style="s2">and maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;d get a rebound and they&#39;d get even</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.450" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">like the kids would rebel that could</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.690" style="s2">easily happen but let&#39;s say okay you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:39.190" style="s2">could the problem with that is is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.690" end="00:15:41.320" style="s2">if you seed that much power to the state</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.190" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">like you&#39;re basically giving the state</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.320" end="00:15:47.470" style="s2">the right to socialize your kids rights</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:49.030" style="s2">like you you really you really you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.470" end="00:15:50.530" style="s2">really want to do that I mean the people</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.030" end="00:15:52.840" style="s2">in Israel couldn&#39;t do that with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.530" end="00:15:54.310" style="s2">kabuto right it didn&#39;t work so people</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.840" end="00:15:55.990" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna give up their children to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.310" end="00:15:57.430" style="s2">the state and thank God for that well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.990" end="00:15:58.660" style="s2">mean this is one of the big questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.430" end="00:16:00.220" style="s2">that we were discussing earlier is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.660" end="00:16:01.780" style="s2">we were talking about the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.220" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">in politics between right and left and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.780" end="00:16:06.610" style="s2">obviously you&#39;re you&#39;re a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">you&#39;re a philosopher but you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.610" end="00:16:09.940" style="s2">dragged almost kicking and screaming</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:11.710" style="s2">into this political sphere because</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.940" end="00:16:13.720" style="s2">everything has been so politicized and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.710" end="00:16:14.830" style="s2">so when you say when you cite social</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.720" end="00:16:17.050" style="s2">science statistics and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.830" end="00:16:18.430" style="s2">scientifically based you&#39;re called a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.050" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">racist you&#39;re called the sexist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.430" end="00:16:23.890" style="s2">called the homophobe and exactly so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:25.510" style="s2">why is it that so why do you think it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.890" end="00:16:27.520" style="s2">that so many folks on the Left who</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.510" end="00:16:29.710" style="s2">purport to be all about reason and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.520" end="00:16:31.830" style="s2">science and an objective fact are so</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.710" end="00:16:33.970" style="s2">willing to throw those out the window</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.830" end="00:16:36.250" style="s2">the minute that it becomes politically</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:38.860" style="s2">inconvenient well because you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.250" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">that cognitive system so an</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.860" end="00:16:45.070" style="s2">interpretation of the world has levels</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:47.110" style="s2">there axiomatic levels some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.070" end="00:16:49.480" style="s2">presuppositions are more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.110" end="00:16:51.820" style="s2">than others and you could say well the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.480" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">leftists historically maybe because of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.820" end="00:16:56.020" style="s2">their atheistic rationality are more on</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:16:59.140" style="s2">the side of science than say the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.020" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">fundamental isms of any sort but when</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.140" end="00:17:05.560" style="s2">push comes to shove you find out how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:08.530" style="s2">axioms are are nested there&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.560" end="00:17:11.380" style="s2">axioms underneath that which is that all</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.530" end="00:17:13.930" style="s2">hierarchies are based on power and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.380" end="00:17:16.330" style="s2">power plays are based on group identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.930" end="00:17:18.280" style="s2">tribal identity essentially and that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.330" end="00:17:20.500" style="s2">entire history of the world is nothing</p>

<p begin="00:17:20.500" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">different identity groups it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.240" end="00:17:27.490" style="s2">well if the science indicates that some</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.530" style="s2">of that&#39;s wrong then do you alter those</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.490" end="00:17:31.210" style="s2">beliefs or do you alter the science and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.530" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">the answer to that question is well it</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.210" end="00:17:34.870" style="s2">depends on how you&#39;ve hierarchically</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:37.720" style="s2">arranged those if the science is at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.870" end="00:17:39.640" style="s2">bottom then you alter your beliefs right</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.720" end="00:17:40.889" style="s2">if it&#39;s the scientific facts or the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.640" end="00:17:43.299" style="s2">axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.889" end="00:17:45.220" style="s2">some structure then you then you alter</p>

<p begin="00:17:45.220" end="00:17:48.789" style="s2">axiomatic sub structure then you alter</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.230" end="00:17:51.070" style="s2">the science well we&#39;ve seen how that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.789" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">plays out and one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.070" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">tried to do so to speak is to diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:58.019" style="s2">the axiomatic structure it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:18:00.190" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the metaphysical</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.190" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">left well what it is is you&#39;re basically</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:11.320" style="s2">engaged in warfare right and the warfare</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.679" end="00:18:14.379" style="s2">is arbitrary except insofar as it serves</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.320" end="00:18:16.179" style="s2">your group okay I don&#39;t buy any of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.379" end="00:18:18.190" style="s2">I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a route to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.179" end="00:18:20.470" style="s2">certain disaster I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.190" end="00:18:23.409" style="s2">degeneration into tribalism and that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.470" end="00:18:25.389" style="s2">will seriously pay for it not only</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.409" end="00:18:27.369" style="s2">because it returns us to tribalism and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.389" end="00:18:30.460" style="s2">tribes fight as the anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.369" end="00:18:32.110" style="s2">evidence for that is overwhelming right</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.460" end="00:18:33.909" style="s2">tribes fight it doesn&#39;t even matter if</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.110" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">they&#39;re chimpanzee tribes even</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.909" end="00:18:41.490" style="s2">chimpanzee tribes fight so not only do</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:44.019" style="s2">you regress to a tribalism but you also</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.490" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">invalidate the one proposition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.019" end="00:18:48.249" style="s2">being able to help us arise above the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.600" end="00:18:50.619" style="s2">tribal which is the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.249" end="00:18:53.740" style="s2">individual should be sovereign and so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.619" end="00:18:56.289" style="s2">think the culture war is about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.740" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">the proper framework within which to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.289" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">view human identity and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:05.019" style="s2">relationship between the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:07.389" style="s2">the group in relationship to that I did</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.019" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">and the leftist answer is it&#39;s all group</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.389" end="00:19:12.100" style="s2">and it&#39;s all power it&#39;s like okay so in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:14.470" style="s2">just a second I want to ask you a little</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.180" end="00:22:48.020" style="s2">Enlightenment and it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.160" end="00:22:50.210" style="s2">because like if you look at the typical</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.020" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">academic psychologists say their</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.210" end="00:22:54.740" style="s2">historical knowledge generally runs back</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.400" end="00:22:56.420" style="s2">about 15 years and so because they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.740" end="00:22:57.710" style="s2">all concerned with the with the modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.420" end="00:22:59.660" style="s2">literature and there&#39;s some utility in</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.710" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">that but that the downside is they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.660" end="00:23:03.140" style="s2">have any historical context so you read</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:05.630" style="s2">someone like Taylor and you think wow</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.140" end="00:23:07.850" style="s2">he&#39;s stretching it back 500 years you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.630" end="00:23:09.740" style="s2">know but there&#39;s there&#39;s reading that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.850" end="00:23:11.870" style="s2">goes way beyond that to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.740" end="00:23:14.180" style="s2">sources of the cells and the source of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.870" end="00:23:16.760" style="s2">the modern ethos and this is a huge bone</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.180" end="00:23:18.740" style="s2">of contention between people like me say</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.760" end="00:23:20.270" style="s2">and people like Harris and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.740" end="00:23:22.940" style="s2">between people like you and people like</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.270" end="00:23:25.310" style="s2">Harris is that my sense is that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.940" end="00:23:27.590" style="s2">Enlightenment values themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.310" end="00:23:30.230" style="s2">grounded in an ethos that&#39;s much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.590" end="00:23:33.740" style="s2">and much less articulated and that would</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.230" end="00:23:38.120" style="s2">be an ethos of metaphor image drama</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.120" end="00:23:43.030" style="s2">dance even without matter the nonverbal</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.970" end="00:23:44.750" style="s2">the the pattern recognition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.030" end="00:23:46.670" style="s2">McGilchrist has written a book called</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:48.560" style="s2">the master and his emissary which lays</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.670" end="00:23:50.510" style="s2">that out quite night nicely with regards</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.560" end="00:23:52.940" style="s2">to hemispheric specialization it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.510" end="00:23:54.920" style="s2">of predicated on Alcoa and Goldberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.940" end="00:23:56.990" style="s2">observation that the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.920" end="00:23:58.700" style="s2">specialized for what we know and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.990" end="00:24:00.500" style="s2">right hemisphere is specialized for what</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.700" end="00:24:03.830" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an order chaos</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.500" end="00:24:05.930" style="s2">dynamic and the rough idea would be that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.830" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">the left hemisphere generates paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.930" end="00:24:09.710" style="s2">attic systems so that would be like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">Enlightenment system actually imprinted</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.710" end="00:24:15.410" style="s2">right even stainable axiom predicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">but that that entire EXCI ematic system</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.410" end="00:24:19.270" style="s2">is based in a non verbal in the non</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:22.150" style="s2">verbal domain</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.270" end="00:24:23.830" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with while it would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.150" end="00:24:25.809" style="s2">associated with the right hemisphere but</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.830" end="00:24:28.420" style="s2">would also be associated with deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.809" end="00:24:32.350" style="s2">motivations biological motivations and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:34.090" style="s2">emotions and so because here&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.350" end="00:24:36.309" style="s2">of looking at it you think well how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.090" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">you validate an axiomatic system of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:39.700" style="s2">ethics and the answer is quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:41.640" style="s2">straightforward Jean Piaget figured this</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.700" end="00:24:43.870" style="s2">out is you play it out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.640" end="00:24:45.790" style="s2">literally you acted out in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.870" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">then you watch each other&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.790" end="00:24:50.170" style="s2">responses and if the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:53.559" style="s2">playing out is the axiomatic system that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.170" end="00:24:55.300" style="s2">you&#39;re playing out satisfies the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.559" end="00:24:57.160" style="s2">motivations and the emotions of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.300" end="00:24:59.530" style="s2">people who are engaged in that system</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.160" end="00:25:01.030" style="s2">then the system is justified and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.530" end="00:25:02.950" style="s2">you say well it&#39;s not just that their</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.030" end="00:25:05.290" style="s2">motivations and emotions are satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.950" end="00:25:06.700" style="s2">it&#39;s more complex it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.290" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">motivations and emotions of each</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.700" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">individual are satisfied but not only</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.190" end="00:25:14.980" style="s2">now but now next week next month and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.640" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">next year so you have to stay extended</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.980" end="00:25:21.880" style="s2">across time and not only my emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:23.830" style="s2">motivations but yours as well now next</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.880" end="00:25:24.940" style="s2">week next month and across time so</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.830" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s terribly tight</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.940" end="00:25:31.059" style="s2">constraints the or placed upon an hour</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">an axiomatic systems validity now the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.059" end="00:25:34.510" style="s2">way Jean Piaget thought of that he said</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">well think about it like a child&#39;s game</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.510" end="00:25:39.820" style="s2">a bunch of kids get together and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:42.760" style="s2">decide to play pretend okay and pretend</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.820" end="00:25:45.250" style="s2">is let&#39;s Mortal the world right and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.760" end="00:25:47.020" style="s2">as a place to act because to pretend you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.250" end="00:25:49.809" style="s2">ever go right so the kids get together</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.020" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">and they assign rules and they say well</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.809" end="00:25:53.020" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be mom you&#39;re gonna be dead</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:56.710" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be the dog and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.020" end="00:25:59.530" style="s2">play house and then they they act it out</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.710" end="00:26:01.690" style="s2">and what they&#39;re doing is seeing if they</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.530" end="00:26:04.030" style="s2">can regulate the manner in which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.690" end="00:26:06.040" style="s2">constructing the game so that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.030" end="00:26:08.740" style="s2">emotions and motivations are so well</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.040" end="00:26:11.110" style="s2">satisfied that they want to continue the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.740" end="00:26:13.300" style="s2">game okay and so that&#39;s so cool so what</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.110" end="00:26:16.300" style="s2">it shows you is that&#39;s how an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.300" end="00:26:17.559" style="s2">system is is tested and justified it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.300" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">like you play it out and you see if</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.559" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">everyone wants to keep playing and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:24.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different methodology</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.820" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">than the scientific domain right so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.190" end="00:26:29.140" style="s2">axiomatic system isn&#39;t the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">axiomatic system isn&#39;t justified by</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.140" end="00:26:32.890" style="s2">reference to the scientific method it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:33.220" style="s2">justified by reference to the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.890" end="00:26:36.030" style="s2">and mo</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.220" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">wellbeing of all the players of the game</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.030" end="00:26:41.580" style="s2">now that game he merges this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:44.500" style="s2">second part of this and this is so cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.580" end="00:26:47.620" style="s2">then the question is well how does that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.500" end="00:26:49.960" style="s2">game emerge and the answer is the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.620" end="00:26:52.210" style="s2">way that children&#39;s games emerges</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.960" end="00:26:54.190" style="s2">so what Piaget noted is that kids would</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.210" end="00:26:56.350" style="s2">get together and they&#39;d play marbles and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.190" end="00:26:58.030" style="s2">if they were young kids they could all</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.350" end="00:26:59.740" style="s2">play marbles say six six years old they</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.030" end="00:27:00.730" style="s2">could all play marbles and and if they</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.740" end="00:27:02.010" style="s2">were in a group they were playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.730" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">marbles and it all worked out fine</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.010" end="00:27:07.030" style="s2">squabbles no you know the kids would</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:08.620" style="s2">keep playing right validating the games</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.030" end="00:27:09.790" style="s2">but if you took the kids out of the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.620" end="00:27:11.620" style="s2">and you said what are the rules of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.790" end="00:27:13.810" style="s2">game they would give completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.620" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">disparate account so they knew how to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.810" end="00:27:18.700" style="s2">it it was like the wisdom was in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:20.200" style="s2">group mm-hmm the wisdom was fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.700" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">enough among the individuals so if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.200" end="00:27:22.780" style="s2">pulled the individuals out they&#39;d give</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">disparate accounts but if you put them</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.780" end="00:27:26.350" style="s2">all together they could play the game</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.950" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">but then if you waited till they were 11</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.350" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">or 12 and you pulled them out of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:33.400" style="s2">game then they could tell you the rules</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">then at 14 or 15 they they would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.400" end="00:27:37.210" style="s2">willing to this is with more</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.860" end="00:27:39.250" style="s2">sophisticated games they would be more</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:41.740" style="s2">willing to regard themselves as makers</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:44.940" style="s2">of the rules okay so here&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.740" end="00:27:47.290" style="s2">happens in an evolutionary sense people</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.940" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">going all the way back to our primate</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.290" end="00:27:51.850" style="s2">forebears organize themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:53.560" style="s2">functional hierarchies okay and now the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.850" end="00:27:55.420" style="s2">hierarchies are complex and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.560" end="00:27:58.150" style="s2">just based on power despite what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.420" end="00:28:00.970" style="s2">idiot Marxists say even do all has noted</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.150" end="00:28:02.950" style="s2">that chimpanzee hierarchies are unstable</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.970" end="00:28:04.660" style="s2">if they&#39;re only based on power they</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.950" end="00:28:07.930" style="s2">don&#39;t last they need to generate into</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.660" end="00:28:11.800" style="s2">violence so you have a hierarchy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.930" end="00:28:13.570" style="s2">that works but it&#39;s acted out no one</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.800" end="00:28:16.300" style="s2">knows why it works it works because</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.570" end="00:28:17.680" style="s2">everyone seems to be happy with it okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.300" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">and so those hierarchies get more</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.680" end="00:28:21.550" style="s2">complex and more sophisticated and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">people start to observe them and talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.550" end="00:28:25.450" style="s2">about them it&#39;s like well we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:27.550" style="s2">hierarchy here what&#39;s it like and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.450" end="00:28:29.050" style="s2">they spin off dramas about the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.550" end="00:28:30.490" style="s2">here&#39;s a hero who climbed up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.050" end="00:28:32.500" style="s2">hierarchy and here&#39;s what a hero looks</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.490" end="00:28:34.990" style="s2">like okay so then you get the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.500" end="00:28:36.520" style="s2">hierarchy and then you get the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.990" end="00:28:39.400" style="s2">the hero as the person who moves up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.520" end="00:28:41.650" style="s2">hierarchy and generates it okay then out</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.400" end="00:28:43.750" style="s2">of that you get the extraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.650" end="00:28:45.940" style="s2">idea of the hero and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.750" end="00:28:46.600" style="s2">development of that idea and it&#39;s out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.940" end="00:28:48.820" style="s2">that you get</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.600" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">the monotheistic religions and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.820" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">like the procedure and the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">come first no one knows what the rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:57.490" style="s2">are it&#39;s all played out the same way</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:59.530" style="s2">that wolves play it out in a pack or</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.490" end="00:29:01.510" style="s2">chimpanzees play it out in a troop then</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.530" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">we wake up and think oh we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.510" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">structure here&#39;s the structure that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">would be Osiris in the Egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:09.640" style="s2">mythologies here&#39;s the structure here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.169" style="s2">how the structure goes wrong here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.640" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">the structure does here&#39;s it&#39;s tearing</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.169" end="00:29:15.190" style="s2">at tyrannical aspect here&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.080" style="s2">have to do to generate the structure and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.190" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">to thrive in it okay that&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.080" end="00:29:20.380" style="s2">important the hierarchy is important</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:22.360" style="s2">enough but what we want to know is how</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.380" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">to master the hierarchy okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.360" end="00:29:25.390" style="s2">where you get the mythologies of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:27.490" style="s2">hero okay and then so then this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.390" end="00:29:28.870" style="s2">generates all sorts of different heroes</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:31.179" style="s2">because there&#39;s different ways of him</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.870" end="00:29:33.429" style="s2">being successful then you have a panoply</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.179" end="00:29:36.510" style="s2">of heroes then you think okay well now</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.429" end="00:29:39.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all those heroes that&#39;s a set</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.510" end="00:29:42.250" style="s2">we can move pull back and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.340" end="00:29:44.890" style="s2">something about all these heroes is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.250" end="00:29:47.230" style="s2">makes them heroes that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.890" end="00:29:49.240" style="s2">extract out the monotheistic Savior</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.230" end="00:29:51.250" style="s2">because that&#39;s why in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.240" end="00:29:53.080" style="s2">Christ is the king of kings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.250" end="00:29:55.480" style="s2">actually you can think about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.080" end="00:29:57.789" style="s2">literal statement for forget about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.480" end="00:29:59.500" style="s2">religious overlay it&#39;s like okay you got</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.789" end="00:30:01.809" style="s2">a bunch of people some of them are kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.500" end="00:30:03.700" style="s2">of King like okay so you admire them</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.809" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like for whatever reason that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.700" end="00:30:07.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to figure out why you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:08.919" style="s2">admire someone right that&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.000" end="00:30:10.659" style="s2">but let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got admire</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.919" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">admirable people you start telling</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.659" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">stories about them that&#39;s why you go to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:16.600" style="s2">a movie you want to watch someone you</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:18.520" style="s2">don&#39;t care about your board by know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.600" end="00:30:20.260" style="s2">want to go watch someone admirable and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.520" end="00:30:21.460" style="s2">interesting or maybe the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.260" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">that but doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.460" end="00:30:25.299" style="s2">thing then you think okay well we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:27.370" style="s2">all these admirable people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.299" end="00:30:29.049" style="s2">generating the world properly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.370" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">what makes them admirable there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.049" end="00:30:34.179" style="s2">principle they embody and that principle</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:37.059" style="s2">is the process by which the admirable</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.179" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">world is generated that&#39;s the logos okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.059" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s operative at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:41.530" style="s2">beginning of time so here&#39;s my so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:43.330" style="s2">my question about about all this because</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.530" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">now we&#39;re really not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.330" end="00:30:45.789" style="s2">twelve rules for life as much as maps</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:48.820" style="s2">meaning which is your first book which</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.789" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">are you&#39;re doing me the audio it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.820" end="00:30:52.179" style="s2">definitely a harder book than twelve</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:53.770" style="s2">rules for life in a much more complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.179" end="00:30:55.659" style="s2">book in a lot of ways than twelve rules</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.770" end="00:30:57.190" style="s2">for life so how universal are these</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.659" end="00:30:58.750" style="s2">systems meaning why is it that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.190" end="00:31:00.280" style="s2">Enlightenment only arrives at one time</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.750" end="00:31:01.870" style="s2">in human history in one place in human</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.280" end="00:31:04.630" style="s2">history as opposed to if human biology</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.870" end="00:31:06.550" style="s2">is essentially consistent across you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.630" end="00:31:09.700" style="s2">know across humanity then why is it that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.550" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">that you know if at the at the apex of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.700" end="00:31:12.550" style="s2">the levels you have the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.410" style="s2">idea which is started this particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.550" end="00:31:16.090" style="s2">question then why is it that it only</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.410" end="00:31:18.250" style="s2">arrives in one place at one time as</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.090" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">opposed to arriving in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.250" end="00:31:22.270" style="s2">places in a rack right it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.820" style="s2">crystal that&#39;s okay the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.270" end="00:31:28.450" style="s2">would say is the process by which this</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.820" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">the hierarchy itself and success within</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.450" end="00:31:33.610" style="s2">the hierarchy is generated that&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:35.410" style="s2">accounted over millions of years at</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.610" end="00:31:36.790" style="s2">least hundreds thousands of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.410" end="00:31:39.310" style="s2">years but I would push it back because</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.790" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">you can see analogs in the chimps so 20</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.310" end="00:31:44.800" style="s2">million years let&#39;s say that&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">time on that time scale the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.800" end="00:31:49.870" style="s2">the enlightenment values arose in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.730" style="s2">500 years ago before anywhere else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.870" end="00:31:55.240" style="s2">like well who cares it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.730" end="00:31:57.280" style="s2">old men long right if you put five 100</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.240" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">year old men in line it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.280" end="00:32:03.460" style="s2">yesterday it&#39;s this morning so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:05.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved these hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.460" end="00:32:07.990" style="s2">structures that&#39;s our culture we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.890" end="00:32:09.220" style="s2">evolved ways of maneuvering within the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.990" end="00:32:11.590" style="s2">hierarchical structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.220" end="00:32:13.800" style="s2">successful and now we&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.590" end="00:32:17.680" style="s2">evolve ways of mapping our our</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.800" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">adaptation not just adapting but mapping</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.680" end="00:32:26.770" style="s2">it okay so how does the mapping occur</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:28.840" style="s2">first admiration second imitation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.770" end="00:32:31.330" style="s2">admiration and that would be drama</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.840" end="00:32:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you dramatize Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.330" end="00:32:35.260" style="s2">extracts out what&#39;s admirable and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.040" end="00:32:36.610" style="s2">interesting and plays it out so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.260" end="00:32:38.500" style="s2">the use of the body as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.610" end="00:32:41.050" style="s2">representational structure of the body</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.500" end="00:32:42.340" style="s2">so we act out what&#39;s admirable you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.050" end="00:32:43.930" style="s2">okay now we&#39;ve kind of got the drama</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.340" end="00:32:45.700" style="s2">down we&#39;re all captured by this drama</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.930" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like well then the literary critics</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.700" end="00:32:49.780" style="s2">come along the Philosopher&#39;s and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:52.360" style="s2">say oh what are the principles by which</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.780" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">the admirable people operate it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.360" end="00:32:55.380" style="s2">chimps woke up and said oh well some</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:58.180" style="s2">chimps are more successful than others</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.380" end="00:32:59.680" style="s2">what are the rules of success it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.180" end="00:33:01.180" style="s2">well there were no rules because they</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.680" end="00:33:03.370" style="s2">weren&#39;t running by rules right</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.180" end="00:33:05.830" style="s2">there aren&#39;t rules until you describe</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.370" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">the patterns then you have a rule okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.830" end="00:33:09.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens with Moses by the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:11.350" style="s2">women right Moses has a revelation</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.010" end="00:33:13.330" style="s2">here&#39;s the rules right yeah we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.350" end="00:33:13.910" style="s2">living out those rules forever yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.330" end="00:33:15.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.910" end="00:33:18.410" style="s2">because they weren&#39;t rules they were</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.560" end="00:33:21.560" style="s2">customs right okay so you start by</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.410" end="00:33:23.690" style="s2">mapping your customs in drama and story</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.560" end="00:33:25.610" style="s2">and that way you can represent them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.690" end="00:33:28.130" style="s2">you can transmit them then once you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.610" end="00:33:30.560" style="s2">them in your grip say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.130" end="00:33:32.840" style="s2">represented now not just acted out well</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.560" end="00:33:35.300" style="s2">then you can move one step backwards</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.840" end="00:33:36.860" style="s2">from them and you can say well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.300" end="00:33:38.660" style="s2">the commonalities among these what are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.860" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">the general principles that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.660" end="00:33:42.650" style="s2">development of something like the code</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">of hammurabi right it&#39;s like well we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.650" end="00:33:47.030" style="s2">got all these customs what are they</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:49.370" style="s2">right revelation it&#39;s like oh here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.030" end="00:33:52.610" style="s2">you map the customs that&#39;s the Decalogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.370" end="00:33:56.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the same idea so I took human</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.610" end="00:33:58.760" style="s2">beings a very long time to evolve their</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.060" end="00:34:01.400" style="s2">hierarchies to evolve their structures</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.760" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">of success and then to have enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.400" end="00:34:06.740" style="s2">people around with enough spare time to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:09.860" style="s2">engage in the cultural process of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.740" end="00:34:12.140" style="s2">artistic cultural process of mapping the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.860" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">adaptive structure that only merges in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.140" end="00:34:16.310" style="s2">mythology and drama then that lays the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:18.169" style="s2">groundwork for philosophy then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.310" end="00:34:19.220" style="s2">philosophers could come in especially</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.169" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">once it&#39;s written like in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.220" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">judeo-christian pantheon it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:26.030" style="s2">now we&#39;ve got it written down oh well we</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:27.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have to remember it right we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.030" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">read it and while we&#39;re reading we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.860" end="00:34:32.870" style="s2">think about it and so then out of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:34.790" style="s2">starts to come the semantic codes well</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.870" end="00:34:36.530" style="s2">then you get the Enlightenment it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.790" end="00:34:38.270" style="s2">oh well here&#39;s a bunch of semantic codes</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.530" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yeah those are great so</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.270" end="00:34:41.360" style="s2">this is really interesting because you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">know if you read Pinker or three eternal</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.360" end="00:34:45.140" style="s2">Goldberg&#39;s new book essentially they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:46.850" style="s2">attribute the the enlightenment to Jonah</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.140" end="00:34:48.230" style="s2">Goldberg calls it the miracle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.850" end="00:34:49.340" style="s2">almost as though it accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.230" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">occurred in a certain place in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.340" end="00:34:52.580" style="s2">time John doesn&#39;t quite go quite that</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">far I think to be fair to him but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.580" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">think that that philosophy that this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:35:00.920" style="s2">sort of sprang up randomly here is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:02.270" style="s2">very much embedded in a lot of sam</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.920" end="00:35:04.310" style="s2">harris is thinking a lot of Premier&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.270" end="00:35:06.620" style="s2">thinking and you&#39;re taking it further</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.310" end="00:35:08.420" style="s2">back but I do wonder if this may be</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.620" end="00:35:10.940" style="s2">nariyal disagree with us it should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.420" end="00:35:14.510" style="s2">fun are you attributing the growth of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.940" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">the judeo-christian ethic that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.510" end="00:35:17.690" style="s2">into the Enlightenment as also</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.340" style="s2">accidental you&#39;re just pushing a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.690" end="00:35:20.420" style="s2">timeline for their back bay oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:22.460" style="s2">think it&#39;s accidental</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.420" end="00:35:24.710" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not making a reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.460" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">argument so the first thing is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.710" end="00:35:30.109" style="s2">to say this is how religion evolved</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:32.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m not saying that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.109" end="00:35:34.550" style="s2">explanation exhausts the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.690" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very strange phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.550" end="00:35:38.329" style="s2">it was very very strange but but that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t generate a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.329" end="00:35:43.099" style="s2">plausible evolutionary account it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:46.190" style="s2">if you have a bunch of motivated</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.099" end="00:35:48.349" style="s2">emotional limited beings occupying the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.190" end="00:35:50.680" style="s2">same territory and competing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.349" end="00:35:53.480" style="s2">cooperating for the same resources</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.680" end="00:35:55.339" style="s2">including the resource of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.480" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">which can generate more resources is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.339" end="00:36:00.890" style="s2">a zero-sum game there are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">patterns of adaptation that emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.890" end="00:36:05.660" style="s2">that that are similar so here&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:08.210" style="s2">thinking about it if you put a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.660" end="00:36:10.460" style="s2">kids together they&#39;re gonna evolve games</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.210" end="00:36:12.109" style="s2">right well which games well a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.460" end="00:36:15.230" style="s2">different games yeah but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.109" end="00:36:17.420" style="s2">games right so even though so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.230" end="00:36:19.339" style="s2">moral relativist element a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.420" end="00:36:20.990" style="s2">different games okay but the moral</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.339" end="00:36:22.940" style="s2">absolutist element is yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.990" end="00:36:25.940" style="s2">they&#39;re all games and the games have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.940" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">be playable which means they have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.940" end="00:36:30.410" style="s2">continue right in an iterated way right</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:32.869" style="s2">so that&#39;s a big constraint people have</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.410" end="00:36:35.869" style="s2">to want to play them so not only do they</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.869" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">have to be games no and comprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.869" end="00:36:39.380" style="s2">to everybody and enjoyable but people</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">but they have to be self maintaining and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.380" end="00:36:44.869" style="s2">everyone has has to want to play them</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:47.210" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the answer to the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.869" end="00:36:49.430" style="s2">conundrum a plethora of potential</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.210" end="00:36:53.020" style="s2">ethical implications of the world an</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.430" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">infinite variety yeah okay fine</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.020" end="00:36:59.329" style="s2">not an infinite variety of pragmatically</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:01.849" style="s2">applicable interpretations you instantly</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.329" end="00:37:04.339" style="s2">constrain the universe - Walter - what</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.849" end="00:37:06.650" style="s2">well this is why there&#39;s commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.339" end="00:37:08.150" style="s2">in mythologies is like if you put enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.650" end="00:37:11.720" style="s2">people together in enough different</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.150" end="00:37:13.609" style="s2">places the commonality of the groups of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.720" end="00:37:15.470" style="s2">people they&#39;re because of the grounding</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.609" end="00:37:17.900" style="s2">and common motivation and emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.470" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2">embodiment because were embodied means</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.900" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">that they&#39;re gonna generate hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:24.920" style="s2">that are broadly similar with strategies</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.619" style="s2">of success within those hierarchies that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.920" end="00:37:29.150" style="s2">are broadly similar with descriptions of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.619" end="00:37:31.790" style="s2">the strategies that are broadly similar</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.150" end="00:37:33.319" style="s2">and so you could say in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.790" end="00:37:35.930" style="s2">ethic that gave rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.319" end="00:37:38.630" style="s2">Enlightenment is in place more or less</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.930" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">everywhere now it&#39;s tricky because not</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.630" end="00:37:42.050" style="s2">every hierarchical system is as</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:43.610" style="s2">functional as every</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.050" end="00:37:45.530" style="s2">other hierarchical system some of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.610" end="00:37:47.600" style="s2">can degenerate into tyranny we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.530" end="00:37:49.670" style="s2">talking about the set of all voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.600" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">playable games right or something like</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.670" end="00:37:53.540" style="s2">that and that can degenerate out of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get common hero myths you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.540" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">have to and then and that not lays the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:37:59.720" style="s2">groundwork that lays the groundwork for</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:02.150" style="s2">even our ability to communicate right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.720" end="00:38:04.130" style="s2">right so this is the Enlightenment guys</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.150" end="00:38:06.080" style="s2">they just they&#39;re not getting that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.130" end="00:38:07.490" style="s2">and this gets to I think the broader</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.080" end="00:38:09.140" style="s2">question that I know you and Sam went on</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.490" end="00:38:11.060" style="s2">for three hours about about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.140" end="00:38:12.230" style="s2">of truth because particularly truth in</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.060" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">the moral sphere I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.230" end="00:38:15.740" style="s2">I&#39;m would be fair to say that you guys</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:17.480" style="s2">agree on the idea of truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.740" end="00:38:19.160" style="s2">scientific sphere that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.480" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">something is that there is such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.160" end="00:38:23.870" style="s2">as objective truth or are you I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:26.060" style="s2">say we agree on a lot of that that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.870" end="00:38:27.980" style="s2">question is to some degree why do</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.060" end="00:38:30.890" style="s2">scientists accept the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.980" end="00:38:32.930" style="s2">objective truth is true and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.890" end="00:38:34.670" style="s2">say we probably don&#39;t agree about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.930" end="00:38:36.770" style="s2">because I would ground that in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.670" end="00:38:38.780" style="s2">pragmatism right and Sam would ground</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.770" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">out in the idea of an independently</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.780" end="00:38:42.590" style="s2">existing objective world right which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:44.150" style="s2">a leap of faith more like my own</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.590" end="00:38:45.470" style="s2">actually than the pragmatist view right</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.150" end="00:38:46.610" style="s2">no and if you believe that there&#39;s a god</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.470" end="00:38:48.110" style="s2">who&#39;s out there in the universe who</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.610" end="00:38:50.360" style="s2">created the structures in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.110" end="00:38:52.130" style="s2">certain way then what he created is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.360" end="00:38:53.240" style="s2">truth and it is apart from you that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.130" end="00:38:54.530" style="s2">human beings didn&#39;t exist and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.240" end="00:38:55.550" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to utilize the truth that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.530" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">truth would still exist out there</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.550" end="00:38:59.720" style="s2">whereas the pragmatism I&#39;d say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:39:01.700" style="s2">truth is in the use that it has for you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.720" end="00:39:03.230" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly that&#39;s the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.700" end="00:39:06.350" style="s2">that you know I don&#39;t know if we would</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.230" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">consider scientific truth true unless we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.350" end="00:39:11.090" style="s2">are also simultaneously accepting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:13.460" style="s2">idea that scientific truth is good for</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.090" end="00:39:15.050" style="s2">people so there&#39;s one other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.460" end="00:39:16.880" style="s2">wanted to bring up that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.050" end="00:39:19.120" style="s2">because you brought up the idea of God</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.880" end="00:39:21.470" style="s2">so here&#39;s a way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.120" end="00:39:23.090" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what to make of this</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.470" end="00:39:24.950" style="s2">because this is stretching me this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.090" end="00:39:27.020" style="s2">stretching my thoughts out beyond where</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.950" end="00:39:29.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to develop them so this</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.020" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">is the intuition that I have based on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.090" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">variety of things experiences I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:37.670" style="s2">so imagine that there&#39;s a very wide</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:40.160" style="s2">range of human behaviors okay and some</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:42.200" style="s2">subset of those are both admirable and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.160" end="00:39:44.710" style="s2">not admirable so let&#39;s call them good</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.200" end="00:39:47.750" style="s2">and evil at this at the extremes okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.710" end="00:39:50.270" style="s2">then we might say well there&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.750" end="00:39:51.890" style="s2">that characterizes all the actions that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.270" end="00:39:53.360" style="s2">are good and a pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.890" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">characterizes all the actions that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.360" end="00:39:57.740" style="s2">evil and that&#39;s a transpersonal pad</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:59.660" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just about you or me</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.740" end="00:40:00.890" style="s2">it&#39;s about everyone okay and so then</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.660" end="00:40:02.600" style="s2">that gets persona</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.890" end="00:40:03.800" style="s2">that&#39;s Christ and Satan let&#39;s say or</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.600" end="00:40:05.869" style="s2">Cain and Abel right that gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.800" end="00:40:07.460" style="s2">personified and that&#39;s a bad guy and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.869" end="00:40:08.990" style="s2">good guy in a movie like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.460" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">personified all the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.990" end="00:40:13.730" style="s2">it&#39;s Thor and Loki you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">Marvel movies you know so now you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.730" end="00:40:17.270" style="s2">the alleged state you take the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:20.170" style="s2">Christ and you think okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.270" end="00:40:23.210" style="s2">abstraction of everything that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.170" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">admirably good about the set of all</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.210" end="00:40:27.650" style="s2">human behaviors okay and then you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:30.290" style="s2">well what sort of reality does that have</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.650" end="00:40:32.060" style="s2">and this Bissman pulls back into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.290" end="00:40:34.850" style="s2">reality of the idea of the logos and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.060" end="00:40:36.520" style="s2">idea that it was the logos that God used</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.850" end="00:40:39.859" style="s2">at the beginning of time to extract</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.520" end="00:40:42.920" style="s2">order out of chaos so you think well</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.859" end="00:40:45.800" style="s2">it&#39;s transpersonal the goodness because</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.920" end="00:40:48.109" style="s2">it&#39;s not just characterized stick of any</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.800" end="00:40:50.359" style="s2">one person it&#39;s more like something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.109" end="00:40:52.520" style="s2">inhabits a person rather than that a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.359" end="00:40:53.840" style="s2">person is you can really see this for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.520" end="00:40:55.970" style="s2">example on the other end - with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.840" end="00:40:58.400" style="s2">satanic end because if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.970" end="00:41:00.680" style="s2">writings of people who do absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.400" end="00:41:02.210" style="s2">horrific things like the shooters you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.680" end="00:41:04.190" style="s2">can see that possession and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.210" end="00:41:06.260" style="s2">extraordinarily clearly if your eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.190" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">open it&#39;s like and it&#39;s shocking so</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.260" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">people don&#39;t usually look at it and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:11.900" style="s2">even say that themselves like that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:13.220" style="s2">Columbine kids their writings are</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.900" end="00:41:16.730" style="s2">hair-raising you know and they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.220" end="00:41:19.970" style="s2">clearly possessed by an evil that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.730" end="00:41:22.460" style="s2">only encounter if you sit in a dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.970" end="00:41:25.160" style="s2">place and brood on your hatred for</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.460" end="00:41:28.460" style="s2">months and years right you go places</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.160" end="00:41:31.430" style="s2">that you go places where all the dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.460" end="00:41:34.700" style="s2">people go right right and then that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.430" end="00:41:36.350" style="s2">that takes you over okay so the good can</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.700" end="00:41:39.050" style="s2">take you over as well okay so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.350" end="00:41:41.630" style="s2">this there&#39;s the spirit of good let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.050" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">say and what the spirit of good does is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.630" end="00:41:46.730" style="s2">act in the world on the potential of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:48.740" style="s2">world to generate the actuality of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.730" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">world and the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.740" end="00:41:53.090" style="s2">proposition is is that if you confront</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:56.690" style="s2">the potential of the world with good in</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.090" end="00:41:59.690" style="s2">mind using truth truthful communication</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.690" end="00:42:02.420" style="s2">then the order that you extract is good</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:04.700" style="s2">and then that&#39;s echoed in Genesis when</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.420" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">God is using the word and he creates</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.700" end="00:42:08.600" style="s2">cosmos out of potential and every time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:09.770" style="s2">he does that he says and it was good</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.600" end="00:42:11.120" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.770" end="00:42:12.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s so interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.120" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a proposition there in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.950" end="00:42:16.220" style="s2">proposition there is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:19.250" style="s2">encounter potential with truth the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.220" end="00:42:21.350" style="s2">cosmos you create is actually good well</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.250" end="00:42:23.660" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s just an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.350" end="00:42:25.610" style="s2">overwhelming idea it&#39;s like if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.660" end="00:42:27.950" style="s2">if it&#39;s true it&#39;s the greatest idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.610" end="00:42:29.300" style="s2">there ever was ya know your your</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.950" end="00:42:31.220" style="s2">thoughts on this actually from maps of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.300" end="00:42:32.750" style="s2">meaning helped generate what we in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.220" end="00:42:35.660" style="s2">injuries in clubs of our torah in hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.750" end="00:42:39.020" style="s2">leading they thought about that about</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.660" end="00:42:40.850" style="s2">the the bible but it this merged with a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.020" end="00:42:42.410" style="s2">little bit versus italian thought led me</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.850" end="00:42:44.600" style="s2">to the idea that when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.410" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">mystical notion of the tree of good and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.600" end="00:42:49.010" style="s2">evil in eden what is that supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:50.300" style="s2">what did what did people do wrong by</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.010" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">eating from the tree of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.300" end="00:42:54.290" style="s2">and my feeling is that what they did</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">wrong is that god created a universe in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.290" end="00:42:57.740" style="s2">which the value was embedded in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:42:59.450" style="s2">object right that in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.740" end="00:43:01.940" style="s2">you in your in your book talk about if</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.450" end="00:43:03.830" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching a child about an object</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.940" end="00:43:05.330" style="s2">the rules of the object are embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.830" end="00:43:06.650" style="s2">the teaching about the object so you use</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.330" end="00:43:08.600" style="s2">the example of a vase we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.650" end="00:43:10.340" style="s2">this earlier but you use the example of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.600" end="00:43:11.540" style="s2">a vase where you teach a child don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.340" end="00:43:13.340" style="s2">touch the vase because the base will</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.540" end="00:43:15.050" style="s2">break so that the rule is embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.340" end="00:43:16.550" style="s2">the object in the same way in a wrist</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.050" end="00:43:18.230" style="s2">italian thought the rules for behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.550" end="00:43:18.770" style="s2">are embedded in the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.230" end="00:43:20.630" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.770" end="00:43:22.370" style="s2">meaning what makes a man good is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.630" end="00:43:24.140" style="s2">makes a man unique which is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.370" end="00:43:25.820" style="s2">they they it is the reason is what makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.140" end="00:43:27.530" style="s2">man unique so acting in accordance with</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.820" end="00:43:28.850" style="s2">right reason is what makes something is</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.530" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">what makes an action good so if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.850" end="00:43:32.180" style="s2">believe that God created the universe</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:34.430" style="s2">along these lines and that what natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.180" end="00:43:36.470" style="s2">law is is just the human attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.430" end="00:43:38.780" style="s2">understand the lines along which created</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.470" end="00:43:40.250" style="s2">God created the universe then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.780" end="00:43:42.920" style="s2">human beings went wrong is when they</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.250" end="00:43:44.750" style="s2">decided to separate values from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.920" end="00:43:46.220" style="s2">universe when we decided to take values</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.750" end="00:43:47.960" style="s2">and say this is a completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.220" end="00:43:50.090" style="s2">thing so this base has no rules attached</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.960" end="00:43:52.130" style="s2">to it anymore it&#39;s just a vase and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.090" end="00:43:54.110" style="s2">can construct the rules arbitrarily as</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.130" end="00:43:55.610" style="s2">to what to do with this base and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.110" end="00:43:58.250" style="s2">eating from the tree of knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.610" end="00:44:00.530" style="s2">good and evil changes the nature of good</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.250" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">and evil from the universe comes along</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.530" end="00:44:03.950" style="s2">with a set of rules to human beings</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:06.530" style="s2">think that they can use their own</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.950" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">intuition to supplant God&#39;s rules and to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.530" end="00:44:09.800" style="s2">supplant universal rules with their own</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:10.910" style="s2">particular vision of what the universe</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.800" end="00:44:12.470" style="s2">ought to be and at that point they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.910" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">to be expelled yeah well okay okay so</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.470" end="00:44:16.730" style="s2">that&#39;s also associated to some degree I</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">would say with Milton&#39;s warning and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.730" end="00:44:21.110" style="s2">paradise laws because Milton basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:22.810" style="s2">portrays Lucifer who&#39;s the bringer of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.110" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">light weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.810" end="00:44:27.610" style="s2">as the spirit of unbridled rationality</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2">which accounts for to say the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.610" end="00:44:31.960" style="s2">Church antagonism the Catholic Church&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.950" end="00:44:33.970" style="s2">antagonism towards rationality the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.960" end="00:44:36.790" style="s2">was same idea and the Tower of Babel</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.970" end="00:44:40.690" style="s2">that human beings have a proclivity to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.790" end="00:44:43.060" style="s2">erect their own dogmatic ethical systems</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.690" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">and then to expand them into a</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.470" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">thee with the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.180" end="00:45:08.560" style="s2">while you&#39;re making some headway towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:11.020" style="s2">towards sorting that out I mean there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.560" end="00:45:13.990" style="s2">a cataclysm that&#39;s that&#39;s explained in</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.020" end="00:45:16.630" style="s2">in in the story of Adam and Eve right</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.990" end="00:45:19.360" style="s2">the Cataclysm is the coming two to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.630" end="00:45:21.340" style="s2">wakefulness and its associated partly</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.360" end="00:45:22.780" style="s2">with recognition of nakedness which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.340" end="00:45:24.700" style="s2">recognition of vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.780" end="00:45:26.740" style="s2">mortality and the discovery of death and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.700" end="00:45:28.600" style="s2">then also the discovery of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.740" end="00:45:31.240" style="s2">that goes along with that so you said</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.600" end="00:45:33.910" style="s2">well that&#39;s partly the the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.240" end="00:45:36.010" style="s2">division of ethics from the facts of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.910" end="00:45:37.750" style="s2">object so I have to think that through I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.010" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">would also recommend to people I think I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.750" end="00:45:41.020" style="s2">mentioned this before is in McGilchrist</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:42.250" style="s2">book that the master in his emissary</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.020" end="00:45:44.410" style="s2">because he looks at this</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.250" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">neuropsychological right and and looks</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.410" end="00:45:47.890" style="s2">at the the left hemisphere as the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:50.680" style="s2">hemisphere that&#39;s dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.890" end="00:45:52.510" style="s2">explicitly axiomatic systems and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.680" end="00:45:56.260" style="s2">right hemisphere that&#39;s dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.510" end="00:45:58.360" style="s2">what those systems are embodied in okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.260" end="00:46:00.280" style="s2">so part of what happens with with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.360" end="00:46:01.690" style="s2">emergence of good and evil is as far as</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.280" end="00:46:03.970" style="s2">I could tell it took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.690" end="00:46:06.250" style="s2">think about this is that and this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.970" end="00:46:07.570" style="s2">different than the than the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.250" end="00:46:09.430" style="s2">that you laid forward which is why I</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.570" end="00:46:12.280" style="s2">can&#39;t reconcile them exactly yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.430" end="00:46:14.950" style="s2">you recognize you&#39;re naked you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.280" end="00:46:17.490" style="s2">can be hurt you know you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.950" end="00:46:19.450" style="s2">and insufficient you hide from God</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.490" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">because that&#39;s what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.450" end="00:46:24.130" style="s2">and the reason you hide from God say God</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:26.200" style="s2">is your destiny or God is the you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.130" end="00:46:28.510" style="s2">walking with God is a manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.200" end="00:46:30.250" style="s2">your ultimate proper destiny you you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.510" end="00:46:32.170" style="s2">doubt whether you&#39;re capable of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.250" end="00:46:33.880" style="s2">because now you realize you&#39;re embodied</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">finitude your nakedness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.880" end="00:46:38.890" style="s2">insufficiency so you hide in your</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:41.020" style="s2">shame so there&#39;s that you also realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.890" end="00:46:42.760" style="s2">that you can be hurt and suffer and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.020" end="00:46:44.049" style="s2">kind of goes along with God&#39;s command</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.760" end="00:46:45.220" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to work in the sweat</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.049" end="00:46:46.839" style="s2">of your brow and that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:49.089" style="s2">die and that women are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.839" end="00:46:51.490" style="s2">subjugated to men which is put on as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.089" end="00:46:53.890" style="s2">curse not as a moral imperative right</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.490" end="00:46:56.140" style="s2">right um but then what emerges out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.890" end="00:46:58.569" style="s2">that is that as soon as you you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.140" end="00:47:00.940" style="s2">that you can be hurt this is what</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.569" end="00:47:02.619" style="s2">differentiates us from animals and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:04.450" style="s2">really think that through here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.619" end="00:47:06.250" style="s2">myriad ways I can be hurt then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.450" end="00:47:08.049" style="s2">angry about that because you can be hurt</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.250" end="00:47:10.569" style="s2">but even worse you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.049" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">hurt other people and and so that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.569" end="00:47:14.589" style="s2">of that knowledge of good and evil you</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:17.740" style="s2">associated with this dissociation of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.589" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">of the object from its ethical container</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.740" end="00:47:20.920" style="s2">right now the universe has created by</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">God from our interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.920" end="00:47:24.549" style="s2">universe that there is a gap between the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:27.700" style="s2">two and that once human beings begin to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.549" end="00:47:30.520" style="s2">supplant their own rationality for a TOS</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.700" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">right in the or cecelio G you know we</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.520" end="00:47:34.839" style="s2">end up doing is creating all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.520" style="s2">awful systems that end up destroying us</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.839" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">in the other stuff but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.520" end="00:47:40.270" style="s2">about that that&#39;s right I mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:42.700" style="s2">what happens in the New Testament as far</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.270" end="00:47:45.099" style="s2">as I can tell is that what Christ says</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.700" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">so he&#39;s trying to transcend the rule</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.099" end="00:47:48.339" style="s2">structure right not because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.140" style="s2">anything wrong with the rules they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.339" end="00:47:51.460" style="s2">necessary preconditions for discipline</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.140" end="00:47:53.500" style="s2">which is actually why I wrote twelve</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.460" end="00:47:55.510" style="s2">rules right it&#39;s like you need rules but</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.500" end="00:47:57.250" style="s2">they&#39;re but rules conflict and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.510" end="00:47:59.290" style="s2">don&#39;t always apply and so there has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.250" end="00:48:00.819" style="s2">be an ethic underlying the rules and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.290" end="00:48:03.339" style="s2">should have more respect for the ethic</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.819" end="00:48:05.140" style="s2">than for the rules right okay Christ&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.339" end="00:48:07.630" style="s2">idea and this is part of the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.140" end="00:48:09.849" style="s2">reestablishment of paradise is that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.630" end="00:48:11.829" style="s2">should orient yourself towards the good</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.849" end="00:48:13.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s something like an alliance</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.829" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">with God and then that you should tell</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.780" end="00:48:17.589" style="s2">the truth and that&#39;s that&#39;s the ethic</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:19.720" style="s2">that generated the rules to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.589" end="00:48:22.180" style="s2">okay and then we could be serious about</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.720" end="00:48:23.799" style="s2">this you know and we could say well how</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.180" end="00:48:25.720" style="s2">do you adjudicate the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.799" end="00:48:27.579" style="s2">claim alright so then we might think</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:31.030" style="s2">we&#39;re we already walked through the fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.579" end="00:48:33.430" style="s2">that the heroes of the past acted on</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.030" end="00:48:34.990" style="s2">potential to extract out the world of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.430" end="00:48:36.609" style="s2">actuality and if they did that properly</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.990" end="00:48:39.160" style="s2">then the world they extracted was good</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.609" end="00:48:42.040" style="s2">and that that is a divine principle and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.160" end="00:48:44.710" style="s2">then we might say well is it a divine</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.040" end="00:48:46.990" style="s2">principle and you might say well what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.710" end="00:48:48.180" style="s2">it that&#39;s acting through people in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.990" end="00:48:49.980" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.180" end="00:48:51.750" style="s2">the Christian theological answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.980" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">would be the logos right right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.750" end="00:48:55.079" style="s2">the idea that&#39;s the idea of the holy</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:56.700" style="s2">spirit roughly speaking right might</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.079" end="00:48:59.609" style="s2">think well is that a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.700" end="00:49:02.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like well to me it&#39;s real the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.609" end="00:49:04.440" style="s2">way that consciousness is real and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.550" end="00:49:06.809" style="s2">don&#39;t know the role of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.440" end="00:49:08.520" style="s2">determining reality even but even if</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.809" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">you&#39;re an evolutionary biologist and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.520" end="00:49:12.290" style="s2">this is so interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:14.579" style="s2">evolutionary biologists actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.290" end="00:49:16.589" style="s2">discriminate differentiated themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.579" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">from Darwin on this point like Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.589" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">was very very forthright in his claim</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:23.940" style="s2">that sexual selection was as powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.839" end="00:49:25.950" style="s2">natural selection or even more so and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.940" end="00:49:27.990" style="s2">that so here&#39;s where this that goes and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.950" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">and because that was because that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.990" end="00:49:31.859" style="s2">brought consciousness into the world as</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:33.690" style="s2">an active player the materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.859" end="00:49:35.880" style="s2">evolutionary biologist ignored that for</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.690" end="00:49:37.619" style="s2">like 150 years and only concentrated on</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.880" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">natural selection where they could play</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.619" end="00:49:43.170" style="s2">well this is all chance right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:45.569" style="s2">sexual selection is not chance okay so</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.170" end="00:49:47.329" style="s2">here&#39;s a hypothesis human being</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.569" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">separated themselves from chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.329" end="00:49:51.750" style="s2">one of the reasons they did that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">because human females are sexually</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.750" end="00:49:55.980" style="s2">selective chimps aren&#39;t chimps will</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.150" end="00:49:59.309" style="s2">female chimps in estrus will mate with</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.980" end="00:50:01.380" style="s2">any chimp the Maine chimps the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.309" end="00:50:03.540" style="s2">ones chased the subordinate males away</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.380" end="00:50:05.010" style="s2">so they&#39;re more likely to have offspring</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.540" end="00:50:07.619" style="s2">but it&#39;s not because of female choice</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.010" end="00:50:09.089" style="s2">right now female human females have done</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.619" end="00:50:12.049" style="s2">this whole different thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.089" end="00:50:15.210" style="s2">they&#39;ve they&#39;ve they have hidden</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.049" end="00:50:18.690" style="s2">fertility and they&#39;re much more likely</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.210" end="00:50:21.119" style="s2">to go after guys who have climbed up the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.690" end="00:50:22.770" style="s2">hierarchy so let&#39;s say heroes will give</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:24.329" style="s2">the women some credit for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.770" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">right and say that that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.329" end="00:50:26.430" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:28.530" style="s2">even if they&#39;re using wealth and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.430" end="00:50:29.940" style="s2">forth and status as a marker they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.530" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">actually using those as a marker for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.940" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">competence standed yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.920" end="00:50:35.490" style="s2">that&#39;s I think yeah I think the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">for that is clear okay so you might say</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.490" end="00:50:41.609" style="s2">oh well it was human female conscious</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:43.380" style="s2">choice that selected us mm-hmm okay and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.609" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">you think well that&#39;s not random that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.380" end="00:50:46.710" style="s2">not random at all it&#39;s the farthest</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:48.270" style="s2">thing from random that there is and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.710" end="00:50:50.069" style="s2">means consciousness is making its</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.270" end="00:50:51.960" style="s2">choices with regards to what propagates</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.069" end="00:50:54.630" style="s2">but then it&#39;s even more complex than</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.960" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">that so here&#39;s what happens among men</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.630" end="00:51:00.630" style="s2">the men all get together in their</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">hierarchy they positive valued goal they</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.630" end="00:51:03.010" style="s2">all accept that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:04.570" style="s2">the goal because otherwise they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.010" end="00:51:06.280" style="s2">be cooperating right then they arranged</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.570" end="00:51:08.440" style="s2">themselves into a hierarchy and they let</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.280" end="00:51:09.880" style="s2">the most confident guys lead because</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.440" end="00:51:11.170" style="s2">they want to get to they want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.880" end="00:51:14.740" style="s2">the promised land they want to get it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.170" end="00:51:17.800" style="s2">the most competent leaders leading Rea</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.740" end="00:51:20.410" style="s2">competent defined by that value okay so</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.800" end="00:51:22.150" style="s2">here&#39;s what happens essentially the men</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.410" end="00:51:22.630" style="s2">all get together and vote on the good</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.150" end="00:51:26.380" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.630" end="00:51:27.910" style="s2">and the good man are then chosen by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.380" end="00:51:30.970" style="s2">women and those are the people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.910" end="00:51:33.670" style="s2">propagate and so it&#39;s like men are</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.970" end="00:51:36.070" style="s2">voting on which men get to reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.670" end="00:51:37.990" style="s2">women are going along with the vote</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.070" end="00:51:39.670" style="s2">and-and-and being even more stringent in</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.990" end="00:51:41.350" style="s2">their in their choices let&#39;s say and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.670" end="00:51:43.840" style="s2">then what you get is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.350" end="00:51:46.359" style="s2">consciousness that through its active</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.840" end="00:51:49.570" style="s2">expression transforms the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.359" end="00:51:53.260" style="s2">the world into actuality also selects</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.570" end="00:51:56.380" style="s2">the direction of evolution right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.260" end="00:51:59.619" style="s2">that&#39;s where the meme darkens term turns</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.380" end="00:52:01.180" style="s2">into the biological reality it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.619" end="00:52:02.740" style="s2">it yeah this is something that&#39;s so cool</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.180" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">about Dawkins it&#39;s like I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.740" end="00:52:06.850" style="s2">thought this about Dawkins is if he</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.420" end="00:52:09.250" style="s2">would push his thinking to the limits he</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.850" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">would fall right into young well and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.250" end="00:52:13.420" style="s2">then he&#39;d be lost that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:15.670" style="s2">universe but if you think that mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.420" end="00:52:17.740" style="s2">seriously like and I mean really</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.670" end="00:52:21.210" style="s2">seriously think yeah there&#39;s some ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.740" end="00:52:24.760" style="s2">of conceptualizing that becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.210" end="00:52:26.290" style="s2">all-encompassing yeah that&#39;s right they</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.760" end="00:52:28.510" style="s2">start to become an actual force of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.290" end="00:52:31.320" style="s2">evolution itself and so then here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.510" end="00:52:33.880" style="s2">case you could make consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.320" end="00:52:35.830" style="s2">extracts the proper world of being from</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.880" end="00:52:40.300" style="s2">potential through truth and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.830" end="00:52:42.850" style="s2">good this way okay that&#39;s our hard one</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.300" end="00:52:44.619" style="s2">man that manifests itself in human</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.850" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">beings at the individual level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.619" end="00:52:47.260" style="s2">individual consciousness that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:50.140" style="s2">logos within</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.260" end="00:52:51.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the metaphysical foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.140" end="00:52:53.890" style="s2">the idea of natural right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.490" end="00:52:56.440" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s a bloody killer</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.890" end="00:52:59.650" style="s2">idea that&#39;s expressed in the hero of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.440" end="00:53:02.740" style="s2">Heroes that idea that hero of Heroes is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.650" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">the driving force behind human evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.740" end="00:53:07.900" style="s2">so not only do you get the action of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">logos metaphysically as the process that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.900" end="00:53:11.320" style="s2">extracts order out of chaos at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:13.540" style="s2">beginning of time you also get it as the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">major driver of evolution and so then</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.540" end="00:53:17.110" style="s2">you&#39;ll ask okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">then what kind of reality does that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.110" end="00:53:21.940" style="s2">because you chase consciousness back and</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:23.620" style="s2">like it disappears into the mystery of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.940" end="00:53:26.140" style="s2">our past and we have no idea what its</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.620" end="00:53:28.450" style="s2">relationship is with matter but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.140" end="00:53:29.950" style="s2">force that gives rise to the cosmos and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.450" end="00:53:31.750" style="s2">drives evolution it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.950" end="00:53:33.580" style="s2">getting pretty close to God there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.750" end="00:53:35.800" style="s2">even just pragmatically speak and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.580" end="00:53:37.540" style="s2">certainly you know not close to but in</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.800" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">the midst of an argument about freewill</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.540" end="00:53:41.020" style="s2">because obviously if you if you make the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:42.700" style="s2">hard determinist argument that freewill</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.020" end="00:53:44.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist and the consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.700" end="00:53:46.210" style="s2">merely a sort of trick that your brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.170" end="00:53:49.450" style="s2">is playing on itself then how exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.210" end="00:53:50.980" style="s2">does how does culture propagate how do</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.450" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">we how do these memes propagate how are</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.980" end="00:53:53.950" style="s2">people choosing hmm sexual selection of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:55.270" style="s2">natural selection become one of the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.950" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">as soon as you boil sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.270" end="00:54:00.490" style="s2">down to natural selection oh you know so</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:02.080" style="s2">I think the freewill argument I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.490" end="00:54:04.090" style="s2">see why Harris gets tangled up in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.080" end="00:54:05.830" style="s2">you know because well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.090" end="00:54:07.480" style="s2">deterministic arguments are unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.830" end="00:54:10.210" style="s2">powerful and when we use deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.480" end="00:54:11.650" style="s2">models for many things they really were</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.210" end="00:54:13.570" style="s2">right so you could say well we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.650" end="00:54:15.960" style="s2">use that by defaults like fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.570" end="00:54:19.150" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna deviate from that with care</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.960" end="00:54:22.300" style="s2">but I don&#39;t see people as driven like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.150" end="00:54:25.020" style="s2">clocks winding down first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.300" end="00:54:28.750" style="s2">don&#39;t wind down in any simple way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.020" end="00:54:31.300" style="s2">dissipative structures to use he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.750" end="00:54:32.770" style="s2">routing them what is life a human being</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.300" end="00:54:34.870" style="s2">is a dissipative structure we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.770" end="00:54:37.450" style="s2">we&#39;re not an entropic structure like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.870" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">clock running down we are in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.450" end="00:54:42.010" style="s2">but as living beings we pull energy in</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:43.570" style="s2">and so we&#39;re not winding down like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.010" end="00:54:45.910" style="s2">deterministic structure or something</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.570" end="00:54:49.450" style="s2">other than that and the way we treat</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.910" end="00:54:52.420" style="s2">each other is as logos as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.450" end="00:54:54.790" style="s2">tell the way I treat myself right if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.420" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">going to be good to myself in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.790" end="00:54:59.860" style="s2">sense is that I&#39;m an active agent of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:02.320" style="s2">choice confronting an infinite landscape</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.860" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">of potential and casting that potential</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.320" end="00:55:06.940" style="s2">into a reality</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:09.280" style="s2">for good or for evil okay and if I treat</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.940" end="00:55:11.560" style="s2">myself that way then I have proper</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.280" end="00:55:13.450" style="s2">respect for myself and proper fear of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.560" end="00:55:15.550" style="s2">myself because I can make bad decisions</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.450" end="00:55:17.710" style="s2">and warp the structure of reality and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.550" end="00:55:19.960" style="s2">think if you read Frankel for example or</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.710" end="00:55:21.610" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn and you see how your bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.960" end="00:55:23.860" style="s2">decisions could warp the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.610" end="00:55:27.580" style="s2">reality then that wakes you up right</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.860" end="00:55:29.890" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s that if you don&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.580" end="00:55:32.380" style="s2">yourself like an an act of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.890" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">imbued with logos then your life doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.380" end="00:55:36.760" style="s2">go well but more if you don&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:39.250" style="s2">other people that way they do not want</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.760" end="00:55:41.140" style="s2">to play with you if we set up societies</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.250" end="00:55:43.510" style="s2">that aren&#39;t predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.140" end="00:55:45.609" style="s2">people are like that then the societies</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.510" end="00:55:48.340" style="s2">become they dissolve or they become</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.609" end="00:55:50.859" style="s2">totalitarian almost instantly so then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.340" end="00:55:51.550" style="s2">would say well you&#39;ve got the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.859" end="00:55:53.619" style="s2">determinism</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.550" end="00:55:56.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like fair enough man how do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.619" end="00:55:59.170" style="s2">reconcile the fact that if you lay out a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.470" end="00:56:03.580" style="s2">society at every level of analysis on</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.170" end="00:56:05.170" style="s2">strict deterministic grounds it fails</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.580" end="00:56:07.780" style="s2">so doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t that mean your</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.170" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">hypothesis has a flaw I mean maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.780" end="00:56:11.020" style="s2">maybe you could say no the facts are</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:12.850" style="s2">independent of the ethical contract</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.020" end="00:56:14.170" style="s2">exactly this is where the truth deterred</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.850" end="00:56:15.880" style="s2">this is where the truth pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.170" end="00:56:17.140" style="s2">question moves back into being pregnancy</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.880" end="00:56:18.670" style="s2">I would say well it&#39;s true regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.140" end="00:56:21.310" style="s2">what the effect is mhm and you would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.670" end="00:56:22.540" style="s2">well it&#39;s obviously not true if morals</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.310" end="00:56:24.460" style="s2">aren&#39;t constructed for a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.540" end="00:56:27.070" style="s2">reason and if this fragment doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:28.450" style="s2">if it falls into nothing it also depends</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.070" end="00:56:30.070" style="s2">to some degree on what you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.450" end="00:56:32.260" style="s2">how you&#39;re willing to test your</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.070" end="00:56:33.970" style="s2">hypothesis because I might say well if</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.260" end="00:56:36.430" style="s2">your hypothesis is factually correct</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.970" end="00:56:39.369" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you assume that if people based</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.430" end="00:56:42.220" style="s2">their their their their behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.369" end="00:56:44.320" style="s2">individually and familial and socially</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.220" end="00:56:45.910" style="s2">on that set of facts which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.320" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">what Sam claims about facts to do in</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.910" end="00:56:51.250" style="s2">with if you base your ethos on that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:53.320" style="s2">those facts wouldn&#39;t it work right well</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.250" end="00:56:54.580" style="s2">he claims that that&#39;s a test you know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.320" end="00:56:56.950" style="s2">would say well then it fails that test</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.580" end="00:56:59.140" style="s2">yeah it doesn&#39;t work we have to treat</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.950" end="00:57:01.570" style="s2">each other like divine Centers of</p>

<p begin="00:57:01.570" end="00:57:07.510" style="s2">work yes I think well that&#39;s I can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.230" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">any way out of those arguments yeah III</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.510" end="00:57:10.540" style="s2">can&#39;t see there obviously which is why</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.010" style="s2">you and I agree on so much about this</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.540" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">kind of stuff and I think that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.010" end="00:57:15.400" style="s2">the reason why people find your work</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:17.109" style="s2">really inspiring you know while the left</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.400" end="00:57:19.030" style="s2">wants to claim that you are an angry</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.109" end="00:57:20.410" style="s2">person they&#39;ll claim similarly that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.030" end="00:57:21.880" style="s2">a deeply angry to press I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.410" end="00:57:24.460" style="s2">it&#39;s been quite an angry conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.880" end="00:57:26.470" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure it has not been but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.460" end="00:57:27.970" style="s2">horrified by what the radical left is</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.470" end="00:57:30.670" style="s2">capable of but that doesn&#39;t make me</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.970" end="00:57:32.650" style="s2">angry exactly and I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.670" end="00:57:33.609" style="s2">demonstrative of why so many people find</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.650" end="00:57:35.680" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing inspiring because</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.609" end="00:57:37.750" style="s2">unlike the radical left which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.680" end="00:57:39.369" style="s2">consumed with the idea of victimhood and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.750" end="00:57:41.770" style="s2">victimology and we&#39;re victims of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.369" end="00:57:44.020" style="s2">system like Marxism makes the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.770" end="00:57:45.340" style="s2">the only way that people suck is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.020" end="00:57:47.050" style="s2">claimant Marxism makes but the only way</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.340" end="00:57:48.700" style="s2">to cure people of sucking is by changing</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.050" end="00:57:50.530" style="s2">the entire system which will in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.700" end="00:57:52.150" style="s2">magical fashion transform the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.530" end="00:57:54.190" style="s2">humanity yeah in the proper direction</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.150" end="00:57:55.810" style="s2">right there exactly the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.190" end="00:57:58.630" style="s2">you&#39;re making and I hope that I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.810" end="00:58:00.040" style="s2">as well is that human beings do suck</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.630" end="00:58:01.780" style="s2">unless they decide you stop sucking</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.040" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">mm-hmm right and then and your whole</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.780" end="00:58:05.950" style="s2">goal is to tell people exactly how it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.450" end="00:58:07.660" style="s2">that they can clean up their rooms near</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.950" end="00:58:08.980" style="s2">Venice raise guns yeah well they might</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.660" end="00:58:10.420" style="s2">as well start with what&#39;s right in front</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.980" end="00:58:13.540" style="s2">of them it&#39;s a lot harder than it looks</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.420" end="00:58:15.460" style="s2">because to clean up your room means to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.540" end="00:58:16.900" style="s2">accept that it&#39;s actually necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.460" end="00:58:18.310" style="s2">you to take that little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.900" end="00:58:20.560" style="s2">chaos that&#39;s in front of you that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.310" end="00:58:22.330" style="s2">chaotic potential and cast it into</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.560" end="00:58:23.890" style="s2">habitable order and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.330" end="00:58:25.120" style="s2">develop the right attitude towards that</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.890" end="00:58:27.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well I&#39;m gonna put my</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.120" end="00:58:29.980" style="s2">room in order well what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.300" end="00:58:32.560" style="s2">order is in relationship to something</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.980" end="00:58:33.850" style="s2">you know like if your desk is ordered it</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.560" end="00:58:35.560" style="s2">means you&#39;ve ordered it because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.850" end="00:58:37.210" style="s2">going to work there and you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.560" end="00:58:39.490" style="s2">there on something valuable and so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.210" end="00:58:41.320" style="s2">order is conceived of in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.490" end="00:58:42.910" style="s2">a Telos it&#39;s like okay you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.320" end="00:58:45.730" style="s2">order your room well what are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.910" end="00:58:47.530" style="s2">do in it like what&#39;s your room for</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.730" end="00:58:49.560" style="s2">what&#39;s the purpose what&#39;s the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.530" end="00:58:52.420" style="s2">you can&#39;t or to your room without</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.560" end="00:58:53.590" style="s2">falling into purpose and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.420" end="00:58:55.510" style="s2">well if you&#39;re gonna fall into purpose</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.590" end="00:58:57.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like try it out on a local scale</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.510" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">first right you don&#39;t want to go out</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.580" end="00:59:01.180" style="s2">there and change the system it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:04.450" style="s2">what the hell do you know leave the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.180" end="00:59:06.430" style="s2">system alone see what you can do locally</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.450" end="00:59:07.450" style="s2">see if you can put yourself together see</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.430" end="00:59:09.130" style="s2">if you can put your immediate</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.450" end="00:59:11.140" style="s2">environment together and you&#39;ll find if</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.130" end="00:59:14.410" style="s2">you&#39;re in a chaotic household and a</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.140" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">chaotic household would be one where no</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.410" end="00:59:18.130" style="s2">one has any discipline no one has any</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.290" style="s2">aims and there&#39;s a terrible battle</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.130" end="00:59:23.800" style="s2">between Cain and Abel going on all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.290" end="00:59:25.270" style="s2">time right so so life sucks and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.800" end="00:59:27.670" style="s2">everything&#39;s miserable and more cynical</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.270" end="00:59:29.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s what wisdom is it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.670" end="00:59:31.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in trying anything</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.650" end="00:59:32.410" style="s2">because everything is meaningless and</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.120" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">who the hell is gonna care in a million</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.410" end="00:59:36.490" style="s2">years and you&#39;re a fool to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.780" style="s2">in any case it&#39;s like there&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.490" end="00:59:41.860" style="s2">household okay and so now you decide no</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.780" end="00:59:43.600" style="s2">despite all that I&#39;m going to put my</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.860" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">room in order it&#39;s like you will have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.600" end="00:59:47.050" style="s2">war on your hands because the first</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:48.730" style="s2">thing the people around you who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.050" end="00:59:50.860" style="s2">aiming down will do is think oh you</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.730" end="00:59:52.360" style="s2">really ate you think you&#39;re so much</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.860" end="00:59:54.310" style="s2">better than we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.360" end="00:59:56.500" style="s2">do you you really think that you and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.310" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">your fancy goddamn plans it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.500" end="01:00:00.760" style="s2">gonna put every psychological obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:03.640" style="s2">we can possibly think of in your way</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.760" end="01:00:06.100" style="s2">because if you succeed even in something</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.640" end="01:00:08.530" style="s2">that trivial you shed a very dim light</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.100" end="01:00:10.420" style="s2">on our existence and so we&#39;re gonna put</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.530" end="01:00:12.850" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do everything we can to take</p>
