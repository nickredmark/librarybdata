<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:08.670" style="s2">creator and founder of qualia which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.290" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">one of my favorite supplements that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.670" end="00:00:11.730" style="s2">guys have probably heard me talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:13.380" style="s2">about like crazy and as you know I only</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">talk about things that I actually use</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.380" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">love and really believe in and I got to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">meet Daniel here at the bulletproof</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">conference recently and we had such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">powerful conversation and so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">get him on to share with you guys what a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">little bit of background about qualia</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">and neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">and himself it&#39;s amazing story so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">know thank you so much for being here</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">with us and I just would love for you to</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.960" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">why you created oh yeah yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">thank you Rachel it&#39;s fun to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">with the end okay so neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:56.340" style="s2">collective is our company that&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">right now on a complex systems approach</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.340" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">to mind brain health way of saying it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">when we say complex systems what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">is rather than try to identify</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:09.270" style="s2">individual parts of this profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">complex regulatory system and say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.270" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">gonna change your dopamine levels we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">going to use one synthetic molecule</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">right wellbutrin and adderall with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">ethanol whatever to change this or to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">change your serotonin or how does the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">body naturally produce and regulate</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">those molecules on its own and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">off is it off because of a genomic issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:31.470" style="s2">is it off because of functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">dynamics that are going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.470" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">person&#39;s body like pathogens toxins you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">know is it off because nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">deficiency is it off because of head</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">trauma like how do we understand how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">regulatory system works and support it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">to regulate better make sure it has all</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">the raw ingredients it needs and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">right regulatory dynamics so basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.990" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">rather than try to reduce health to what</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">is one chemical that will override one</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">pathway and produce one was old which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">why modern medicine is really great at</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">acute illness I&#39;m really not good at</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">chronic or complex things right so acute</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:07.860" style="s2">injury medicine medicine is awesome in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:10.950" style="s2">the human toxicity or an acute infection</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">it&#39;s awesome but when we look at cancer</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">or neurodegenerative disease</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:17.720" style="s2">autoimmune disease or psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">illnesses we actually didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.720" end="00:02:20.810" style="s2">cures for any of those we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">treatments not cures</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">we don&#39;t have cures or even folk</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">Prevention&#39;s is because the methodology</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:30.530" style="s2">that is currently utilized and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:32.209" style="s2">evolving but the methodology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.530" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">currently utilized now public medicine</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.209" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to identify things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:42.410" style="s2">have very complex causal dynamics so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">believe that&#39;s why I love talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.410" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">so much is because of your background</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">studying complex sciences and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:51.170" style="s2">everything really does affects</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:52.549" style="s2">everything and I&#39;ve talked this before</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.170" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">with my audience and with you about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.549" end="00:02:57.049" style="s2">I grew up with a really first of all</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:02:58.910" style="s2">girth that little girl second of all you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.049" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">know pretty but which led into a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.910" end="00:03:03.410" style="s2">big gut health issue which led into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">lot of different you know both emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.410" end="00:03:08.269" style="s2">ups and downs and you know weight gain</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:10.069" style="s2">and I mean a ton of different things</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.269" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">that I know a lot of people today and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.069" end="00:03:13.700" style="s2">suffer from especially you know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.170" style="s2">help that they don&#39;t even know that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.700" end="00:03:18.260" style="s2">have and they&#39;re just getting these</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.170" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">sounds like weight gain or mood swings</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">or you know a ton of other things by</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m so grateful you on here</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:29.510" style="s2">so I mean what you said is a classic</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:30.859" style="s2">example of what you know medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.510" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">moving into this but what has been a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.859" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">limit is we we take something that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">complex as the human body which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">profoundly complex right like 70</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">trillion cells give or take and less</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">times more than that of bacteria yeast</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:47.569" style="s2">virus protozoa and they&#39;re all doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">about a trillion metabolic functions per</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.569" end="00:03:51.980" style="s2">second and the communications across and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:53.989" style="s2">it&#39;s like so we try and divide it into</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.980" end="00:03:56.299" style="s2">systems like gastroenterology</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.989" end="00:03:59.989" style="s2">Rheumatology oncology right to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.299" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">understand those separately separate</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.989" end="00:04:03.889" style="s2">system so you were just describing a gut</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:05.359" style="s2">brain access dynamic or something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.889" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">happening in the gut can affect what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.359" end="00:04:08.930" style="s2">happening in your nervous system and as</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:11.450" style="s2">we are diving deeper and deeper we</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">recognize inflammation and the gut can</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.450" end="00:04:13.940" style="s2">lead to inflammation in the blood that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">crosses the blood-brain barrier that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.940" end="00:04:16.609" style="s2">creates neuro inflammation that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">create depression anxiety neuro</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.609" end="00:04:19.099" style="s2">degeneration</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">we find that of course nutrient uptake</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.099" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">in the gut whether it&#39;s absorbing</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:24.740" style="s2">nutrients or not those are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:27.750" style="s2">precursors to make neurotransmitters</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.740" end="00:04:30.930" style="s2">that if they type junk</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.750" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">in the gut are damaged so toxins get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.930" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">come in that shouldn&#39;t from food then</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:37.170" style="s2">that can go into the brain the enteric</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">nervous system the nerves that are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.170" end="00:04:42.390" style="s2">the gut are actually giving feedback to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:43.980" style="s2">the brain neurologically the inteiro</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.390" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">endocrine system is affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.980" end="00:04:49.230" style="s2">hormone regulating system says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:51.480" style="s2">pretty much every one of the systems are</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.230" end="00:04:53.070" style="s2">interconnected very profoundly and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.480" end="00:04:55.500" style="s2">you have to take a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.070" end="00:04:57.150" style="s2">approach to support the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.500" end="00:04:59.070" style="s2">system rather than try and override it</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.150" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of the key the key</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.070" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">concept is rather than say oh something</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.390" style="s2">is out of range like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">somebody&#39;s blood pressure&#39;s high so</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.390" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">let&#39;s give them a blood pressure meds</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">that lowers it well this may get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:14.340" style="s2">where their body&#39;s own ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:17.430" style="s2">regulate blood pressure gets even worse</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.340" end="00:05:18.420" style="s2">because in the process of overriding it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:20.760" style="s2">we&#39;re actually overwriting the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.420" end="00:05:22.380" style="s2">regulatory mechanisms blood pressure if</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.760" end="00:05:23.730" style="s2">instead you had the person exercise</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.380" end="00:05:25.169" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is their blood pressure</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.730" end="00:05:26.910" style="s2">is actually spiking higher and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.169" end="00:05:28.380" style="s2">exercise which is triggering in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.910" end="00:05:29.880" style="s2">regulatory response to lower the blood</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.380" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">pressure which is why when people</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.880" end="00:05:34.220" style="s2">exercise mother blood pressure goes down</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:36.600" style="s2">and so rather than say how do we just</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.220" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">the body&#39;s out of range how do we put it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.600" end="00:05:41.970" style="s2">back in range we say no what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">insufficient in the body&#39;s regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.970" end="00:05:46.350" style="s2">dynamics how and how can we support</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:48.210" style="s2">those so itself regulates better and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.350" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">in your chemistry I don&#39;t want someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.210" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">to have the same level of dopamine all</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">the time at the same level of serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.600" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">because sometimes you want to be hyper</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">motivated sometimes you want to relax</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:06:01.560" style="s2">and your body should actually be able to</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:39.539" style="s2">other people is like what&#39;s your stress</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:50.270" style="s2">those things have such a massive impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.750" end="00:06:54.590" style="s2">on either weight gain or mental health</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.270" end="00:06:57.590" style="s2">mental clarity and so how would you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.590" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">that like if somebody is well first</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.590" end="00:07:02.270" style="s2">let&#39;s get let&#39;s get into quality into</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.020" end="00:07:03.980" style="s2">the actual supplement and what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.270" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">different then overs well it&#39;s a no</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.980" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">hacker right is the overall company and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:09.500" style="s2">the collective and and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">different explain this between qualia</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.500" end="00:07:15.560" style="s2">and also not reflected sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:18.020" style="s2">starting to ask question about what are</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.560" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">the foundations of health and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:23.240" style="s2">and gut do you want to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.580" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">because it&#39;s a let&#39;s get into that first</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.240" end="00:07:27.290" style="s2">all right there&#39;s a very brief part</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:28.640" style="s2">medicine gets very complex in a hurry</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.290" end="00:07:32.420" style="s2">when you really start to study in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.640" end="00:07:34.730" style="s2">complex way which is that the total</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.420" end="00:07:36.500" style="s2">amount of genetic differences the single</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.730" end="00:07:39.050" style="s2">nucleotide polymorphism differences and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.500" end="00:07:41.390" style="s2">me versus you is hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.050" end="00:07:43.400" style="s2">and to be able to do precision medicine</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.390" end="00:07:44.900" style="s2">and treat that that&#39;s a long and was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.400" end="00:07:47.150" style="s2">person exposed to mold and if so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.900" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">species of mold and you know where is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.150" end="00:07:49.730" style="s2">lodged in the body and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">toxins have they been exposed to in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.730" end="00:07:54.320" style="s2">pathogens that gives complex and a hurry</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:56.150" style="s2">yes it&#39;s important to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.320" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">when people are dealing with chronic</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.150" end="00:07:59.180" style="s2">illness or have any kind of issue that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:00.890" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been well addressed this is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.180" end="00:08:03.890" style="s2">good functional medicine doctors before</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.890" end="00:08:06.590" style="s2">and people should go find and see them</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.890" end="00:08:09.050" style="s2">but there are foundations of health that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.590" end="00:08:10.190" style="s2">address like most of the stuff for most</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.050" end="00:08:11.750" style="s2">people if you don&#39;t have a really</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.190" end="00:08:12.770" style="s2">complex illness this will be almost all</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.750" end="00:08:14.480" style="s2">of it and if you do have a complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.770" end="00:08:17.710" style="s2">almost this will still be the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.480" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">and so everybody knows what they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.710" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">sleep stress management movement and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.300" end="00:08:28.610" style="s2">nutrition someone gets in and to really</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">just say it very basically all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.610" end="00:08:33.620" style="s2">repair that happens in any system of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:35.420" style="s2">body pretty much all of it like 90 plus</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.620" end="00:08:38.810" style="s2">percent is happening during sleep and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.420" end="00:08:45.080" style="s2">mostly during Delta sleep so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.810" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">is not sleeping in gym and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.080" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">know creating micro tears in the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:53.030" style="s2">quickly those the anabolic processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">that are going to generate new tissue</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.030" end="00:08:57.589" style="s2">are gonna happen when you&#39;re sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:59.509" style="s2">in taking nutrients those nutrients are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.589" end="00:09:01.220" style="s2">going to actually get to be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.509" end="00:09:03.319" style="s2">into new tissue tissues when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.220" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">sleeping and if your immune system is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.319" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">fighting you know infection that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:08.209" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen so sleeping enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:11.149" style="s2">and getting good quality sleep is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.209" end="00:09:13.100" style="s2">foundational would you agree that most</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.149" end="00:09:15.980" style="s2">people are overtraining and under</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.100" end="00:09:19.639" style="s2">sleeping and then causing or would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.980" end="00:09:20.870" style="s2">disagree with that well I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.639" end="00:09:22.970" style="s2">audience is going to be quite different</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.870" end="00:09:24.490" style="s2">than a general audience most people</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.970" end="00:09:27.769" style="s2">aren&#39;t exercising anywhere near enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:29.449" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think there are that many</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.769" end="00:09:31.670" style="s2">people that are overtraining I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.449" end="00:09:33.050" style="s2">there are people who are not taking care</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.670" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">of their body well in the training</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.050" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">process meaning they&#39;re not getting the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">right reparative nutrients they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:39.980" style="s2">eating inflammatory foods that make it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">to where they can&#39;t actually heal the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.980" end="00:09:44.600" style="s2">micro inflammation they&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.110" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">any sleep but the amount that someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.600" end="00:09:49.430" style="s2">can train if they&#39;re taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:51.379" style="s2">their body well is a lot so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.430" end="00:09:54.139" style="s2">less about overtraining and more about</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.379" end="00:09:55.910" style="s2">under regeneration and you know making</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.139" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">sure their biomechanics are right that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.910" end="00:09:59.269" style="s2">they are supporting the lubricity of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">their joints and warming up</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.269" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">appropriately and all that good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:05.779" style="s2">now I love that you said that and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:07.550" style="s2">guess in I guess in in the fitness world</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.779" end="00:10:09.529" style="s2">I say you aren&#39;t you know I just heard</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.550" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard some people say you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.529" end="00:10:14.209" style="s2">gonna get up at 5 a.m. and get it like</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:15.949" style="s2">and get a killer workout the gym even if</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.209" end="00:10:17.329" style="s2">I&#39;m only getting 3 hours of sleep and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.949" end="00:10:19.430" style="s2">haven&#39;t slept at all and I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.329" end="00:10:24.439" style="s2">stressed out if you were talking to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.430" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">somebody who was in that mindset would</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.439" end="00:10:30.050" style="s2">you recommends would you say oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">go workout before sleep or sleep before</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.050" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">sleep more before workout or workout</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">more before sleep I guess is my question</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:46.699" style="s2">if the goal is weight loss so I would go</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:47.959" style="s2">back further and say there&#39;s a person</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.699" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">who&#39;s only sleeping 3 hours a night</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.959" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:54.829" style="s2">their whole life is and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:59.750" style="s2">priorities are probably in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.829" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">place and we would want to probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.750" end="00:11:05.389" style="s2">comprehensively change their life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:07.070" style="s2">that&#39;s again why you know guys I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.389" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so cool that you&#39;re on earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.070" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">your way of looking at things is so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:16.100" style="s2">more slides than most and so you you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.750" style="s2">have a you study complex sciences right</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.100" end="00:11:21.140" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little about your</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.750" end="00:11:25.370" style="s2">background and what led to the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.140" end="00:11:28.820" style="s2">creation of qualia and nirakar it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.370" end="00:11:31.900" style="s2">always interested in I mean all things</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.820" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">that support quality of life and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.900" end="00:11:37.430" style="s2">second therapeutic side and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">physiotherapy decides that wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.430" end="00:11:43.640" style="s2">the primary area of my work but I din</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">across many different disciplines of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.640" end="00:11:49.010" style="s2">science and then working across</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:50.990" style="s2">disciplines of science it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.010" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">neurology gastroenterology that those</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.990" end="00:11:53.300" style="s2">divisions are talking about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">actually understand what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.300" end="00:11:58.850" style="s2">across them the the same is like the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">best insights usually come at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.850" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">intersection of a field like biology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">physics where you&#39;re taking pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:05.840" style="s2">different perspectives on the world and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:08.860" style="s2">being able to see what is true at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.840" end="00:12:11.180" style="s2">intersection of those right so I study</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:13.550" style="s2">basically meta methods with</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.180" end="00:12:15.650" style="s2">epistemologies methods of knowing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.550" end="00:12:17.180" style="s2">being able to understand complex things</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.650" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">that require many different methods of</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.180" end="00:12:21.260" style="s2">knowing so complexity science is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:23.420" style="s2">example you take complex systems like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.260" end="00:12:25.700" style="s2">cell or like a brain or like a ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.420" end="00:12:27.020" style="s2">and say well there&#39;s physics happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.700" end="00:12:28.130" style="s2">here and there&#39;s chemistry happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.020" end="00:12:30.440" style="s2">here there&#39;s all these layers of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.130" end="00:12:32.030" style="s2">organization and we can&#39;t separate out</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.440" end="00:12:33.590" style="s2">one variable and study it in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.030" end="00:12:36.290" style="s2">and think we know what the system does</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.590" end="00:12:37.580" style="s2">because the system dynamics are a result</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.290" end="00:12:38.990" style="s2">of the synergy between all these</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.580" end="00:12:41.570" style="s2">variables interacting in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.990" end="00:12:44.030" style="s2">are so they&#39;re normal how do we isolate</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.570" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">for a variable just doesn&#39;t work and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.030" end="00:12:48.830" style="s2">complexity science is a type of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">methodology for understanding very</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.830" end="00:12:53.480" style="s2">complex systems when you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:57.140" style="s2">variable isolation so I had a background</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.480" end="00:13:00.860" style="s2">in in how to go about studying complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.140" end="00:13:04.450" style="s2">things I ended up getting diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.860" end="00:13:08.960" style="s2">autoimmune and neurological disease and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:10.760" style="s2">it was neither treatable treatable but</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.960" end="00:13:14.600" style="s2">not curable in the allopathic world or</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.760" end="00:13:17.480" style="s2">the innovative world and it was rapid</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.600" end="00:13:18.920" style="s2">onset and so I just said about studying</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.480" end="00:13:20.630" style="s2">and said well let&#39;s see if we can find</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.920" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">some solutions because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.630" end="00:13:25.220" style="s2">I I&#39;m used to studying how complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:29.260" style="s2">systems regulate so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.220" end="00:13:37.840" style="s2">off in my regulatory process and really</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.260" end="00:13:42.890" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know that yeah I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.840" end="00:13:43.790" style="s2">exercising heavily and started to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.890" end="00:13:45.830" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.790" end="00:13:49.300" style="s2">joints hurting joint injuries and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.830" end="00:13:52.130" style="s2">all of a sudden within about a week had</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.300" end="00:13:54.830" style="s2">immobility and when did the Rheumatology</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.130" end="00:13:58.460" style="s2">sub autoimmune antibodies and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.830" end="00:14:00.890" style="s2">rapid onset so what happened was if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.460" end="00:14:03.650" style="s2">take a disease like rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.890" end="00:14:07.940" style="s2">or MS or some complex almost like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.650" end="00:14:09.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t have one cause and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.940" end="00:14:11.930" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the same set of causes</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.800" end="00:14:14.420" style="s2">for different people what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.930" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">when we call it rheumatoid arthritis or</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.420" end="00:14:18.620" style="s2">whatever we&#39;re calling it Alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:20.330" style="s2">autism Indian post is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.620" end="00:14:21.590" style="s2">certain tissues or certain systems that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.330" end="00:14:23.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t working properly they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.590" end="00:14:24.860" style="s2">damaged in certain characteristic ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.270" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">that have markers it doesn&#39;t tell us</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.860" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">anything about the cause which is why we</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:29.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have a cure and so what we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:32.390" style="s2">is different things that statistically</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.900" end="00:14:34.280" style="s2">correlate so in some percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.390" end="00:14:35.870" style="s2">people more than random this infection</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.280" end="00:14:37.460" style="s2">correlates but not in everybody so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.870" end="00:14:38.780" style="s2">can&#39;t say that infection is the cause</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.460" end="00:14:40.370" style="s2">but the fact that it statistically</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.780" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">correlates more than random is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.370" end="00:14:43.580" style="s2">interesting and in other people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">this thing right new there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.580" end="00:14:47.630" style="s2">bunch of things so I started looking for</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">what is everything that statistically</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.630" end="00:14:51.470" style="s2">correlates with the conditions that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:54.140" style="s2">have it could be part of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.470" end="00:14:56.330" style="s2">causal set meaning that each of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.140" end="00:14:58.700" style="s2">things decrease the body&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.330" end="00:15:00.830" style="s2">regulate itself what we call the homeo</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.700" end="00:15:02.540" style="s2">dynamics of the body and then that makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.830" end="00:15:03.500" style="s2">us more susceptible to the next ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.540" end="00:15:05.960" style="s2">because we&#39;re already less well</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.500" end="00:15:07.610" style="s2">regulated and when enough dysregulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.960" end="00:15:08.960" style="s2">occurs now certain tissues start to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.610" end="00:15:11.180" style="s2">break down or certain systems start to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.960" end="00:15:13.940" style="s2">break down that means there&#39;s some set</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.180" end="00:15:15.680" style="s2">of things that are going on that is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.940" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">just one thing they might be that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.680" end="00:15:18.590" style="s2">might have happened in time right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:21.470" style="s2">food poisoning that happened where there</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.590" end="00:15:23.180" style="s2">was some lingering infection from</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.470" end="00:15:25.280" style="s2">international travel and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.180" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">pesticide exposure when farming and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.280" end="00:15:29.450" style="s2">the head trauma and the cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:31.490" style="s2">effect becomes disease twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.450" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">later so I looked at what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.490" end="00:15:34.529" style="s2">things that could be involved</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.420" style="s2">I went did Barry</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.529" end="00:15:37.889" style="s2">strange obscure Diagnostics around all</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.420" end="00:15:39.569" style="s2">that found the set of things going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.889" end="00:15:41.939" style="s2">for me figured out how to treat those</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.569" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">and reversed those pathologies all</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.939" end="00:15:46.560" style="s2">autoimmune antibodies everything changed</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">and the process started to get insight</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.560" end="00:15:51.059" style="s2">into how to think about complex illness</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">and ended up being able to work with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.059" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">number of other friends and people that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:15:59.879" style="s2">had complex illness and see things shift</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:02.069" style="s2">for them and start to model different</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.879" end="00:16:03.870" style="s2">way of thinking about medicine as how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.069" end="00:16:05.699" style="s2">we identify the health of all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.870" end="00:16:07.100" style="s2">regulatory systems and increase the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.699" end="00:16:09.269" style="s2">regulatory capacity of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.100" end="00:16:11.430" style="s2">when we were doing it we started to</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.269" end="00:16:12.629" style="s2">focus on neuropsych a lot because pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.430" end="00:16:15.629" style="s2">much everyone doing with complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.629" end="00:16:17.339" style="s2">illnesses one had a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.629" end="00:16:19.259" style="s2">depression and anxiety around it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.339" end="00:16:20.850" style="s2">they had a hard time with the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.259" end="00:16:23.009" style="s2">to do all the stuff they needed to do to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.850" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">get well and they had brain fog between</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.009" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">a hard for them to learn and so actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:29.850" style="s2">being able to have them think clearly</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:33.439" style="s2">and have the capacity to do stuff was</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.850" end="00:16:33.439" style="s2">kind of important early in the process</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.769" end="00:16:38.220" style="s2">especially I mean I can&#39;t tell how many</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:41.490" style="s2">people I hear myself included that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.220" end="00:16:44.069" style="s2">just like I can&#39;t think clearly or I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:45.269" style="s2">can&#39;t I don&#39;t have that ability to focus</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.069" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">the way that I feel like I want you</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.269" end="00:16:49.709" style="s2">especially in the world of distractions</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">that we live in like there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.709" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">going on all the time and and grant it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.040" style="s2">to you some people like Oh we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">make a choice and just decide but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.040" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">think there really are obviously there</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.110" end="00:17:04.409" style="s2">are certain things that systems are out</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:06.539" style="s2">of whack due to either stress or a diet</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.409" end="00:17:09.929" style="s2">or not getting the nutrients they need</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.539" end="00:17:11.939" style="s2">and so in a product that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.929" end="00:17:13.589" style="s2">created that ice alone and if known as</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.939" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">such a difference in my life from taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.589" end="00:17:18.600" style="s2">and then I keep raving about sequel what</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:23.329" style="s2">makes this product so different than I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.600" end="00:17:26.760" style="s2">guess anything else that is out there so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.329" end="00:17:28.740" style="s2">qualia is broadly and not robic which</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.760" end="00:17:31.409" style="s2">means chemistry that&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.740" end="00:17:33.870" style="s2">enhance cognitive function and to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.409" end="00:17:36.899" style="s2">without any kind of meaningful downside</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.870" end="00:17:39.539" style="s2">your side effects that&#39;s in distinction</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.899" end="00:17:41.270" style="s2">to smart drugs so smart drugs typically</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.539" end="00:17:45.030" style="s2">we think of pharmaceuticals like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.270" end="00:17:48.450" style="s2">adderall modafinil by bands wellbutrin</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.030" end="00:17:51.779" style="s2">etc they&#39;re usually either a TD drugs or</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.450" end="00:17:54.299" style="s2">or sometimes narcolepsy drugs or</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.779" end="00:17:56.399" style="s2">neurodegeneration drugs and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.299" end="00:17:59.399" style="s2">definitely will increase some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.399" end="00:18:01.309" style="s2">cognitive function like focus but with</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.399" end="00:18:04.529" style="s2">some pretty meaningful side effects and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.309" end="00:18:06.929" style="s2">so I&#39;m not going to talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.529" end="00:18:09.299" style="s2">medical use but a lot of people use them</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.929" end="00:18:11.880" style="s2">off-label right they just the black</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.299" end="00:18:14.490" style="s2">market on those is very high and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.789" end="00:18:34.919" style="s2">because so so many people do want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.419" end="00:18:36.389" style="s2">focus and be productive more than they</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.919" end="00:18:38.669" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re capable of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.389" end="00:18:41.789" style="s2">lot of factors that are involved but no</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.669" end="00:18:43.889" style="s2">chemistry is one of the factors and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.789" end="00:18:45.510" style="s2">know if you think about like adderall or</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.889" end="00:18:47.190" style="s2">most most of the smart drugs that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.510" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">take not all of them but most of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.190" end="00:18:54.360" style="s2">are affecting the dopamine system</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:56.519" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re at some</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.360" end="00:18:58.260" style="s2">point usually presynaptic dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.519" end="00:19:00.360" style="s2">agonists but they&#39;re they&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.260" end="00:19:02.279" style="s2">dopamine in one part of the system by</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.360" end="00:19:04.169" style="s2">kind of overriding the way the body</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.279" end="00:19:06.179" style="s2">naturally produces dopamine which is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.169" end="00:19:07.889" style="s2">if you stay on it for a while your</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.179" end="00:19:09.480" style="s2">system down regulates and then you feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.889" end="00:19:12.510" style="s2">like sure when you get off which is and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.480" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right and so we wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.510" end="00:19:15.450" style="s2">something that was the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:18.570" style="s2">dependence creating rather than override</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.570" end="00:19:21.899" style="s2">those neurotransmitters could we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.950" end="00:19:23.519" style="s2">actually look at how it regulates them</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.899" end="00:19:26.130" style="s2">support each step in the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.519" end="00:19:27.990" style="s2">process so that the regulatory system</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.130" end="00:19:29.700" style="s2">itself got better so if someone was on</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.990" end="00:19:31.470" style="s2">it for a while and got off they asked</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.700" end="00:19:35.220" style="s2">you at a lasting benefit rather than at</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.470" end="00:19:38.299" style="s2">dependence and downside and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.220" end="00:19:38.299" style="s2">one of our design goals</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.600" end="00:19:48.519" style="s2">so rather than you know just override</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:50.380" style="s2">the dopamine system create dependence</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.519" end="00:19:52.450" style="s2">would want to actually support the</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.450" end="00:19:56.549" style="s2">you know for those who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.070" end="00:19:58.980" style="s2">dopamine is one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.549" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">neurotransmitters that is involved in</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:09.669" style="s2">recognition lots of things so you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.669" end="00:20:14.590" style="s2">along with serotonin and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.580" end="00:20:16.690" style="s2">even I mean I would guess use oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.590" end="00:20:18.879" style="s2">to you know of like all those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.690" end="00:20:21.519" style="s2">that make you feel good and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.879" end="00:20:23.860" style="s2">people you know that if you have low</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.519" end="00:20:25.690" style="s2">dopamine or serotonin levels like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.860" end="00:20:27.399" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna feel as good as if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.690" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">do and I thought explain where I can I</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.399" end="00:20:31.539" style="s2">can literally feel if I&#39;m like I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:33.580" style="s2">feel if I&#39;m like oh my dopamine is lower</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.539" end="00:20:37.090" style="s2">than my serotonin is really low today</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.580" end="00:20:38.529" style="s2">and even if I&#39;m deficient in B vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.090" end="00:20:41.110" style="s2">like I&#39;ve gotten to know myself so well</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.529" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">from different you know blood tests as</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.110" end="00:20:45.549" style="s2">well as just</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:48.580" style="s2">self-experimentation it like I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.549" end="00:20:49.929" style="s2">that and I just my main message I really</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.580" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">want to help people understand is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.929" end="00:20:54.039" style="s2">know you there might not be something</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:57.399" style="s2">necessarily wrong with you or you might</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.039" end="00:20:59.950" style="s2">not be just did not give up you know it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.399" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">could be as simple as if you got more B</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.950" end="00:21:03.190" style="s2">vitamins in your system not just taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:05.110" style="s2">them but also just knowing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.190" end="00:21:07.450" style="s2">actually absorbing them and that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.110" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">weren&#39;t be deficient or D deficient it</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.450" end="00:21:11.409" style="s2">could completely change the way you feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.850" end="00:21:12.580" style="s2">not only about not only your energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.409" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">levels also do what you feel about</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.580" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">yourself and the world around you and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:19.480" style="s2">your ability to handle stress and your</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.029" style="s2">body&#39;s ability to just feel lighter</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.480" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">rather than like heavy and you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.029" end="00:21:27.639" style="s2">felt that before on both ends and I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">want to give hope to anybody out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.639" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">that feels those feelings of either</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:34.929" style="s2">depression or anxiety or complete over</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:37.419" style="s2">exhaustion or inflammation in the body</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.929" end="00:21:38.950" style="s2">that there is absolutely hope I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.419" end="00:21:40.600" style="s2">one of the best things I ever did is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.950" end="00:21:42.700" style="s2">actually get a blood test that showed me</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.600" end="00:21:44.350" style="s2">hey your be deficient hey your Z</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.700" end="00:21:47.500" style="s2">deficient hey your glutathione is really</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.350" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">low like it&#39;s really it&#39;s a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.500" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">here will that help solve those problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:54.190" style="s2">as opposed to just feeling like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">you know there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.190" end="00:21:57.039" style="s2">you or your just have depression and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no answers and you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.039" end="00:22:03.129" style="s2">live in a you know in a not great place</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:05.320" style="s2">like that is so not true and I love that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.129" end="00:22:06.970" style="s2">as you have navigated your own journey</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.320" end="00:22:09.970" style="s2">and found solutions the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.970" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">were suffering with and didn&#39;t been able</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.970" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">to have you know have create success and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:14.740" style="s2">things were meaningful to you that you</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.740" end="00:22:19.539" style="s2">oh sorry my favorite things I I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.750" end="00:22:20.500" style="s2">that is such a so much about Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.539" end="00:22:22.179" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.500" end="00:22:25.000" style="s2">like anytime I find something that helps</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.179" end="00:22:26.230" style="s2">me I just want to share it you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.000" end="00:22:28.120" style="s2">share knowledge and information and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.230" end="00:22:30.279" style="s2">from a place of this is the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.120" end="00:22:32.830" style="s2">do it because I do know that every</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.279" end="00:22:35.049" style="s2">single person is so different normative</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.830" end="00:22:36.789" style="s2">ism or our body is a difference of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.049" end="00:22:39.669" style="s2">complex like you said that what might</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.669" end="00:22:46.450" style="s2">however I that I really feel like trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.230" end="00:22:49.210" style="s2">things you know what I mean I I will try</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:52.450" style="s2">or test out and I think if I trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.210" end="00:22:54.009" style="s2">somebody and they&#39;re giving the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.450" end="00:22:55.779" style="s2">information to try you know like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.009" end="00:22:57.580" style="s2">probably gonna oh yeah I dry it most the</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:23:02.200" style="s2">it can drastically helps my life this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.549" end="00:23:05.259" style="s2">why you read the bio hacker summit is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.200" end="00:23:07.059" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole ethos is if we do a</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.690" end="00:23:28.870" style="s2">effects from the same thing if overall</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.779" end="00:23:31.289" style="s2">the effects are you know have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.870" end="00:23:33.789" style="s2">significance we&#39;ll put that drug out but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.289" end="00:23:35.409" style="s2">to really be able to optimize for</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.940" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have mental illness right they</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.460" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">don&#39;t have low-grade even looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:33.470" style="s2">that or even talking about that you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not that&#39;s not what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.470" end="00:24:39.289" style="s2">were the ubud species was meant to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.440" end="00:24:40.490" style="s2">been there you know and well as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.289" end="00:24:42.649" style="s2">had all these technologies that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.490" end="00:24:45.950" style="s2">helped us become you know evolved as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.649" end="00:24:47.509" style="s2">species yeah also there&#39;s the book can</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.950" end="00:24:50.330" style="s2">be blessings and also some really</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.509" end="00:24:52.519" style="s2">negative side effects to it and I love</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.330" end="00:24:54.830" style="s2">that you&#39;re bringing that how can we use</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.519" end="00:24:57.619" style="s2">all these amazing innovations and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.830" end="00:25:00.259" style="s2">science to help counterbalance those</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.619" end="00:25:02.509" style="s2">things think about it this way when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.259" end="00:25:05.659" style="s2">develop a drug that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.509" end="00:25:07.399" style="s2">affect one part of the physiology it</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.659" end="00:25:09.049" style="s2">oftentimes the side-effects are because</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.399" end="00:25:11.090" style="s2">it&#39;s affecting other things as well and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.049" end="00:25:12.169" style="s2">in ways that aren&#39;t positive and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.090" end="00:25:14.570" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.169" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">underlying cause so will the statin old</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.570" end="00:25:19.999" style="s2">cholesterol yes is it also toxic to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:22.820" style="s2">liver in the brain and etc yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.999" end="00:25:24.830" style="s2">so this is the problem this is why</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.820" end="00:25:26.419" style="s2">complexity science matters is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.830" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">understand what&#39;s actually causing</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.419" end="00:25:29.509" style="s2">what&#39;s going on when the cause is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">complex and how do you do things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.509" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">are comprehensively positive not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:35.119" style="s2">positive for one thing negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:37.399" style="s2">somewhere else in general this has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.119" end="00:25:39.830" style="s2">the issue with tech is not just in drugs</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.399" end="00:25:41.299" style="s2">we develop technology that is good for</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.830" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">something and externalizes harm</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.299" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">somewhere else and then the results as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:45.169" style="s2">civilization that has a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:47.990" style="s2">wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.169" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">and so like the paint on the wall behind</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.990" end="00:25:52.460" style="s2">me it&#39;s cool to have paint and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:25:54.259" style="s2">want mold to grow in our houses so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.460" end="00:25:56.299" style="s2">started putting fungicides in our paint</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.259" end="00:26:00.950" style="s2">and then the net results of course ended</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.299" end="00:26:02.990" style="s2">up being fun Josiah&#39;s it resistant molds</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.950" end="00:26:04.249" style="s2">that are kind of like the mersa the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.990" end="00:26:05.629" style="s2">antibiotic resistant you know mold</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.249" end="00:26:07.429" style="s2">species that are why so many people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.629" end="00:26:11.269" style="s2">multiplicity today they never did before</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.429" end="00:26:13.309" style="s2">is because we actually may be mold and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.269" end="00:26:14.840" style="s2">the paint paint is putting out all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.309" end="00:26:17.230" style="s2">tile organic compounds things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.840" end="00:26:20.450" style="s2">formaldehyde etc that are neurotoxic and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.230" end="00:26:21.080" style="s2">endocrine disruptors and could we make</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.450" end="00:26:23.270" style="s2">painted</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.080" end="00:26:25.040" style="s2">have those things yes but the key is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.270" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">paint is affecting a lot more things</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.040" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">than we thought it was so we built it</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.020" style="s2">for one purpose well it was affecting a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.640" end="00:26:31.970" style="s2">lot of things and was affecting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.020" end="00:26:34.820" style="s2">the other ones negatively so when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.970" end="00:26:36.470" style="s2">look at people&#39;s life today their time</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.820" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">on Facebook is the same thing did</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.470" end="00:26:40.700" style="s2">Facebook connect the world in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:43.010" style="s2">meaningful ways yes it also make people</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.700" end="00:26:44.630" style="s2">who started creating click optimised</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.010" end="00:26:47.660" style="s2">personas that are not who they really</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.630" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">are where the more persona the more that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.660" end="00:26:51.290" style="s2">persona gets liked the more of a fraud</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2">and a phony they feel the lonelier they</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.290" end="00:26:55.720" style="s2">get in the more they need a dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:59.330" style="s2">head from a blue 2d screen like this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.720" end="00:27:01.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of places where our world</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.330" end="00:27:03.560" style="s2">is really a world that humans didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.790" end="00:27:05.690" style="s2">evolve in and we&#39;re not adapting to and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.560" end="00:27:07.400" style="s2">has actually not good for us and so one</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.690" end="00:27:11.660" style="s2">of the foundations for people to start</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.400" end="00:27:14.120" style="s2">thinking about is a lot of anxiety a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.660" end="00:27:16.940" style="s2">of depression has psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.120" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">physiological components that come from</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.940" end="00:27:24.430" style="s2">living in a world direction on adaptogen</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:24.430" style="s2">world and that&#39;s honestly why what a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:32.540" style="s2">life before likes because I literally</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.160" end="00:27:33.830" style="s2">felt so well depressed like I did not</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.540" end="00:27:36.140" style="s2">like the way that I felt because</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.830" end="00:27:38.120" style="s2">especially as an actress I had my my</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.140" end="00:27:39.650" style="s2">management team and agent she meant that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.120" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">at the time was like up your numbers up</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.650" end="00:27:43.670" style="s2">your numbers and all I could think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:45.080" style="s2">was I out of the obsession I&#39;m like what</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.670" end="00:27:46.370" style="s2">am I gonna post next are people gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.080" end="00:27:48.260" style="s2">like it and what if they don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.370" end="00:27:49.280" style="s2">and let me check in see if they did you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:51.380" style="s2">know what I mean and I couldn&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.280" end="00:27:54.440" style="s2">find myself to be present in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.380" end="00:27:55.880" style="s2">that I was and I started just kidding so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.440" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">I found myself constantly checking</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.880" end="00:27:59.420" style="s2">either Instagram or Facebook to see what</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">other people were doing or what if</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.420" end="00:28:04.190" style="s2">people were like and I just hated it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:06.680" style="s2">I hated hearing about all these amazing</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.190" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">beautiful women that I linked up to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.680" end="00:28:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;re using body morphing apps and like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.900" style="s2">you know it was just it made me so sick</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.400" end="00:28:13.610" style="s2">to my stomach and so finally one day I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.900" end="00:28:15.590" style="s2">was like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.610" end="00:28:17.330" style="s2">I just can&#39;t take it anymore I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.590" end="00:28:20.090" style="s2">gonna go on a social media fast and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.330" end="00:28:22.250" style="s2">picked like this one Sunday to just not</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.090" end="00:28:24.770" style="s2">touch social media and I had done that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.250" end="00:28:26.390" style="s2">since I can even remember and it was one</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.770" end="00:28:27.830" style="s2">of the best decisions I ever made where</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.390" end="00:28:29.930" style="s2">I actually felt like I had this</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.830" end="00:28:32.510" style="s2">connection to the people I was with</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.930" end="00:28:34.279" style="s2">again and I were looking at a sunset</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.510" end="00:28:36.200" style="s2">being like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.279" end="00:28:39.830" style="s2">is there crying and on this massive</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.200" end="00:28:41.119" style="s2">stress which is lifted off and I had</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.830" end="00:28:42.950" style="s2">done nothing different but then just</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.119" end="00:28:45.349" style="s2">make a decision that like I just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.950" end="00:28:47.450" style="s2">gonna touch that that world today and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.349" end="00:28:50.659" style="s2">obviously like I love you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.450" end="00:28:52.249" style="s2">that it plays such an amazing piece in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.659" end="00:28:54.019" style="s2">our world today of being able to connect</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.249" end="00:28:55.940" style="s2">people to be able to share messages to</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.019" end="00:28:57.669" style="s2">be able to create community I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.940" end="00:29:02.929" style="s2">there&#39;s so many great positive benefits</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.669" end="00:29:06.619" style="s2">but I I saw such a massive upgrade in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.929" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">life when I have made a commitment to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.619" end="00:29:11.239" style="s2">when not not touch not look at my social</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:12.379" style="s2">media or even look at my phone for at</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.239" end="00:29:15.349" style="s2">least the first couple hours of my day</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.379" end="00:29:17.690" style="s2">as well as at least once a week take</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.349" end="00:29:19.369" style="s2">like a whole most of the day if not all</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.690" end="00:29:22.129" style="s2">of the day just awesome it completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.369" end="00:29:24.859" style="s2">and I hope and I challenge everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.129" end="00:29:27.139" style="s2">that listens to really just try that out</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.859" end="00:29:29.330" style="s2">because I have so many people I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.139" end="00:29:32.059" style="s2">like are dying for real human</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.330" end="00:29:34.099" style="s2">connections we&#39;re so lost in this the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.059" end="00:29:37.339" style="s2">dopamine hits that come from you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.099" end="00:29:39.229" style="s2">the likes and the the hearts and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.339" end="00:29:41.739" style="s2">like that I want to explain some</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.229" end="00:29:44.239" style="s2">principle that I think will be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.739" end="00:29:46.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a principle called hyper normal</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.239" end="00:29:48.200" style="s2">stimuli meaning you&#39;re getting a stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.700" end="00:29:50.779" style="s2">that is beyond anything that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.200" end="00:29:53.499" style="s2">normally occur and in doing so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.779" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">desensitizes you to normal stimuli and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.499" end="00:29:59.359" style="s2">so this is why you know cocaine is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli there&#39;s really no</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.359" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">way to get that much dopamine in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:05.749" style="s2">natural environment which is why you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.609" style="s2">feel amazing when you get it cuz you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.749" end="00:30:11.649" style="s2">this flood of experience but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.609" end="00:30:14.509" style="s2">why then you need cocaine again and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.649" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">coming down from cocaine sunsets aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.509" end="00:30:17.509" style="s2">interesting people aren&#39;t interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:18.769" style="s2">like nothing else because the normal</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.509" end="00:30:21.049" style="s2">stimuli can&#39;t compete with the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.769" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">normal stimuli and the same thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.049" end="00:30:24.649" style="s2">true when you&#39;re if you get you know if</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:26.330" style="s2">you&#39;re skydiving that&#39;s not a normal</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.219" end="00:30:31.070" style="s2">stimuli adrenaline junkie in a real</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.749" end="00:30:33.849" style="s2">sense meaning the rest of life is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.070" end="00:30:36.409" style="s2">actually not interesting anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.849" end="00:30:37.999" style="s2">sugar is actually a hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.409" end="00:30:39.229" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.999" end="00:30:42.619" style="s2">if you think about it in our whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.229" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">evolutionary environment the closest we</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.619" end="00:30:46.909" style="s2">got to sugar was fruit yeah even the up</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:48.140" style="s2">like the fruit we have now where you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.909" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">just go eat a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.140" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">to pick the berries and they were thorny</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:54.770" style="s2">and they were small and bright</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:59.780" style="s2">hybridized for their sugar content and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.770" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">so because sugar was pretty rare because</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.780" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">salt was right because fat was rare in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:06.020" style="s2">our evolutionary environment we devolve</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:07.580" style="s2">de dopamine hit whenever we got it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.020" end="00:31:09.890" style="s2">because it was evolutionary to try and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.580" end="00:31:11.510" style="s2">get all of it we could for survival now</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.890" end="00:31:14.330" style="s2">that we can produce as much sugar fat</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.510" end="00:31:16.280" style="s2">and salt as we want we still we still</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.330" end="00:31:17.690" style="s2">predict huge dopamine hits when we get</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.280" end="00:31:20.270" style="s2">it even that were not in deficiency</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.690" end="00:31:23.150" style="s2">anymore we&#39;re in excess we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.270" end="00:31:25.280" style="s2">maladaptive now but the other food</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.150" end="00:31:26.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t taste good compared to donuts or</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.280" end="00:31:29.060" style="s2">whatever one you had the hi programs</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.330" end="00:31:30.800" style="s2">today right when you go to social media</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.060" end="00:31:32.630" style="s2">if you go to a dating app and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.430" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">so puzzling that&#39;s why it is causing so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.670" end="00:31:52.490" style="s2">much you know either anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">depression or major self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.490" end="00:31:58.760" style="s2">self-confidence issues in people because</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:32:01.040" style="s2">we are constantly they&#39;re comparing on</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.760" end="00:32:03.980" style="s2">so many different levels to things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.040" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t really what is you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:07.790" style="s2">I love these to the heart hyper normal</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:09.470" style="s2">and I felt that in my life so much it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.790" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">even Nina when I go talk to schools in</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.930" end="00:32:40.520" style="s2">like a private poll and I got up there</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.470" end="00:32:42.290" style="s2">and told them all I was like hey you</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.100" end="00:32:59.540" style="s2">dollars to produce it is not real life</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.530" end="00:33:00.580" style="s2">you know I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a place</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.380" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">things that will desensitize you to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.139" end="00:33:43.149" style="s2">normal stimuli use them regularly and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.950" style="s2">with powerful tools there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.149" end="00:33:47.470" style="s2">responsibility for how to use that tool</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.950" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">so that you&#39;re that it&#39;s not creating</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.929" end="00:34:04.539" style="s2">left Google and said whoa all of my</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.270" end="00:34:20.770" style="s2">possible because the marketers pay us</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.429" end="00:34:21.609" style="s2">more based on time on site and so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.770" end="00:34:23.260" style="s2">have to figure out what is the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.609" end="00:34:24.669" style="s2">addictive possible to keep you</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.909" end="00:34:40.839" style="s2">destruction and saying look like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.429" end="00:34:42.849" style="s2">these patterns and habits that we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.839" end="00:34:45.369" style="s2">that we&#39;ve fallen into like are they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.849" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">actually helping you be a better person</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.369" end="00:34:49.270" style="s2">you know I just think we fall into these</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:52.000" style="s2">both like thoughts patterns and habits</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.270" end="00:34:54.099" style="s2">that that we forget to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.000" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">like is this helping me anymore like</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.099" end="00:34:58.270" style="s2">maybe it did help me at one point but</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:35:00.790" style="s2">like am I still getting something from</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.270" end="00:35:03.400" style="s2">this and if not realizing that you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.790" end="00:35:06.970" style="s2">change it no you couldn&#39;t this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.400" end="00:35:08.470" style="s2">responsible use look like because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.970" end="00:35:09.900" style="s2">might be getting something but you might</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.470" end="00:35:14.290" style="s2">be paying more than it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.900" end="00:35:16.540" style="s2">yeah one of the key things is to notice</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.290" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">difference between addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.540" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually healthy for</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:23.140" style="s2">you and whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">because this is true social medium it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.140" end="00:35:28.990" style="s2">true with drugs with food it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">that your size in terms of how one</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.990" end="00:35:35.380" style="s2">approaches it right in general in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:38.830" style="s2">addiction is gonna give you a momentary</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.380" end="00:35:40.420" style="s2">spike and then because it&#39;s likes you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.830" end="00:35:41.740" style="s2">whether it&#39;s spiking your blood sugar</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.420" end="00:35:43.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s chocolate cake or your</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.740" end="00:35:46.150" style="s2">dopamine because it&#39;s cocaine or your</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.770" end="00:35:48.610" style="s2">dopamine endorphins because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:52.060" style="s2">exercise whatever you get a spike but</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.610" end="00:35:53.830" style="s2">then you also get a crash and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.060" end="00:35:55.060" style="s2">feel shitty for you craving something</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.830" end="00:35:57.070" style="s2">else that&#39;s gonna spike you so you need</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.060" end="00:35:59.530" style="s2">more of that thing and so you actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.070" end="00:36:01.810" style="s2">get more destabilization of baseline</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.530" end="00:36:03.400" style="s2">rather than a more stable baseline and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.810" end="00:36:05.050" style="s2">you get an erosion of your baseline over</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.400" end="00:36:07.210" style="s2">time rather than an elevation of your</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.050" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">baseline so with this and you notice</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.210" end="00:36:10.750" style="s2">when the person is coming down off</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:13.030" style="s2">heroin they&#39;re coming down off cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.750" end="00:36:16.270" style="s2">nothing other than that drug that will</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.030" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">make them happy and so in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.270" end="00:36:20.260" style="s2">like love is not interesting meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:21.700" style="s2">not interesting only that drugging</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.260" end="00:36:25.630" style="s2">because it&#39;s desensitize them to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.700" end="00:36:27.850" style="s2">everything else and so anything that is</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.680" end="00:37:12.490" style="s2">when you see a person that you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:21.880" style="s2">from just seeing a person that you you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.110" end="00:37:24.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have feelings from and so they</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.880" end="00:37:26.770" style="s2">will go through withdrawals if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.820" end="00:37:27.850" style="s2">have that around anymore well so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.770" end="00:37:29.260" style="s2">a way of having risk</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:30.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll use their there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.260" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">actually addressing that with just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.760" end="00:37:36.850" style="s2">couple things most of what people call</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:43.180" style="s2">love is actually just addiction meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.850" end="00:37:45.240" style="s2">I like how I feel when they&#39;re around</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.180" end="00:37:48.100" style="s2">I like how I feel when I&#39;m on the drug</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.240" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">those two I really know who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.100" end="00:37:55.690" style="s2">I respect and admire and value and care</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:57.600" style="s2">for them one for them and so I like how</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.690" end="00:38:02.130" style="s2">I feel in their around is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.600" end="00:38:05.650" style="s2">yeah and ultimately then you end up</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.130" end="00:38:11.260" style="s2">desensitizing and other areas of life</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.650" end="00:38:15.300" style="s2">become less meaningful so harmful even</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.260" end="00:38:19.750" style="s2">harmful relationships because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.300" end="00:38:23.320" style="s2">exactly and so the first thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.750" end="00:38:25.900" style="s2">this relationship am I exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.320" end="00:38:29.470" style="s2">relationship without needing it from a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.900" end="00:38:33.880" style="s2">place of wholeness because we can create</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.470" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">even more beauty together and the basis</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.880" end="00:38:39.970" style="s2">of my draw to them is actually seeing</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:42.370" style="s2">them not not projecting fantasies on</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.970" end="00:38:45.100" style="s2">them because they&#39;re hot but actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.370" end="00:38:46.990" style="s2">really seeing who they are and wanting</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.100" end="00:38:49.930" style="s2">for them and we create together that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.990" end="00:38:53.380" style="s2">if it&#39;s anything other than that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.930" end="00:38:57.550" style="s2">end up being addiction and even if it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.380" end="00:39:00.610" style="s2">that if save save to the poem and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.550" end="00:39:03.160" style="s2">start spending a lot of time together</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.610" end="00:39:05.170" style="s2">and they start associating happiness</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.160" end="00:39:06.520" style="s2">with you they have happiness and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.170" end="00:39:08.530" style="s2">have this experience to the other person</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.520" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">but as a result of them falling into</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.530" end="00:39:13.090" style="s2">this love bubble they stop doing things</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">on their own all of their happiness is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.090" end="00:39:16.120" style="s2">associated with this person they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">experiencing happiness with their</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.120" end="00:39:18.670" style="s2">friends who they aren&#39;t hanging out with</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.350" style="s2">anymore or by themselves which then on</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.670" end="00:39:22.540" style="s2">doing now they start to create this</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.350" end="00:39:25.000" style="s2">Pavlovian association of happiness being</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.540" end="00:39:27.790" style="s2">one-for-one wired with them meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.000" end="00:39:32.890" style="s2">need them to be happy one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.790" end="00:39:34.900" style="s2">things is to be is to keep nourishing</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.890" end="00:39:36.280" style="s2">your individuality well-being in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.900" end="00:39:39.210" style="s2">relationship so that you don&#39;t actually</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:49.930" style="s2">about myself as opposed to the opposite</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.940" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">sensitivity to all of it increases so a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.750" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">sunset is beautiful the flowers are</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.270" end="00:45:48.890" style="s2">small amount of stimuli and pretty numb</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.460" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">to a lot of other stimuli that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.890" end="00:45:56.030" style="s2">sign of being on the wrong track and if</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.560" end="00:46:02.330" style="s2">kind of being on the wrong track and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.020" end="00:46:08.890" style="s2">you can start increasing the sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.330" end="00:46:12.080" style="s2">of your perception to all that is and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.890" end="00:46:15.050" style="s2">decrease the dependence on those areas</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:10.270" style="s2">much detail but the gist is we people</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.270" end="00:47:13.990" style="s2">who were seeking more motivation more</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.270" end="00:47:15.160" style="s2">focus more cognitive capacity and not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.990" end="00:47:18.370" style="s2">just a cognitive capacity but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.160" end="00:47:21.910" style="s2">associated energy and emotional dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.370" end="00:47:24.070" style="s2">it would allow them to be creative we</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.910" end="00:47:27.970" style="s2">wanted options other than going and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.070" end="00:47:30.100" style="s2">finding psychostimulants and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.970" end="00:47:31.720" style="s2">caffeine that were supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.100" end="00:47:33.430" style="s2">physiology side there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.720" end="00:47:35.020" style="s2">psychology and it&#39;s involved but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.430" end="00:47:36.820" style="s2">physiology makes a huge difference I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.020" end="00:47:39.430" style="s2">mean your body is able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.820" end="00:47:41.170" style="s2">produce neurotransmitters it functions</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.430" end="00:47:45.700" style="s2">the way that it&#39;s supposed to function</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.170" end="00:47:47.260" style="s2">and so know that that it&#39;s a part of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.700" end="00:47:49.300" style="s2">whole process it&#39;s not gonna work if</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.260" end="00:47:50.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not sleeping and it&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.300" end="00:47:54.070" style="s2">a lot less well if you&#39;re eating crappy</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.470" end="00:47:57.700" style="s2">food versus eating better food but it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.070" end="00:47:59.620" style="s2">designed to support people to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.700" end="00:48:03.820" style="s2">certain aspect of neurologic health</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.560" end="00:48:28.780" style="s2">can and sometimes I know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.830" end="00:48:31.350" style="s2">about this before you know even even in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.780" end="00:48:33.450" style="s2">that in that freezing of like the</p>

<p begin="00:48:33.450" end="00:48:38.250" style="s2">you have to be better than can can add a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.340" end="00:48:39.990" style="s2">sense of pressure to oneself and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.250" end="00:48:42.570" style="s2">something that I&#39;m constantly working on</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.990" end="00:48:44.550" style="s2">just being able to be you know shift</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.930" end="00:48:51.000" style="s2">like we talked about disrupting that was</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.360" end="00:48:53.910" style="s2">a lot more just gratitude for being and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.000" end="00:48:56.430" style="s2">that is made a big shift but I do know</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.910" end="00:49:00.750" style="s2">one of the when I&#39;m so grateful for is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.430" end="00:49:02.700" style="s2">that when I&#39;ve taken this when I started</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.750" end="00:49:06.900" style="s2">taking this product I was able to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.700" end="00:49:10.050" style="s2">this this feeling of just a peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">powerful focused energy like never</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.050" end="00:49:13.590" style="s2">before and the things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:16.440" style="s2">experience just seemed enhanced as</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.590" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">opposed to I heard I felt this empathy</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.440" end="00:49:21.450" style="s2">and this this love for life again that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">hadn&#39;t really felt in a while and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.450" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">probably because I had tried so many</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:26.310" style="s2">different pre workouts and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">like you said over stimuli that were</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.310" end="00:49:30.750" style="s2">there were me maybe messing up my</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:34.140" style="s2">dopamine serotonin levels and especially</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.750" end="00:49:35.640" style="s2">people who have got health I know that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.140" end="00:49:37.770" style="s2">lot of times that is affecting my</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.640" end="00:49:39.390" style="s2">dopamine and serotonin and all my you</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.770" end="00:49:41.400" style="s2">know neurotransmitters so having</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.390" end="00:49:44.850" style="s2">something that helps counterbalance that</p>
