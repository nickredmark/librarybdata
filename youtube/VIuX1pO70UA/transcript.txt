Well, there is the following
 There is the "good soul" for example
 And what the "good soul" does is act in the world
 In world prospects
 To generate the truth of the world
 And the Judeo-Christian proposal is
 Is that if you encounter the possibilities of the world
 In good faith
 Using the truth
 Sincere communication
 When, then, what results from that is good
 This was repeated in Genesis
 When God used the word
 And the universe was created out of possibility
 And every time he does that he says:
 "And it was good."
 So I think it's very interesting
 There's a suggestion out there, and the suggestion is
 If you face potential with truth,
 The world you create is already going to be good
 Well this one
 This is an interesting idea, if true
 If it is real, then it is the greatest truth in existence
