<p begin="00:00:05.990" end="00:00:16.470" style="s2">starts with Bill and I very much from</p>

<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">title but quite separately</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.490" end="00:00:36.380" style="s2">it&#39;ll found himself drawn into that area</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.760" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">and I met with Edward Muller in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.380" end="00:00:44.579" style="s2">Gothenburg last March and heard about</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:48.809" style="s2">his aspirations for Costa Rica and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.579" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">University and so on and it became clear</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.809" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">that this was was catching on then what</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">happened was that I was challenged to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:13.310" style="s2">a deeper dive into what our approach was</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:17.930" style="s2">really what was the essence of it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.310" end="00:01:17.930" style="s2">eventually I came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.460" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">repositioning of something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">been doing for some years way back that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">we call generative thinking and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">realized that the essence of what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">were trying to do was really to help</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">people generate and so we thought well</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">if you want to regenerate and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:48.950" style="s2">generate that&#39;s not going to work very</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:50.689" style="s2">well so maybe we have a role to play in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.950" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.689" end="00:01:59.820" style="s2">offering ways of deepening and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:03.619" style="s2">accelerating the generative thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.820" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">is part of the requirement of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.619" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">regenerative cultures of course we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">specialize in change in saving</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.910" style="s2">ecosystems or turning cities upside down</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:16.130" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.910" end="00:02:18.430" style="s2">but we feel we can play around with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.130" end="00:02:25.240" style="s2">people who do that kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.430" end="00:02:25.240" style="s2">so um putting something together on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.270" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">led to the question of well what is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.550" end="00:02:42.740" style="s2">about our methods that lend themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:47.470" style="s2">to that field and what emerged was a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.740" end="00:02:53.560" style="s2">synthesis that actually we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.470" end="00:02:57.260" style="s2">components of generative method here</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.560" end="00:03:00.410" style="s2">that we hadn&#39;t realized knew that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.260" end="00:03:03.170" style="s2">they constituted a system that was more</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.410" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">powerful than just the parts alone so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.170" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what I like to share with you so</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:12.230" style="s2">this is the kind of upfront explanation</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:14.440" style="s2">and then because it&#39;s you I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.230" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">a couple of slides on the esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.440" end="00:03:23.060" style="s2">background um since you&#39;re recording</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">this I&#39;ll kind of read it through and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.060" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">perhaps comment but basically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:33.260" style="s2">looking at it that the whole earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.660" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">strategies can be better generated if a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.260" end="00:03:39.080" style="s2">coherent system of generative methods</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:41.030" style="s2">are used to orchestrate the wide range</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.080" end="00:03:44.570" style="s2">of complexities in the many fields of</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:04:01.209" style="s2">as well as large-scale projects so just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:05.300" style="s2">an aside here that our our position is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.209" end="00:04:07.490" style="s2">we we cannot be more than just</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.300" end="00:04:11.450" style="s2">appreciative of these different fields</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.490" end="00:04:14.270" style="s2">we can&#39;t be expert in any of them and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.450" end="00:04:20.770" style="s2">don&#39;t you know take large plots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.270" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">planet Earth and offer to restore it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.770" end="00:04:29.130" style="s2">what we can do is look at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:32.170" style="s2">deeper aspects of regeneration which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.130" end="00:04:36.370" style="s2">that if we can&#39;t think that way can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.170" end="00:04:40.170" style="s2">really do it so this leads us into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.370" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">idea of well it&#39;s a collaborative world</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.170" end="00:04:44.350" style="s2">yet the history and development of most</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.640" end="00:04:47.890" style="s2">of our collaborative methods are based</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.350" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">on analysis specialization a dislocation</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.890" end="00:04:53.560" style="s2">rather than synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:56.230" style="s2">transdisciplinarity and integration this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.560" end="00:04:58.630" style="s2">legacy further exacerbates society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.230" end="00:05:01.900" style="s2">access to the required role of creative</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:15.480" style="s2">comfortably together in fact when I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">drafting this I was suddenly reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.480" end="00:05:23.530" style="s2">God it must be well over 40 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">now as a young scientist reading CP</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.530" end="00:05:33.310" style="s2">snows the two cultures things haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:39.880" style="s2">unis explored many aspects of how</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">making the point that there are decades</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.950" end="00:05:57.340" style="s2">of work by several parties some known</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:06:03.130" style="s2">some unknown that has kind of fed into</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.340" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">this work it didn&#39;t just start when we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.130" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">set up the enterprise called h3 uni to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:15.370" style="s2">enable effective transmission of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:17.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve now been distilled down to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.370" end="00:06:21.220" style="s2">system of five core methods based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.800" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">what we call generated methodology we</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.220" end="00:06:26.070" style="s2">regard generative methodology as a key</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">to human processes of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.070" end="00:06:31.480" style="s2">regeneration and integration able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:33.849" style="s2">scale linked from the personal through</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.480" end="00:06:37.220" style="s2">the local to the global</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.849" end="00:06:40.009" style="s2">so that&#39;s the kind of preface so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.220" end="00:06:46.940" style="s2">does it look like well why is a system</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.009" end="00:06:49.580" style="s2">of methods needed um a benign</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.940" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">integration of humanity with the planet</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.580" end="00:06:53.800" style="s2">makes demands on all aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.840" style="s2">human being mental emotional physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.800" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">just thinking stuff just feeling stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:01.970" style="s2">just doing stuff alone or insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:04.789" style="s2">and easily fall into disconnection</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.970" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">alienation and generation of unintended</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.789" end="00:07:11.900" style="s2">consequences so the following diagram</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:15.229" style="s2">represents the span of concerns that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.900" end="00:07:18.440" style="s2">needed to integrate these factors to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.229" end="00:07:22.580" style="s2">create an integrity so we can look at it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.440" end="00:07:26.349" style="s2">as two large overlapping worlds the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.580" end="00:07:30.860" style="s2">planetary world which of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.349" end="00:07:36.949" style="s2">planet the biosphere the habitats the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.860" end="00:07:40.840" style="s2">whole climate and atmospheric and so on</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.840" end="00:07:45.860" style="s2">which although it&#39;s part of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:49.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a big overlap has its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.860" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">peculiar nature of psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.820" end="00:07:56.419" style="s2">spiritual depth to bring these two</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">together needs a kind of bridging</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:27.289" style="s2">through the inevitable tensions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.930" end="00:08:31.329" style="s2">polarities that arise from what in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.289" end="00:08:33.979" style="s2">language we call the connection or</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">horizon 1 and to do that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.219" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">able to do it in communities we need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:46.190" style="s2">be able to evoke the human world as</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.550" end="00:13:34.390" style="s2">the shiny bits and and linking it with</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.180" end="00:13:43.510" style="s2">next is that of course I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.880" end="00:13:48.190" style="s2">this cosmic ecology work and drawing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.510" end="00:13:50.520" style="s2">heavily on John Bennett&#39;s systematics</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.020" end="00:14:05.290" style="s2">cual systems has an a transformational</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:10.180" style="s2">system which is the pentad the fivefold</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.290" end="00:14:15.820" style="s2">system so what i&#39;ve been looking at as</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.180" end="00:14:17.110" style="s2">it were at the next level is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.820" end="00:14:20.790" style="s2">of arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.110" end="00:14:24.100" style="s2">now the pentad is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.790" end="00:14:28.450" style="s2">diagram which bennett particularly</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.100" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">elaborates in volume 2 of the dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.450" end="00:14:37.300" style="s2">universe and which i used to build the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:38.930" style="s2">system of a cosmos as in my cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.300" end="00:14:43.430" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.930" end="00:14:47.330" style="s2">and it needs a little interpretation the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.430" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">idea is the first of all that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.330" end="00:14:51.460" style="s2">arranged this way because there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:54.200" style="s2">sense of level from lower to higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.460" end="00:15:00.350" style="s2">which lower to higher not in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.200" end="00:15:05.450" style="s2">of a conventional hierarchy but corset</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:09.830" style="s2">definer if you like and and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.450" end="00:15:12.140" style="s2">outer terms here are that as it were the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.830" end="00:15:14.930" style="s2">the outer boundaries of the system in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.140" end="00:15:17.750" style="s2">question and so we&#39;re looking at earth</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.930" end="00:15:19.670" style="s2">at one end and wisdom at the other so</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.750" end="00:15:22.899" style="s2">we&#39;ve got earth here as the world model</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.670" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">and the wisdom wheel symbolizing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.899" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">then you have an inner active role of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:35.860" style="s2">the being in this transformation which</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:40.490" style="s2">has a higher nature a lower nature and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.860" end="00:15:44.300" style="s2">center to use the old alchemical word</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.490" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">quintessence from five incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.300" end="00:15:51.200" style="s2">Bennett took this diagram from the</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.150" end="00:16:13.100" style="s2">because the the key thing that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:15.560" style="s2">shifted at the basic level is the Repat</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.910" end="00:16:37.430" style="s2">caterpillar but all of that needs the</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.450" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">needed so you can use this as a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:55.400" style="s2">further than the kind of bridgie diagram</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.690" end="00:17:00.680" style="s2">on the previous slide and go into some</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.400" end="00:17:05.510" style="s2">fairly detailed elaboration of of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.790" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s also a research tool</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.949" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot more to be learnt</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">from investing but what I find</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:28.490" style="s2">interesting the the quintessence of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:36.040" style="s2">future consciousness in this in what I</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.490" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">keep finding as as though the bits of</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:46.030" style="s2">most excite me are these different</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.070" end="00:17:49.490" style="s2">dimensions of relating to time and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.030" end="00:17:53.210" style="s2">future and and also this notion of reap</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.490" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">happening and the future potential of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.210" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">the present moment I think is enormous</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.610" end="00:18:02.120" style="s2">ly powerful because somehow it takes us</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:04.070" style="s2">away from the notion that when we use</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.120" end="00:18:06.100" style="s2">all these methodologies to get a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.070" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">of people together to kind of work on</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:16.760" style="s2">regions that we they&#39;re all we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.330" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">is improving our understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.760" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">forming some sort of better vision of</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">there but what I see in this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:32.780" style="s2">actual process of engaging with it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">already every patterning because it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:36.679" style="s2">changes how people think and because</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:39.080" style="s2">what changes how people think it means</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:44.030" style="s2">changes and that&#39;s instantaneous and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.419" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make any sense and may be</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.030" end="00:18:54.030" style="s2">very very much because in a way future</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.920" end="00:24:25.100" style="s2">can can manifest something which is</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.820" end="00:24:49.220" style="s2">got a really good research and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:52.550" style="s2">development pathway here now one thing</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.380" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">extent you if you&#39;ve had time to look</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.150" end="00:25:07.790" style="s2">into Nora Bateson&#39;s work on warm data</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">and the warm data labs and I personally</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.790" end="00:25:11.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t even had a chance to look into</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:14.690" style="s2">it as deeply as I would have liked to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.570" end="00:25:16.130" style="s2">but from what I understand and like I</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.690" end="00:25:17.390" style="s2">would love to just take part</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.130" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">one of those labs and sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.390" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">I&#39;ll create the opportunity out Sonora</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:28.130" style="s2">in Delfy and in mid-october so mmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:31.580" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll learn more then but my sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.130" end="00:25:35.030" style="s2">is that the world game and the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.580" end="00:25:37.100" style="s2">systems map and looking at where they</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.030" end="00:25:39.890" style="s2">like in in this kind of fractal</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.100" end="00:25:41.780" style="s2">dimension or the recursive et that you</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.010" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">is warm data is that it is trans</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">contextual data and it is valuing the</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.570" end="00:26:13.970" style="s2">far as I understand Moore has created a</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.909" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">to that multidimensionality of yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:06.299" style="s2">more the present moment than time</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:09.660" style="s2">because time is yes meeting yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.299" end="00:35:11.940" style="s2">and that that at the same time like I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.660" end="00:35:15.420" style="s2">love that early on you mentioned scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.940" end="00:35:18.329" style="s2">linking and like this this which has</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.420" end="00:35:20.549" style="s2">been such a insightful notion for me in</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.329" end="00:35:23.609" style="s2">my thinking about how to how to create</p>

<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:53.069" style="s2">is an intervention but everything we</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.859" end="00:35:55.049" style="s2">experience runs in fast and in slow</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.069" end="00:35:56.670" style="s2">cycles at the same time and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.049" end="00:36:00.390" style="s2">kind of pay attention how our</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.670" end="00:36:03.000" style="s2">interventions make sense in the shortest</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.390" end="00:36:05.309" style="s2">cycles and and the longer cycles and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.000" end="00:36:07.500" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s yet another like to some</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.309" end="00:36:12.210" style="s2">extent the mapping of the world system</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.290" end="00:37:03.780" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s you know to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.490" end="00:37:07.589" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing me having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.780" end="00:37:10.380" style="s2">after what have we been around for 20</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.589" end="00:37:11.099" style="s2">years now you know I mean you know since</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">finto</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.099" end="00:37:15.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know seems a long time no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:22.589" style="s2">actually a wonderful 12 years we met 12</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.450" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">years is it 2007 yeah I came across the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.589" end="00:37:25.740" style="s2">poster of the original systems of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:29.849" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.740" end="00:37:33.990" style="s2">put on with me yeah in tidying up the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.849" end="00:37:35.819" style="s2">lab here so yeah so that now obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.990" end="00:37:40.220" style="s2">if you look at wisdom there are many</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.819" end="00:37:42.569" style="s2">other wisdom methods and traditions</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.220" end="00:37:46.520" style="s2">clearly there are other ways of looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.569" end="00:37:46.520" style="s2">at the earth humans</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.490" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">there are all kinds of systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.620" end="00:37:59.260" style="s2">he things to patent patent language and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:38:02.980" style="s2">stuff there and you know we&#39;ve mapped</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.260" end="00:38:05.170" style="s2">out other futures methods and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.980" end="00:38:07.810" style="s2">there are all kinds of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.170" end="00:38:13.060" style="s2">resolution psychology and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.810" end="00:38:16.750" style="s2">so but our claim is that this is you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.060" end="00:38:19.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s not the only motor car in town</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.750" end="00:38:23.110" style="s2">where it&#39;s a damn good model hmm it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.210" end="00:38:26.980" style="s2">drives nicely so I don&#39;t try you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.110" end="00:38:33.060" style="s2">and there are very few of them around so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.980" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">you know we do with more well it does it</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.060" end="00:38:43.120" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t only it isn&#39;t only generative</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:45.070" style="s2">in terms of the process of engaging we</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.120" end="00:38:47.650" style="s2">either one of those five methods in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.070" end="00:38:50.970" style="s2">particular process of engaging with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.650" end="00:38:54.630" style="s2">focus on a place with a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.970" end="00:38:56.950" style="s2">sequentially with all of them will</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.630" end="00:39:01.000" style="s2">transform the people who engage on that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.950" end="00:39:03.100" style="s2">yes it will it will both transform their</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.000" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">full awareness of the issue there the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.100" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">question like the the system in question</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:11.050" style="s2">or the question in question M but it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:13.090" style="s2">I think more than that because as you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.050" end="00:39:15.190" style="s2">so together it actually builds</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.090" end="00:39:18.100" style="s2">relationship in it and it reap a turns</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.190" end="00:39:21.460" style="s2">and yes and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.100" end="00:39:26.410" style="s2">powerful because it demonstrates what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.460" end="00:39:28.450" style="s2">tries to generate which is that the very</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.410" end="00:39:30.850" style="s2">act of engagement is an act of reap a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">Turing we don&#39;t need to rethink the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.850" end="00:39:37.450" style="s2">future and then start doing it by</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:41.290" style="s2">rethinking of planning model yeah we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.450" end="00:39:43.090" style="s2">already doing it in in that process and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.290" end="00:39:44.950" style="s2">and of course particularly if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.090" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">with people all the time which which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.950" end="00:39:49.690" style="s2">this there&#39;s almost at nauseam theme</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:52.300" style="s2">that runs through regenerative cultures</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.690" end="00:39:54.850" style="s2">the living the questions together that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.300" end="00:39:58.090" style="s2">that I sort of start with and and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.850" end="00:39:58.690" style="s2">repeat yeah a lot that&#39;s that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.090" end="00:40:02.260" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.690" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">that bill is being a being what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:08.650" style="s2">working with him on but the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">problem that the the level of which many</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.650" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">of these challenges come out that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.750" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of future stewards in</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:22.900" style="s2">similar levels is people and not a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.750" end="00:40:26.710" style="s2">coherent group hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.900" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t the that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.710" end="00:40:33.220" style="s2">develop some of these tools they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:36.280" style="s2">in one sense developed in in communities</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.220" end="00:40:38.290" style="s2">or corporations well one could have</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.280" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">people around for a while and they could</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.290" end="00:40:45.900" style="s2">appear more than once yeah and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">seem to have this kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.900" end="00:40:51.069" style="s2">gathering of interested parties and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:53.530" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a day to put them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.069" end="00:40:57.250" style="s2">something and then they never lose the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.530" end="00:40:59.290" style="s2">problem it&#39;s like it&#39;s sharing a method</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.250" end="00:41:01.420" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t share an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.290" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">the power of the method over time</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.420" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">because that I noticed this more and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">more in terms of designing educational</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:12.339" style="s2">experiences or venturing into bringing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.349" style="s2">people together so they can do something</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.339" end="00:41:15.069" style="s2">transformative together if you only do</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.349" end="00:41:18.460" style="s2">that once</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.069" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">it it has a little inspiring effect it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.460" end="00:41:23.560" style="s2">builds human relationships you have all</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:24.819" style="s2">sorts of unforeseen ripples come from</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.560" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">those meetings that might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.819" end="00:41:29.079" style="s2">transformative but if you want the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:31.630" style="s2">actual issues to transform and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.079" end="00:41:33.910" style="s2">people to learn you need to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.630" end="00:41:36.010" style="s2">into some form of action learning cycle</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.910" end="00:41:39.250" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s what this this this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.010" end="00:41:42.460" style="s2">quintet does really would do really well</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:44.140" style="s2">if you if you could convene the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.460" end="00:41:47.650" style="s2">group of people that leaders quest</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.140" end="00:41:51.400" style="s2">managers can be in once and for a day or</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.650" end="00:41:54.490" style="s2">two and over a year five times and each</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.400" end="00:41:57.339" style="s2">time they work with these different</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.490" end="00:41:59.230" style="s2">methods but the issue and in between</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.339" end="00:42:02.349" style="s2">their deepen their dialogue and their</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.230" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">reflection and and then then you really</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.349" end="00:42:06.460" style="s2">have transformative projects growing out</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:08.410" style="s2">of it and even better if you if you just</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.460" end="00:42:10.300" style="s2">work rather than work with disparate</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:11.500" style="s2">groups working with people in place that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.300" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s what I&#39;m so passionate</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.500" end="00:42:14.530" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:22.539" style="s2">for 2020 now I can see that that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.530" end="00:42:26.049" style="s2">that is the the takes the place of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.539" end="00:42:31.020" style="s2">organization or the corporation that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.049" end="00:42:35.530" style="s2">place becomes the co hearing factor in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.020" end="00:42:38.619" style="s2">in the engagement with which which means</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.530" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">that there are people who are consistent</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.619" end="00:42:46.299" style="s2">in their engagement but also they can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">comings and goings as well you see this</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.299" end="00:42:55.980" style="s2">is where I it&#39;s for me yet another</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:59.109" style="s2">reason why I keep on the one hand being</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.980" end="00:43:01.480" style="s2">somewhat scared was my own courage to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.109" end="00:43:03.940" style="s2">try to work by originally again with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.480" end="00:43:05.140" style="s2">whole may your consistent but at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.940" end="00:43:08.170" style="s2">same time that&#39;s what brought me here</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.140" end="00:43:09.940" style="s2">eight years ago of under understanding</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.170" end="00:43:12.220" style="s2">after all these years at the community</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.940" end="00:43:14.410" style="s2">scale and working with Vint on and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.220" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">intentional communities eco villages and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.410" end="00:43:19.420" style="s2">transition towns that so much can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:23.039" style="s2">done at the community scale but to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.420" end="00:43:26.140" style="s2">really create the whole system&#39;s design</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.039" end="00:43:28.539" style="s2">enabling constraints together that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.140" end="00:43:32.140" style="s2">make for the emergence of health and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.539" end="00:43:37.059" style="s2">wholeness in the system you need to step</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.140" end="00:43:40.270" style="s2">up to the bioregional scale and and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.059" end="00:43:43.450" style="s2">also running a process like this over</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.270" end="00:43:44.980" style="s2">time with some people coming in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.450" end="00:43:47.020" style="s2">people coming out with but with a core</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.980" end="00:43:52.150" style="s2">group that got runs through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.020" end="00:43:55.510" style="s2">process and again working with when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.150" end="00:43:58.150" style="s2">work at the local the micro level you</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.510" end="00:44:01.240" style="s2">can create communities of interest you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.150" end="00:44:03.640" style="s2">can gather the usual suspects but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.240" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">minute you step to the bioregional scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.640" end="00:44:10.119" style="s2">you have to engage all the players you</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:12.250" style="s2">have to work across sectors and and kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.119" end="00:44:16.390" style="s2">of face the complexity and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.250" end="00:44:17.859" style="s2">think that that&#39;s where I&#39;m really kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.390" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">of wanting to put my energies over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.859" end="00:44:23.049" style="s2">next couple of years of testing out</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:26.350" style="s2">these type of processes at the bio</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.049" end="00:44:29.260" style="s2">regional scale and data and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.350" end="00:44:33.030" style="s2">be the big challenge for us little guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.260" end="00:44:36.310" style="s2">is is that that&#39;s a huge overhead yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.030" end="00:44:39.400" style="s2">getting that funded like stain because</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.310" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">then the thing is it&#39;s not just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.400" end="00:44:44.650" style="s2">it&#39;s actually peanuts compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:48.220" style="s2">scale of the problem and the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.650" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">resources available but yeah the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.220" end="00:44:56.950" style="s2">the horizon-1 culture doesn&#39;t get it if</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:45:00.700" style="s2">if local governments plus locally</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.950" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">important larger corporations would</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.700" end="00:45:05.020" style="s2">understand that that&#39;s their way of risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:07.780" style="s2">managing the future and building climate</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.020" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">resilience to finance these processes</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.780" end="00:45:11.350" style="s2">then then they could happen everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s what I&#39;ve also realized</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.350" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not enough to be able to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:20.220" style="s2">people who are facilitating and like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:24.670" style="s2">really if you want to engage people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.220" end="00:45:26.320" style="s2">building a transformative community that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.670" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">through running through a process like</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.320" end="00:45:32.830" style="s2">that also transforms and therefore reap</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:37.560" style="s2">patterns you have to somehow resource</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.830" end="00:45:40.390" style="s2">that all the people the participants to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.560" end="00:45:43.570" style="s2">not have to be out of pocket to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.390" end="00:45:45.730" style="s2">taking part in what you&#39;re offering yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.570" end="00:45:46.990" style="s2">and maybe they contribute a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.730" end="00:45:50.920" style="s2">to have some form of energetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.990" end="00:45:53.140" style="s2">engagement but but also to be given time</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.920" end="00:45:55.390" style="s2">to reflect on that process and prepare</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.140" end="00:45:59.110" style="s2">between one and another face to face</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.390" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">element by by staying engaged whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.110" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">it&#39;s through online conversations and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:06.550" style="s2">on and so forth and and and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:09.460" style="s2">like I&#39;ve been starting to look into</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.550" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">writing sort of grant applications for</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.460" end="00:46:14.500" style="s2">these kind of processes and really you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:18.670" style="s2">want to be able to run with groups of 40</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.500" end="00:46:22.570" style="s2">50 60 people that you can invite to</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.670" end="00:46:24.370" style="s2">these and can cover part of their</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.570" end="00:46:27.310" style="s2">organizational time wherever they work</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.370" end="00:46:29.260" style="s2">in which of the four sectors and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.310" end="00:46:32.230" style="s2">just stay engaged with the process and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.260" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">yeah and then you would have a group</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.230" end="00:46:36.820" style="s2">that would over a year or a year and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.250" style="s2">half running through a process like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.820" end="00:46:41.569" style="s2">really come up with</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.250" end="00:46:53.930" style="s2">every patterning of the future of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.569" end="00:46:56.029" style="s2">region yeah that&#39;s the well I I think on</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.930" end="00:46:59.020" style="s2">a personal note if I was your age I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.029" end="00:47:01.910" style="s2">still be up for it but it&#39;s my age I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.020" end="00:47:07.099" style="s2">afraid I&#39;m gonna have to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.910" end="00:47:12.890" style="s2">meta system and feed stuff in you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.099" end="00:47:15.289" style="s2">saying to the guys at h3 uni look we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.890" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">got out a much more modest ambition for</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.289" end="00:47:21.049" style="s2">h3 uni because you know we basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.770" end="00:47:24.140" style="s2">just three old guys and a few friends</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.049" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">you know you know that was that that was</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.140" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2">the peacemaker speaking you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:30.859" style="s2">just calm down and look at who we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:33.500" style="s2">and actually where we are and what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.859" end="00:47:35.390" style="s2">can really do that&#39;s got some leverage</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.500" end="00:47:38.599" style="s2">and I think this is what I&#39;ve shared</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.390" end="00:47:41.750" style="s2">with you here is part of that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.599" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">thrust yeah and what and to just that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.750" end="00:47:53.180" style="s2">excites me is just thinking about you</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.480" end="00:47:59.299" style="s2">know how can I put it with this approach</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.180" end="00:48:04.809" style="s2">here now I think I could start to write</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.299" end="00:48:08.960" style="s2">your book with a slightly different way</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.809" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">please we need many more expressions of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.960" end="00:48:13.490" style="s2">the impulse behind it and because each</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:16.010" style="s2">one speaks differently to different</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.490" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">people and yeah I think the one that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.010" end="00:48:23.059" style="s2">book you bringing out is is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.770" end="00:48:30.859" style="s2">contribution and well it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.059" end="00:48:34.730" style="s2">still upstream but it&#39;s like um it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.859" end="00:48:38.020" style="s2">fashionable to give great value to ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.730" end="00:48:40.510" style="s2">but I think ideas of but in their time</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.020" end="00:48:43.190" style="s2">at the right time they&#39;re very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.510" end="00:48:46.069" style="s2">and we need we need some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.190" end="00:48:47.180" style="s2">like you know the way you pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.069" end="00:48:49.490" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.180" end="00:48:53.660" style="s2">on present-moment multidimensionality</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.490" end="00:48:54.950" style="s2">and you know I was listening to some of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.660" end="00:48:57.789" style="s2">what you were saying just now and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:49:02.990" style="s2">certainly had a flash and thought blimey</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.789" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">that&#39;s almost like Henry talks you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.990" end="00:49:08.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all rubbing off gradually</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:11.319" style="s2">between us you know I mean Henry&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.119" end="00:49:15.049" style="s2">between you and and Henry have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.319" end="00:49:18.170" style="s2">really the two people that have deeply</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.049" end="00:49:18.589" style="s2">deeply shaped the the way I think and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.170" end="00:49:22.099" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.589" end="00:49:25.400" style="s2">other people like I mean Brian Goodwin</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.099" end="00:49:28.309" style="s2">and Stefan Harding have also shaped very</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:30.200" style="s2">much what I think about in the the Union</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.309" end="00:49:32.990" style="s2">what am I thinking but the actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">pattern of thinking and shifting is</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.990" end="00:49:37.700" style="s2">something that that&#39;s why I find it so</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">fascinating that that Henry and Gertie</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.700" end="00:49:42.519" style="s2">the Gertie and approaching is working</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:46.519" style="s2">with that sort of phenom a logical</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.519" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">hermeneutical approach then you the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.519" end="00:49:50.630" style="s2">of all the techniques that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.339" style="s2">explained that they&#39;re h3 unius</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.630" end="00:49:54.769" style="s2">stewarding and has shared through the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.339" end="00:49:56.690" style="s2">website and how people can can work with</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.769" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">these these five methodologies and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.690" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">processes and then to find yet another</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:06.890" style="s2">third group of elders that that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.920" end="00:50:11.900" style="s2">also somehow drunk from the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.890" end="00:50:15.230" style="s2">fountains and through yeah yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.900" end="00:50:19.609" style="s2">there are the elders in Carroll Sanford</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.230" end="00:50:21.079" style="s2">and and and the Genesis group and I find</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.609" end="00:50:24.950" style="s2">it fascinating that they&#39;re all connect</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.079" end="00:50:27.619" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m just continuing to this this</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.950" end="00:50:28.910" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.619" end="00:50:32.239" style="s2">bottom of it eventually</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.910" end="00:50:34.700" style="s2">exactly can you just just briefly before</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.239" end="00:50:36.859" style="s2">I am stop the recording say a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.700" end="00:50:40.579" style="s2">things about your book and what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.859" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">about and when it&#39;s coming out um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.579" end="00:50:52.130" style="s2">well system&#39;s thinking for a turbulent</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:55.390" style="s2">world is a rather ambitious attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.130" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">to portage</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.390" end="00:51:02.920" style="s2">there&#39;s some powerful theories that need</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:06.970" style="s2">to be in my view embedded in practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.920" end="00:51:11.319" style="s2">and in our academic world theory and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.970" end="00:51:13.990" style="s2">practice or rather kept separate so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.319" end="00:51:16.510" style="s2">worst case scenario is it&#39;s a book that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.990" end="00:51:20.680" style="s2">will not be read either by theorists or</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.510" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">practitioners but the designs that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.680" end="00:51:24.279" style="s2">you&#39;re getting from your little</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:27.369" style="s2">experiment with your network suggest</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.279" end="00:51:29.260" style="s2">that maybe there is a population of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.369" end="00:51:31.869" style="s2">people who really want to bring good</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.260" end="00:51:34.299" style="s2">good theory new ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.869" end="00:51:36.250" style="s2">world and good practice like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.299" end="00:51:39.299" style="s2">applying it to together</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.250" end="00:51:44.769" style="s2">so I hope it&#39;s a contribution to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.299" end="00:51:49.000" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s a kind of a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.769" end="00:51:56.440" style="s2">shift that I&#39;ve been obsessed with for</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.000" end="00:51:59.559" style="s2">some time so the reader in search of new</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.440" end="00:52:01.769" style="s2">ways of thinking I&#39;m just reading from</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.559" end="00:52:05.140" style="s2">what will probably be on the back cover</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.769" end="00:52:08.680" style="s2">will be introduced to concepts new to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.140" end="00:52:11.829" style="s2">systems thinking that integrate systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.680" end="00:52:14.980" style="s2">thinking and futures thinking the</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.640" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">consciousness practice yeah I really</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.020" end="00:53:47.589" style="s2">loved reading it and for what I shared</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:50.569" style="s2">with people there&#39;s a lot of resonance</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.589" end="00:53:54.200" style="s2">to it and I think it just has really</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.569" end="00:53:57.619" style="s2">powerful concepts like there is simply</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.200" end="00:53:59.690" style="s2">black term it&#39;s I don&#39;t know if I think</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.690" end="00:54:05.750" style="s2">the the future potential of the present</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.630" end="00:54:11.210" style="s2">moment yes if you really sit with just</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.750" end="00:54:14.390" style="s2">that in it yeah you really have to sit</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.210" end="00:54:17.150" style="s2">with it but it&#39;s powerful and and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.390" end="00:54:20.180" style="s2">in because it also it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.180" end="00:54:24.650" style="s2">about to react against what somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.730" end="00:54:26.299" style="s2">just said then if you think future</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.650" end="00:54:29.720" style="s2">potential at the present moment you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.299" end="00:54:31.609" style="s2">like like Krishnamurti saying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.720" end="00:54:33.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a world between the moment that</p>

<p begin="00:54:33.829" end="00:54:43.000" style="s2">seeing a tiger yes running away in fear</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:46.280" style="s2">or realizing the tiger isn&#39;t hungry and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.000" end="00:54:48.200" style="s2">marveling at its beauty and makes all</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.280" end="00:54:51.170" style="s2">the difference and and and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.200" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s a sort of metaphorical way</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.170" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">that I understand the future potential</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:58.460" style="s2">of the present moment that we can by</p>

<p begin="00:55:19.350" end="00:55:29.190" style="s2">gave is too far in the past to recollect</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.430" end="00:55:31.830" style="s2">properly but it was something like um it</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.830" end="00:55:36.890" style="s2">started by saying all we have is now</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.510" end="00:55:46.170" style="s2">yeah disgust I think that&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:49.400" style="s2">place to stop that regeneration is</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.170" end="00:55:53.510" style="s2">actually exactly what happens now always</p>

<p begin="00:56:38.460" end="00:56:47.550" style="s2">assumption that&#39;s become unhelpful we</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.630" end="00:56:50.940" style="s2">need to look at it differently then the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.550" end="00:56:53.190" style="s2">fourth step catching the Ox is the</p>

<p begin="00:57:09.420" end="00:57:17.279" style="s2">choose fascinating and then the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.470" end="00:57:19.650" style="s2">six riding the Ox home is the step to</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.279" end="00:57:22.440" style="s2">the co creative way that we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.650" end="00:57:25.740" style="s2">this together and we need to practice of</p>
