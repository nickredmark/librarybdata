<p begin="00:00:05.440" end="00:00:09.769" style="s2">Charles Eisenstein has been writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.730" end="00:00:11.750" style="s2">about the need for systems change and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.769" end="00:00:14.480" style="s2">personal transformation for many years</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.750" end="00:00:16.219" style="s2">in books like sacred economics and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.480" end="00:00:19.009" style="s2">more beautiful world their hearts know</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.219" end="00:00:21.409" style="s2">as possible in response to the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.009" end="00:00:24.609" style="s2">crisis he wrote an article the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.409" end="00:00:30.739" style="s2">coronation there has been widely shared</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.609" end="00:00:34.699" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve been foreseeing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.739" end="00:00:35.590" style="s2">also fearing are all coming together at</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.699" end="00:00:38.120" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.590" end="00:00:40.480" style="s2">so on the one hand the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.120" end="00:00:44.839" style="s2">normal that gives us an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.480" end="00:00:47.449" style="s2">choose what we&#39;ve been unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.839" end="00:00:49.789" style="s2">choosing before we also discussed some</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.449" end="00:00:51.350" style="s2">of the criticisms of the article whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.789" end="00:00:53.690" style="s2">it bypassed anger and the need for</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.350" end="00:00:55.789" style="s2">change in favor of making people feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.690" end="00:00:59.210" style="s2">better about themselves is this not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.789" end="00:01:02.449" style="s2">time for righteous anger I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.210" end="00:01:04.220" style="s2">time for righteous anger the the trick</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.449" end="00:01:07.009" style="s2">that the controlling forces of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.220" end="00:01:09.590" style="s2">world have used is that they again and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.009" end="00:01:12.020" style="s2">again divert the righteous anger onto a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.590" end="00:01:13.490" style="s2">false target and onto false solutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.020" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">Charles thank you very much for joining</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.490" end="00:01:18.020" style="s2">me I&#39;m familiar with your work and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s about time we had you on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.020" end="00:01:21.560" style="s2">channel because you write about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.210" end="00:01:23.000" style="s2">the same things that many of the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.560" end="00:01:25.219" style="s2">people we feature on the channel talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.000" end="00:01:27.710" style="s2">about in particular kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.219" end="00:01:30.439" style="s2">change and possible other operating</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.710" end="00:01:32.570" style="s2">systems for the society that we have and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.439" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">also linking it to like personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.570" end="00:01:37.159" style="s2">and personal change at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:39.110" style="s2">given what&#39;s going on right now like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.159" end="00:01:40.939" style="s2">think a lot of people are recognizing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.110" end="00:01:45.350" style="s2">few things one how interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.939" end="00:01:47.539" style="s2">everything is and also how this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.350" end="00:01:49.399" style="s2">idea about alternative operating system</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.539" end="00:01:51.469" style="s2">seems to be coming into a sharp relief</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.399" end="00:01:54.380" style="s2">for a lot of people how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.469" end="00:01:56.420" style="s2">that this current crisis is is showing</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.380" end="00:02:00.579" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of throwing into relief your</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.420" end="00:02:02.869" style="s2">work from before yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.579" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of hard to summarize it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.869" end="00:02:07.939" style="s2">why I that&#39;s why the article ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:10.040" style="s2">being 9,000 words I didn&#39;t try to write</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.939" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">such a long article but there was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.040" end="00:02:17.939" style="s2">so much to say so there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:19.439" style="s2">in it but one of the as far as like how</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.939" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">it relates to my earlier work I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.439" end="00:02:25.769" style="s2">writing about how change happens through</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:28.349" style="s2">crisis even through a process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.769" end="00:02:31.739" style="s2">initiation where the old normal falls</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.349" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">apart where we recognize finally that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.739" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">reality is not what we had fought it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:39.780" style="s2">be and that therefore we ourselves are</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:43.439" style="s2">not who we thought ourselves to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.780" end="00:02:47.099" style="s2">because self and reality are inter</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.439" end="00:02:49.370" style="s2">interwoven we&#39;re not just separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.099" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">selves floating in an external reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.370" end="00:02:54.870" style="s2">but our relationships are part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">ourselves in fact you could even say</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.870" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">that we are relationship and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:03:00.719" style="s2">of the realizations that&#39;s coming out as</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">you were saying that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.719" end="00:03:06.659" style="s2">interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">you know through the kovat crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.659" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like the things that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.090" end="00:03:21.629" style="s2">foreseeing and also fearing are all</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">coming together at once so on the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.629" end="00:03:28.349" style="s2">hand the breakdown of normal that gives</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">us an opportunity to choose what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.349" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">been unconsciously choosing before like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:36.540" style="s2">unconscious choices are are being</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">brought into our attention and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.540" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">we&#39;re being asked do we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.689" style="s2">going in the direction we&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:44.579" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that kovat is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.689" end="00:03:47.669" style="s2">rescue us from the path that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.579" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">on but it&#39;s at least putting us into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.669" end="00:03:55.799" style="s2">into a liminal zone where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">reinforcing circumstances of our old way</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.799" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">of life are temporarily dispelled and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:05.849" style="s2">can say yeah do we really want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:08.759" style="s2">continue down the road of separation one</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.849" end="00:04:11.699" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s that&#39;s being shown</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.759" end="00:04:14.759" style="s2">to us like none of the none of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.699" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">responses to coronavirus are anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.759" end="00:04:19.880" style="s2">new there are all intensification of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">trends that have gone on for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.880" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">for example the migration of social</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:30.600" style="s2">interaction on to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">like that has been happening for 20</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.600" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">years at least now we&#39;re forced to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:42.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s taken to an extreme or the or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:47.420" style="s2">the movement of Commerce online or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.440" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">regime of Hygiene and the fear of germs</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.420" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">or the movement of life indoors when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">was a kid we there were packs of kids</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:04:59.810" style="s2">outside playing all the time and now and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">and to be kept indoors was a punishment</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.810" end="00:05:04.380" style="s2">like you&#39;re not allowed to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.840" style="s2">play now it&#39;s kind of the opposite and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.380" end="00:05:09.750" style="s2">this did not all of a sudden happen with</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.840" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">coronavirus or the restriction of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.750" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">political freedoms the censorship of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:19.169" style="s2">information the destruction of small</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:22.070" style="s2">businesses like all of these things the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.169" end="00:05:24.090" style="s2">the increasing medicalization of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.070" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">all of these things were already</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.090" end="00:05:29.730" style="s2">happening and now we get to ask do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">want them to continue to happening when</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">we&#39;re being shown what they are like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">taken to the extreme my hope is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:43.530" style="s2">we&#39;ll say no we don&#39;t want to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.310" end="00:05:47.130" style="s2">everything for the holy cause of risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.530" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">minimization maybe we will accept a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.130" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">more risk except that death is part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:57.479" style="s2">life and no longer live in this regime</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">of control that seeks to to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.479" end="00:06:02.520" style="s2">risk control every variable guard</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:05.870" style="s2">against the world guard against each</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.520" end="00:06:09.900" style="s2">other and therefore not even really live</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.870" end="00:06:11.729" style="s2">in an in an attempt to forestall death I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.900" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">was struck by one of the metaphors that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.729" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">you used in your article cuz I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.419" style="s2">it a few times now and it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">addict rehab metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.419" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">and I think it comes up a lot people</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">over it seems to illustrate things very</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:27.450" style="s2">well this sort of idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:28.979" style="s2">sort of delusional way of being that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.450" end="00:06:32.070" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re now being confronted with</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.979" end="00:06:33.690" style="s2">and there in that there is a choice can</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.070" end="00:06:36.390" style="s2">you unpack that for me how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.690" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">that metaphor being useful yeah so on</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.390" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.830" end="00:06:45.340" style="s2">the one of the approaches to addiction</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.910" end="00:06:48.940" style="s2">is it&#39;s called an intervention where are</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.340" end="00:06:51.520" style="s2">you by force if necessary pluck the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.940" end="00:06:57.160" style="s2">person out of the totality of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.520" end="00:06:58.780" style="s2">circumstances that that make the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.160" end="00:07:00.760" style="s2">addiction happen like the the addiction</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.780" end="00:07:03.760" style="s2">is part of an entire life an entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.760" end="00:07:05.980" style="s2">lifestyle your surroundings and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.760" end="00:07:07.300" style="s2">if nothing else changes then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.980" end="00:07:11.260" style="s2">addiction isn&#39;t going to change either</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:15.130" style="s2">so you intervene and and interrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.260" end="00:07:17.080" style="s2">routines the relationships the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.130" end="00:07:19.690" style="s2">way of life of the addict and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.080" end="00:07:23.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re cured but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.690" end="00:07:27.190" style="s2">means that they have at least a chance</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:29.580" style="s2">to make other changes and to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.190" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">things that the addiction was obscuring</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.580" end="00:07:36.220" style="s2">because addictions kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:38.140" style="s2">temporarily at least they they dull the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.220" end="00:07:42.730" style="s2">pain they&#39;re they in fact they</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.140" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">originated as a coping mechanism and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.730" end="00:07:48.430" style="s2">them and and the problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:50.920" style="s2">price that they take to keep working</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.430" end="00:07:53.710" style="s2">gets greater and greater and greater so</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.920" end="00:07:57.790" style="s2">on a on the on a grand scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.710" end="00:08:03.670" style="s2">I think that we have a society that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.790" end="00:08:06.510" style="s2">itself addicted to control addiction the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.670" end="00:08:09.970" style="s2">things that people use um you know as</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.510" end="00:08:12.910" style="s2">there are pathways of addiction these</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.970" end="00:08:17.290" style="s2">are ways to control life in some way to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.910" end="00:08:22.450" style="s2">control pain to control emotions to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.290" end="00:08:27.370" style="s2">control other people and so forth so our</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.450" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">culture our society let me say responds</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.370" end="00:08:33.520" style="s2">to its problems through various</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:38.580" style="s2">technologies of control or another</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.520" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">example would be the the piling up of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.580" end="00:08:44.100" style="s2">pharmaceutical medications each one</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:47.710" style="s2">causing symptoms that another one is</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.100" end="00:08:51.430" style="s2">added in to address or agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.710" end="00:08:55.390" style="s2">technology where where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.430" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">ders and chemical fertilizers destroy</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.390" end="00:09:02.710" style="s2">the soil and allow pests to proliferate</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.540" style="s2">and so then you add a pesticide and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.710" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">destroys the soil even more so you add</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.540" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">another one and another one and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:11.290" style="s2">soon you&#39;re completely dependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:12.670" style="s2">chemicals so the same pattern or</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.290" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">foreign-policy</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.670" end="00:09:16.750" style="s2">you know there&#39;s terrorists you bomb</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">them or you try to keep them out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:21.339" style="s2">somehow it doesn&#39;t solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:22.779" style="s2">something else happens and you need even</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.339" end="00:09:25.420" style="s2">more and more and more control so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.779" end="00:09:29.290" style="s2">generally the big picture is that our</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.420" end="00:09:30.910" style="s2">society is addicted to control the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.290" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">response every time it doesn&#39;t work is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.910" end="00:09:36.790" style="s2">more of it and just like with an</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:39.790" style="s2">addiction the price that we pay that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.790" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">gouged out of our lives and gouged out</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.790" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">of our souls is greater and greater what</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:46.899" style="s2">is it in America like 15% of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:50.589" style="s2">population or something ridiculous like</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.899" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">that is clinically depressed and another</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.589" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">huge chunk of them or have anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:58.900" style="s2">another huge chunk are addicted etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like half the people have some</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.900" end="00:10:08.850" style="s2">serious psychological disorder and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.070" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">do we do then more control mood altering</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.850" end="00:10:16.450" style="s2">pharmaceutical medicines like will</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:19.660" style="s2">control your very brain but at some</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.450" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">point we need this interruption to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.660" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">hold on here is this working have we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:30.070" style="s2">actually hit bottom like this is showing</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:32.230" style="s2">us where bottom is going to be like what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.070" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">what current trends are taking us toward</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.230" end="00:10:38.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I have hope in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.510" style="s2">crisis as well as a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.950" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">despair and despondency before we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.510" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">started recording you asked me how am i</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">doing you know and like sometimes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:47.890" style="s2">like oh my god everything that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">afraid of is happening now and I see</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.890" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">this timeline going into a dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">future where it becomes normal never to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:59.340" style="s2">leave your house like a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:02.910" style="s2">this country</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.340" end="00:11:04.350" style="s2">haven&#39;t been that disrupted because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.910" end="00:11:05.580" style="s2">were already shopping online for</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.350" end="00:11:08.310" style="s2">everything and everything was getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.580" end="00:11:10.770" style="s2">delivered to their house and not talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.310" end="00:11:12.930" style="s2">to anybody when they went shopping and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.770" end="00:11:14.010" style="s2">now you don&#39;t even need to go shopping</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.930" end="00:11:16.380" style="s2">you can get deliveries to your house</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.010" end="00:11:18.420" style="s2">like why do we even think we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.380" end="00:11:22.350" style="s2">back to normal and how far could it go</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.420" end="00:11:25.770" style="s2">could we see a world where even dating</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.350" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">is online and procreation happens via</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.770" end="00:11:30.210" style="s2">sex robots where you know the sex robot</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:33.030" style="s2">comes to your house and you deposit your</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.210" end="00:11:35.640" style="s2">sperm and then goes to a lab and so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.030" end="00:11:39.300" style="s2">and so forth like like and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.640" end="00:11:44.250" style="s2">predicting that but from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.300" end="00:11:46.010" style="s2">totalitarian nightmare of constant</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.250" end="00:11:50.400" style="s2">surveillance to the nightmare of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.010" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">separation from each other like all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.400" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">these things are happening and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:55.200" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;m like I go through this</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:58.590" style="s2">despondency but it helps me to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.200" end="00:12:04.220" style="s2">that this is also it&#39;s it&#39;s a choice</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.590" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">point making our old trajectory visible</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.220" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">conscious and therefore we can still</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">choose to go that way but maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">an awareness now that we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">choice yeah and you mentioned for</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">example the medicalization crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:21.480" style="s2">American society and let&#39;s not just keep</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:24.300" style="s2">it to America let&#39;s talk about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.480" end="00:12:27.060" style="s2">more worldwide but you use the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.300" end="00:12:29.070" style="s2">in the article of the taut rope which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.060" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">think is quite a good a good one because</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.070" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">what it seems is happening is that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:37.080" style="s2">crisis is showing it&#39;s kind of unveiling</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:39.330" style="s2">a lot of the stress points for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.080" end="00:12:41.460" style="s2">in the economic system where we&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.330" end="00:12:44.100" style="s2">out all of the slack and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.460" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">vulnerable to a shock like this also if</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.100" end="00:12:49.620" style="s2">you look at kind of our immune systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:51.420" style="s2">or the kind of medicalization of so many</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.620" end="00:12:53.160" style="s2">people in America like we&#39;ve taken out</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.420" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">the slack of so many systems and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.160" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">we&#39;ve got weak systems in so many places</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:13:01.230" style="s2">and what it seems is happening is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:03.030" style="s2">this crisis is kind of unveiling or</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.230" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">showing us the kind of stress points in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.030" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">society yeah very fragile everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:11.250" style="s2">very fragile our financial system is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">very fragile like hate me leveraged you</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.250" end="00:13:13.290" style="s2">know so let&#39;s just know as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">no slack</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.290" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">and even our psychologies you know where</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:25.470" style="s2">we&#39;re not resilient the the Hong Kong</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:27.240" style="s2">flu that struck in 1968 killed according</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.470" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">to some estimates four million people</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.240" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">worldwide the population was half that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:34.519" style="s2">said that would be the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:36.860" style="s2">like you know maybe eight million people</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.519" end="00:13:40.500" style="s2">coronavirus has killed what so far</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.860" end="00:13:43.529" style="s2">60,000 maybe hmm like not even in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.500" end="00:13:45.959" style="s2">ballpark and I asked my mother if she</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.529" end="00:13:47.149" style="s2">remembered Hong Kong flu she need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.959" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">remember it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.149" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">nobody was panicking and yeah like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:55.709" style="s2">could say that okay so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.740" end="00:13:57.240" style="s2">interesting question why hmm and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.709" end="00:14:01.910" style="s2">that it&#39;s similar to what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.240" end="00:14:05.790" style="s2">that that we were healthier</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.910" end="00:14:09.329" style="s2">psychologically healthier in that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.790" end="00:14:11.550" style="s2">weren&#39;t so afraid of death and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.329" end="00:14:16.470" style="s2">fixated on preserving youth and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.550" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">preserving life at all costs we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.470" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">psychologically less fragile and socio</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:25.829" style="s2">socially less fragile and now our</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">civilization is just like yeah like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.829" end="00:14:29.250" style="s2">said like this rope that&#39;s pulled</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:31.740" style="s2">tighter and tighter and tighter until it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.250" end="00:14:33.870" style="s2">just takes a little little touch for it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.740" end="00:14:35.420" style="s2">to snap and if it wasn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.870" end="00:14:42.899" style="s2">this it was going to be something else</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.420" end="00:14:48.420" style="s2">so now we&#39;re in it and this is another</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.899" end="00:14:49.949" style="s2">thing just the uncertainty one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.420" end="00:14:51.660" style="s2">things I was saying in the essay is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.949" end="00:14:55.800" style="s2">maybe it is time to release into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.660" end="00:14:59.069" style="s2">uncertainty rather than to try to cling</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.800" end="00:15:00.389" style="s2">to the old normal and to bring normal</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.510" end="00:17:41.099" style="s2">until maybe 20 years ago people would</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.960" end="00:17:58.820" style="s2">but underneath I think there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:05.309" style="s2">working-class people why would you</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.289" end="00:18:19.049" style="s2">marvelous future for us to live in and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.519" end="00:18:21.239" style="s2">it&#39;s just gotten worse not only his</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.419" end="00:18:41.719" style="s2">I mean you know forget like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.629" end="00:18:45.359" style="s2">own your own house or anything like that</p>

<p begin="00:18:45.359" end="00:18:56.929" style="s2">to the to the an extreme so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.940" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">the end of the world as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.929" end="00:19:04.409" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be a bad thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:07.799" style="s2">can be a very bad thing one question I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.409" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">ask is is there a danger of confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.799" end="00:19:12.749" style="s2">bias in that you&#39;ve been writing about</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.070" end="00:19:16.349" style="s2">these things for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.749" end="00:19:18.779" style="s2">now we we have this situation and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.349" end="00:19:21.809" style="s2">danger of saying AHA see I was right all</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.779" end="00:19:23.190" style="s2">along is there a concern there of just</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.809" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">sort of seeing things through a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.190" end="00:19:27.419" style="s2">particular lens that that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:32.339" style="s2">already built up there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.339" end="00:19:39.210" style="s2">how conspiracy narratives are built you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.129" end="00:19:40.769" style="s2">you kind of screen out the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.210" end="00:19:43.469" style="s2">don&#39;t fit the narrative you take in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.769" end="00:19:45.619" style="s2">things that do you interpret things in</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.010" end="00:23:08.920" style="s2">attack it&#39;s an attack of my identity so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.340" end="00:23:16.470" style="s2">it actually takes a bit of courage and</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.920" end="00:23:16.470" style="s2">humility to entertain narratives that</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.500" end="00:23:26.500" style="s2">contradict what you had believed in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2">past and it&#39;s a shock and people going</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.500" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">to denial when when it happens maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:33.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of denial going on right</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">now but denial is a phase you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.790" end="00:23:40.300" style="s2">part of a larger process eventually the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">the denial is harder and harder to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.300" end="00:23:47.380" style="s2">maintain and you enter the next phase</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:50.110" style="s2">ultimately accepting that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.380" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">and that is similar to the acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.110" end="00:23:55.900" style="s2">death actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:58.770" style="s2">it&#39;s the same fear of the unknown fear</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:24:05.740" style="s2">of transcending who you are right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.770" end="00:24:07.900" style="s2">and that fear the fear of death has</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.740" end="00:24:12.280" style="s2">governed our society increasingly for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.900" end="00:24:14.050" style="s2">long time which is inevitable from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.280" end="00:24:16.870" style="s2">story of self that prevails in our</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.770" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you accept being to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.400" end="00:24:28.370" style="s2">then death is the worst possible outcome</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.340" end="00:24:33.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the annihilation of all that is all</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.370" end="00:24:35.059" style="s2">yourself the universe itself and so of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.080" end="00:24:38.710" style="s2">course we have a medical system and an</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.059" end="00:24:43.429" style="s2">entire narrative now that&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.710" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">saving lives yeah you mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.429" end="00:24:49.400" style="s2">article about death aversion and how</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:52.130" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the the dynamics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.400" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">going on and that I think you pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.130" end="00:24:55.790" style="s2">much say that we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">come to terms with what freedoms are we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.790" end="00:25:05.059" style="s2">prepared to forego in exchange for some</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">acceptance of risk would you is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.059" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">about right it&#39;s some a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:18.610" style="s2">conflicting values you know like when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.880" end="00:25:22.070" style="s2">hold life sacred and we hold our beloved</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.610" end="00:25:24.650" style="s2">fellow beings our parents our</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.070" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">grandparents people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.650" end="00:25:29.750" style="s2">immunocompromised I mean these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:32.450" style="s2">are equally sacred and equally worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.750" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">life as anybody else and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.450" end="00:25:36.800" style="s2">value that we should do whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:39.890" style="s2">takes to protect these people like my</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.800" end="00:25:45.290" style="s2">mother is in this category she&#39;s in her</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.890" end="00:25:50.059" style="s2">late 70s she&#39;s had cancer she&#39;s frail if</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.290" end="00:25:55.610" style="s2">she got kovin 19 she would probably die</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.059" end="00:25:57.710" style="s2">and she&#39;s loving life probably you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.610" end="00:25:59.570" style="s2">she just wrote her obituaries the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.710" end="00:26:00.290" style="s2">day like she&#39;s probably not gonna live</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.570" end="00:26:03.890" style="s2">that much longer</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.290" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">um but who knows maybe she&#39;ll be with us</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.890" end="00:26:08.750" style="s2">for several more years and she&#39;s loving</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:11.150" style="s2">every day of her life she&#39;s like oh the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.750" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">sunshine it&#39;s so beautiful you know she</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.150" end="00:26:17.300" style="s2">if she can sit in the sunshine and hear</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:19.640" style="s2">a bird singing she is totally content</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.300" end="00:26:22.280" style="s2">with that every day is precious to her</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.640" end="00:26:24.530" style="s2">and I value that and I want her to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.280" end="00:26:28.340" style="s2">if if if she can have six more months of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.530" end="00:26:31.130" style="s2">that I want that and I&#39;m willing not to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.340" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">visit her for alone fur</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.130" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">this month in order to keep her safe but</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:44.690" style="s2">would I be willing to not visit her for</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.500" end="00:26:46.389" style="s2">six months or a year and what I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.690" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">willing to and maybe never see her again</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.389" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">would that be worth it would I be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:56.630" style="s2">willing to tell the whole world to stop</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">to stop gathering just so that my mother</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.630" end="00:27:01.909" style="s2">can survive no I don&#39;t think so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:05.000" style="s2">think that that&#39;s so there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.909" end="00:27:07.309" style="s2">values here that that it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:08.899" style="s2">trade-off of values like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.309" end="00:27:12.889" style="s2">willing to sacrifice to keep these</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.899" end="00:27:15.080" style="s2">precious ones safe are we willing it you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.889" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">know to practice social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.080" end="00:27:23.419" style="s2">forever if it reduces the death rate and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">in and makes average life expectancy six</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.419" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">months higher I mean a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:29.179" style="s2">are dying of Kovan are you gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:31.580" style="s2">anyway I mean everyone&#39;s gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.179" end="00:27:36.259" style="s2">anyway but you know in Italy for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.580" end="00:27:38.600" style="s2">the median age of death was like 80 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.259" end="00:27:41.720" style="s2">been 80 so that means that half the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.600" end="00:27:44.299" style="s2">people who have died are over 80 well</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.720" end="00:27:48.350" style="s2">life expectancy in Italy is around 80</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.299" end="00:27:51.309" style="s2">anyway so so these people you know on</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.350" end="00:27:54.169" style="s2">average who are who have been dying of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.309" end="00:27:55.700" style="s2">coronavirus could have maybe they had an</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.169" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">average of six months to live anyway or</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.700" end="00:28:04.029" style="s2">who knows you know is is it worth</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:07.340" style="s2">totally changing the way that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.029" end="00:28:09.590" style="s2">order to postpone death a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.340" end="00:28:11.299" style="s2">sometimes it is like there are times</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.590" end="00:28:14.929" style="s2">where I would be like yeah mom I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.299" end="00:28:17.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to visit you because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.929" end="00:28:18.889" style="s2">be over in a few weeks and then I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.450" end="00:28:23.899" style="s2">able to visit you like it&#39;s a worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.889" end="00:28:26.750" style="s2">sacrifice but we have to be clear that a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.899" end="00:28:29.179" style="s2">lot of the rationale for social</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.750" end="00:28:35.779" style="s2">distancing quarantines and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.179" end="00:28:37.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t gonna go away the virus I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.779" end="00:28:39.320" style="s2">okay maybe this virus will subside but</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.610" end="00:28:41.299" style="s2">there&#39;s always a possibility of a mutant</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.320" end="00:28:42.590" style="s2">variation of it or another one or this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.299" end="00:28:45.169" style="s2">the flu</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.590" end="00:28:48.889" style="s2">or there&#39;s always gonna be a reason to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.169" end="00:28:50.299" style="s2">maintain these practices or they say you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.889" end="00:28:52.850" style="s2">can get reinfected with it you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.299" end="00:28:56.419" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s endemic we&#39;re gonna have it</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.850" end="00:28:59.720" style="s2">forever so the questions that come up in</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.419" end="00:29:02.149" style="s2">the short term are the sacrifices worth</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.720" end="00:29:04.309" style="s2">it they&#39;re gonna remain with us in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.149" end="00:29:06.889" style="s2">long term too and it brings up what do</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.309" end="00:29:08.120" style="s2">we value do we value the prolonging of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.889" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">life at any cost</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.120" end="00:29:15.070" style="s2">or do we value play the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.950" end="00:29:16.250" style="s2">our boundaries the challenging of limits</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.070" end="00:29:21.460" style="s2">adventure</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.250" end="00:29:26.470" style="s2">I mean people make choices all the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.460" end="00:29:29.870" style="s2">that are risky like to go to a festival</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.470" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">it&#39;s much safer to stay at home to let</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.870" end="00:29:36.470" style="s2">your kid play out saket it&#39;s much safer</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:37.759" style="s2">to keep them indoors to go to a bar to</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.470" end="00:29:40.820" style="s2">get on the highway I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.759" end="00:29:43.940" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of choices that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.820" end="00:29:49.190" style="s2">make in order to live life fully that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.940" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">put living life longer at risk and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.190" end="00:29:56.539" style="s2">think that this conversation about our</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:58.850" style="s2">values is unavoidable and hitting home</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.539" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">for a lot of people like my friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.850" end="00:30:03.620" style="s2">listen Rankin who&#39;s an MD she&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">do you guys really know it it is like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.620" end="00:30:08.419" style="s2">be on a respirator and she cites these</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">statistics like two-thirds of the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.419" end="00:30:14.289" style="s2">who go on respirators for this die</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:17.000" style="s2">anyway so instead of dying sooner</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.289" end="00:30:19.909" style="s2">surrounded by loved ones they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.000" end="00:30:23.720" style="s2">after several weeks of torture with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.909" end="00:30:27.049" style="s2">machine breathing them in an ICU behind</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.720" end="00:30:30.019" style="s2">glass saying goodbye to their loved ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.049" end="00:30:34.190" style="s2">on FaceTime but they get to live two or</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.019" end="00:30:38.809" style="s2">three weeks longer for a 30% chance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.190" end="00:30:40.909" style="s2">of eventually coming out of that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.809" end="00:30:43.970" style="s2">severely compromised it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.909" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">you&#39;re better cured you know like is</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.970" end="00:30:49.730" style="s2">this conversation even being had the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">medical system is geared around saving</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.730" end="00:30:55.350" style="s2">lives it has no conception of dying well</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.990" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.350" end="00:31:02.910" style="s2">do not keep records of did the patient</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.990" end="00:31:04.470" style="s2">die well it&#39;s only the fatality rate so</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.910" end="00:31:05.250" style="s2">these are just this is just the tip of</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.320" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">having right now and in the the article</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.070" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">you can you kind of as you&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:17.750" style="s2">before you see it as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.620" style="s2">inflection point could it be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.750" end="00:31:22.020" style="s2">transition or the beginning of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.620" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">transition to a better system than the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.020" end="00:31:27.240" style="s2">one we have or could it be could it go</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">the other way and I&#39;ve seen a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.240" end="00:31:31.710" style="s2">criticisms of you I saw Daniel Pinchbeck</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:34.530" style="s2">wrote quite a long one on Facebook that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.710" end="00:31:36.810" style="s2">you responded to and I think his to boil</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.530" end="00:31:38.610" style="s2">his down he was sort of saying that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.810" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">he felt that you were in danger of kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.610" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">of wishful thinking that it was that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:45.960" style="s2">he&#39;s more in the sort of we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">planning actual kind of action we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.960" end="00:31:52.530" style="s2">to be having plans right now and he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:54.600" style="s2">sort of suggesting that you were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.530" end="00:31:56.160" style="s2">making people feel better but not not</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.600" end="00:31:58.410" style="s2">giving them any guidance of what to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.160" end="00:32:02.850" style="s2">in this situation I disagreed with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.410" end="00:32:05.610" style="s2">critique I&#39;m not saying that coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.850" end="00:32:07.410" style="s2">is gonna come and save us you know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.610" end="00:32:09.390" style="s2">it&#39;s delivering us from the situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.410" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been in and automatically</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.390" end="00:32:13.800" style="s2">gonna bring us a better world and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:16.230" style="s2">take comfort you know this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.800" end="00:32:19.790" style="s2">thing I&#39;m what I&#39;m saying is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.230" end="00:32:21.900" style="s2">making our choice starkly apparent to us</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.790" end="00:32:27.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t guarantee we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.900" end="00:32:30.450" style="s2">the right choice but it is showing us</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.470" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">that for one thing like I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.450" end="00:32:34.620" style="s2">before that that normal isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.590" style="s2">necessarily where we want to be it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.620" end="00:32:42.180" style="s2">it&#39;s making our old trajectory starkly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.590" end="00:32:47.610" style="s2">obvious so and and also in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.180" end="00:32:51.420" style="s2">piece I&#39;m offering things like that part</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.610" end="00:32:54.930" style="s2">about about death denial and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.420" end="00:32:56.750" style="s2">other piece is about the the title of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.930" end="00:32:59.820" style="s2">that section was life is community</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.750" end="00:33:01.530" style="s2">saying that that here&#39;s the irony that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.820" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">even the things that we&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.530" end="00:33:06.450" style="s2">prolong life don&#39;t actually necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.890" style="s2">do it the things that we&#39;re doing for</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.450" end="00:33:08.940" style="s2">the sake of health don&#39;t actually make</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.890" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">us healthier</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.940" end="00:33:14.160" style="s2">like excessive hygiene which cuts us off</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:17.520" style="s2">and social distancing which cuts us off</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.160" end="00:33:18.990" style="s2">from the constant interchange with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.520" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">world that&#39;s necessary to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.990" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">healthy immune system a healthy got gut</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">biome and so forth so yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:31.610" style="s2">saying okay therefore you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:36.420" style="s2">have here&#39;s my plan for a big program to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.610" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">introduce more probiotics into the diet</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.420" end="00:33:40.440" style="s2">and get our hands dirty again and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:43.800" style="s2">forth but I think that that&#39;s implicit</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.440" end="00:33:47.250" style="s2">in what I&#39;m saying when we take in more</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.800" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">information then our choices change and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.250" end="00:33:55.530" style="s2">what we recognize as possible changes so</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:57.090" style="s2">that&#39;s and I think that as well if we</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.530" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">don&#39;t accept the opportunity that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.090" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">being offered to take a step back and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">take in more data points and survey the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.490" style="s2">situation from a larger perspective then</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:06.870" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be trapped in patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.490" end="00:34:10.770" style="s2">response that are actually a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.870" end="00:34:13.980" style="s2">problem and the main pattern of response</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.770" end="00:34:16.410" style="s2">is a bad things happening let&#39;s find</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.980" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">something to kill let&#39;s find something</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.410" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">to control let&#39;s find something to keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:25.290" style="s2">out let&#39;s keep our world safe our world</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:29.910" style="s2">of separation safe it&#39;s the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.290" end="00:34:32.310" style="s2">thinking applied to coronavirus as is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.910" end="00:34:34.830" style="s2">applied to you know immigration or</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.310" end="00:34:37.730" style="s2">terrorism or a crime how do we keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.830" end="00:34:40.710" style="s2">ourselves safe from these bad guys that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.730" end="00:34:44.370" style="s2">pattern of thought needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.710" end="00:34:48.540" style="s2">interrupted we need to to take a pause</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.370" end="00:34:50.820" style="s2">and we&#39;re being offered that not that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.540" end="00:34:54.210" style="s2">the pause is magically gonna change</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.820" end="00:34:57.480" style="s2">things but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.210" end="00:35:01.860" style="s2">I&#39;m saying let&#39;s take in the full</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.480" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">spectrum of information let&#39;s let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.860" end="00:35:07.320" style="s2">what happens when the unconscious is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:09.720" style="s2">brought into visibility into</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.320" end="00:35:12.690" style="s2">consciousness yeah I guess I guess sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.720" end="00:35:15.390" style="s2">of following that thread my concern I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.690" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">spoke to Joe Brewer the other day who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.390" end="00:35:20.130" style="s2">kind of got a name for himself as he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">complexity theorist and and looks at</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.130" end="00:35:27.150" style="s2">cognitive science and cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:29.250" style="s2">and he said we know that the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.150" end="00:35:31.350" style="s2">more Machiavellian maybe the people</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.250" end="00:35:33.810" style="s2">trying to defend the old regime the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.350" end="00:35:36.090" style="s2">sort of sociopathic tendencies will be</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.810" end="00:35:37.890" style="s2">activating right now they will be kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.090" end="00:35:41.040" style="s2">of looking at how they like disaster</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.890" end="00:35:42.990" style="s2">capitalism Naomi Klein&#39;s idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.040" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">know they will be doing stuff how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.990" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">and people who are writing books like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:51.900" style="s2">better world their hearts know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:53.880" style="s2">possible how do we compete with those</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.900" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">people with the knowing that there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.880" end="00:35:57.540" style="s2">kind of really ruthless people out there</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:35:59.910" style="s2">looking for control of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.540" end="00:36:01.260" style="s2">that there is a concern there isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.910" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">um and so what I look at is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">ground conditions that allow those</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:15.450" style="s2">people to even prey on the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:19.620" style="s2">what makes the totalitarian response to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.450" end="00:36:20.460" style="s2">coronavirus so compelling that people go</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.620" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">along with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.460" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">what makes the war on germs so</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:31.650" style="s2">compelling like because these</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:33.930" style="s2">psychopaths in power they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.650" end="00:36:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they&#39;re superhuman it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.930" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">not like they have a mind control ray</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.600" end="00:36:40.890" style="s2">necessarily their power comes because</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.980" style="s2">everyone goes along with it that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.890" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">get down to the governing stories of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.980" end="00:36:49.290" style="s2">civilization the story of separation the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:51.090" style="s2">story of ascent that human destiny is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.290" end="00:36:53.550" style="s2">rise above nature the story of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.550" end="00:37:02.970" style="s2">comes from that like once you accept all</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.920" end="00:37:06.420" style="s2">of these basic things then malignant</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.970" end="00:37:09.030" style="s2">powers can leverage those they can</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.420" end="00:37:11.850" style="s2">leverage the fear they can leverage the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.030" end="00:37:14.670" style="s2">they can they can play divide and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.850" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">conquer if you are pretty so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.670" end="00:37:18.420" style="s2">a good example if you are predisposed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:23.480" style="s2">diagnose a problem as being caused by a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.420" end="00:37:26.460" style="s2">bad guy by an enemy then a manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.480" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">reader can come and say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.460" end="00:37:31.080" style="s2">problem it&#39;s those enemies and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:33.150" style="s2">a where this is war and so you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.080" end="00:37:34.780" style="s2">have to make some sacrifices to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.150" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">bad guys out</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.780" end="00:37:39.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what Goering said it at Nuremberg</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:40.690" style="s2">you know that yeah it&#39;s easy to get the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.100" end="00:37:41.800" style="s2">population to go along just proclaim</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.690" end="00:37:43.570" style="s2">that there&#39;s an enemy and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.800" end="00:37:45.340" style="s2">out the gates and that we that if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.570" end="00:37:48.190" style="s2">don&#39;t go along with it you&#39;re a traitor</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.190" end="00:37:55.210" style="s2">standard operating procedure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.070" end="00:37:59.370" style="s2">and we have in our civilizational myths</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.210" end="00:38:03.100" style="s2">and narratives fertile ground for such</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.370" end="00:38:06.760" style="s2">manipulations to take root and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.100" end="00:38:11.650" style="s2">antidote to that is solidarity the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.760" end="00:38:13.420" style="s2">antidote to that is a new story a story</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.650" end="00:38:17.100" style="s2">of interconnection and interbeing</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.420" end="00:38:21.070" style="s2">that says yeah is it really an enemy or</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.100" end="00:38:23.650" style="s2">let&#39;s question that how am i part of the</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.740" end="00:46:34.690" style="s2">I mean I could give many examples of of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.310" end="00:46:41.990" style="s2">the obscene juxtaposition of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.690" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">overabundance and poverty so yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.990" end="00:46:53.230" style="s2">we should embrace the anger because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:47:00.110" style="s2">is valid it points to a violation but to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.230" end="00:47:03.260" style="s2">then say but yeah to offer too hasty a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.110" end="00:47:09.400" style="s2">target for that anger risks replicating</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.260" end="00:47:13.550" style="s2">that pattern of diffusing it by by</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.400" end="00:47:15.410" style="s2">diverting it onto of a false target the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.550" end="00:47:17.810" style="s2">people who look like they are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.410" end="00:47:20.060" style="s2">perpetrators they are functionaries</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.810" end="00:47:22.700" style="s2">actually they are playing a role that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.060" end="00:47:26.600" style="s2">systemic Lee necessary and if we put</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.700" end="00:47:28.310" style="s2">their heads on on spikes guess what new</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.600" end="00:47:29.990" style="s2">people are gonna come and do the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.310" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">thing that the old people did so Wes</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.990" end="00:47:33.640" style="s2">have the right to sang to be targeted</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.890" end="00:47:50.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not even sure if targeted is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.750" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">right way to think about it the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.470" end="00:47:59.860" style="s2">righteous anger ideally will flush out</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:48:03.370" style="s2">the truth it should never be satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.860" end="00:48:06.310" style="s2">with a false explanation it should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.370" end="00:48:09.910" style="s2">vigilant it should say anytime that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.310" end="00:48:13.030" style="s2">being offered a channel it should say</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.910" end="00:48:17.050" style="s2">really are you sure because I&#39;m mad and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.030" end="00:48:21.550" style="s2">I want it to change I don&#39;t want to to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.050" end="00:48:24.610" style="s2">run off in a mob and you know find some</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.550" end="00:48:28.330" style="s2">scapegoats and string them up and not</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.610" end="00:48:30.840" style="s2">change anything like that&#39;s that all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.330" end="00:48:34.350" style="s2">that is a betrayal of the anger actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.840" end="00:48:37.660" style="s2">so even the idea of find a target for it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.350" end="00:48:40.810" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the trick that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.660" end="00:48:43.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the diversion it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.810" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">that things don&#39;t need to change but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.120" end="00:48:47.260" style="s2">asks what needs to change so that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">conditions that generated this betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.260" end="00:48:53.880" style="s2">and this violation no longer exist and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:57.480" style="s2">it could be that the best route to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.880" end="00:49:02.590" style="s2">involves compassion and forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.480" end="00:49:05.860" style="s2">those these are not the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.590" end="00:49:09.090" style="s2">anger they are the result of the truth</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.860" end="00:49:12.730" style="s2">that anger can flush to the surface and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.090" end="00:49:16.930" style="s2">this is yeah this is deep deep work here</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.730" end="00:49:24.060" style="s2">but the anger is what can can keep us on</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:29.020" style="s2">point and not be satisfied with sobs</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.060" end="00:49:32.050" style="s2">with with booby prizes and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.020" end="00:49:35.050" style="s2">brings us back to the idea that we sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.050" end="00:49:37.930" style="s2">of hinted at before that it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.050" end="00:49:39.430" style="s2">that the orthodoxy like what it seems is</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.930" end="00:49:41.560" style="s2">happening as far as I can see right now</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.430" end="00:49:43.810" style="s2">you look at sort of the financial system</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.560" end="00:49:46.660" style="s2">we might be seeing kind of a bailout to</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.810" end="00:49:50.590" style="s2">dwarf 2008 we&#39;re seeing a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.660" end="00:49:52.780" style="s2">same kind of thinking just being doubled</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.590" end="00:49:56.500" style="s2">down on again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.780" end="00:49:58.510" style="s2">sort of sense that it the system is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.500" end="00:50:00.280" style="s2">reacting in the only way that it knows</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.510" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">but it seems to be doubling down on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.280" end="00:50:07.000" style="s2">same kind of thinking and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">methods that created some of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.000" end="00:50:11.860" style="s2">systemic crises in the first place can</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.110" style="s2">you speak to that cuz I think you talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.860" end="00:50:17.470" style="s2">about that in your essay there is also</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.110" end="00:50:19.480" style="s2">signs of I mean in America there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.470" end="00:50:23.710" style="s2">moratorium on foreclosures and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.480" end="00:50:25.600" style="s2">addictions and that so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.710" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">that actually does help the common</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.600" end="00:50:31.960" style="s2">people what we should be advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:34.660" style="s2">in terms of a bailout is what I call it</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.960" end="00:50:40.180" style="s2">debtors bailout as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.660" end="00:50:42.310" style="s2">creditors bailout in after 28 20 2008</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.180" end="00:50:45.070" style="s2">after that financial crisis we had a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.310" end="00:50:49.420" style="s2">creditors bailout where the the Fed and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.070" end="00:50:53.820" style="s2">the Treasury basically bought up all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.420" end="00:50:55.660" style="s2">the troubled assets which are what like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.820" end="00:50:57.550" style="s2">fundamentally they were troubled because</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.660" end="00:51:01.540" style="s2">people couldn&#39;t make their payments on</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.550" end="00:51:03.580" style="s2">their mortgages so they were bought up</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.540" end="00:51:06.010" style="s2">but did people have to stop making their</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.580" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2">payments no people had to continue the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.010" end="00:51:11.740" style="s2">debts all stayed on the books an</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:15.430" style="s2">alternative strategy would be to buy</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.740" end="00:51:18.130" style="s2">them up so that the banks yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.430" end="00:51:21.660" style="s2">made whole the banks do get bailed out</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.130" end="00:51:25.000" style="s2">but then the debts get forgiven and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.660" end="00:51:29.320" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing some some stirrings of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.000" end="00:51:32.350" style="s2">actually to maybe forgive some portion</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.320" end="00:51:38.530" style="s2">of student debt ultimately though the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.350" end="00:51:41.260" style="s2">only way I think to resolve the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.530" end="00:51:45.600" style="s2">increasing inequality that we have today</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.260" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">is through some kind of debt Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.600" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">that is profoundly radical because it it</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:02.830" style="s2">redresses or it reverses a legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:05.170" style="s2">oppression and inequality even going</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.830" end="00:52:07.450" style="s2">back to slavery even going back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.170" end="00:52:12.190" style="s2">to colonialism and indentured servitude</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.450" end="00:52:18.910" style="s2">and so forth and kind of wipes the slate</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.190" end="00:52:20.740" style="s2">clean so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.910" end="00:52:23.140" style="s2">thing I would like to bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.740" end="00:52:25.960" style="s2">into the awareness and I&#39;m seeing it a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.140" end="00:52:29.140" style="s2">little bit a debt some kind of debt</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.960" end="00:52:30.339" style="s2">forgiveness like I mean this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.140" end="00:52:31.960" style="s2">the righteous anger like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.339" end="00:52:37.960" style="s2">recognition that I&#39;m not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.960" end="00:52:40.329" style="s2">live my life in hock to the banks like</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.960" end="00:52:41.829" style="s2">people you know graduate and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.329" end="00:52:44.260" style="s2">you know in this country it&#39;s especially</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.829" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">severe but levels of debt are rising</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.260" end="00:52:52.089" style="s2">everywhere like my life is not my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:57.069" style="s2">I owe my productive capacity to these</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.089" end="00:52:58.809" style="s2">distant distant institutions people you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.069" end="00:53:00.069" style="s2">know graduate from school with with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.809" end="00:53:01.510" style="s2">sometimes hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.069" end="00:53:05.470" style="s2">dollars in debt that they&#39;ll never pay</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.510" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">off their entire lives your labor is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.470" end="00:53:11.230" style="s2">your own and of course we&#39;re angry about</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.230" end="00:53:18.759" style="s2">when one or two generations before you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:20.950" style="s2">could have a working class job support a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.759" end="00:53:23.650" style="s2">family like you needn&#39;t have to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.950" end="00:53:25.750" style="s2">both parents working you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.650" end="00:53:28.990" style="s2">working class job support a family save</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.750" end="00:53:31.869" style="s2">money buy or have your own house</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.990" end="00:53:32.980" style="s2">eventually own it free and clear you</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.869" end="00:53:36.329" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to be in the elite to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.980" end="00:53:40.630" style="s2">that why can&#39;t we do that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.329" end="00:53:42.789" style="s2">have we regressed technologically have</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.630" end="00:53:46.150" style="s2">we lost our ability to build houses as</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.789" end="00:53:48.730" style="s2">well no we should be richer it should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.150" end="00:53:51.069" style="s2">even more accessible than it was two</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.730" end="00:53:53.710" style="s2">generations ago but it&#39;s the opposite so</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.069" end="00:53:55.150" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s something to be angry about</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.710" end="00:53:58.569" style="s2">and that would be to answer your earlier</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.150" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">question a target a debt Jubilee is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.569" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">a target it&#39;s not someone who that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:09.789" style="s2">can punish for our oppression it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:11.829" style="s2">something that that removes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.789" end="00:54:15.940" style="s2">conditions under which we&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.829" end="00:54:17.230" style="s2">violated yeah my last question is kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.940" end="00:54:18.370" style="s2">of summarizes some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.230" end="00:54:22.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve asked already which</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.370" end="00:54:24.730" style="s2">is how do we live and lead into that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.630" end="00:54:28.630" style="s2">better world that our hearts know as</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.730" end="00:54:30.280" style="s2">possible when in so many areas we sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.630" end="00:54:30.970" style="s2">of feel our hearts bleeding and we see</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.280" end="00:54:35.650" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.970" end="00:54:37.030" style="s2">burning yeah the title is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.650" end="00:54:40.600" style="s2">more beautiful world our hearts know as</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.030" end="00:54:42.580" style="s2">possible and you know the the word</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.600" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">beautiful was I chose that quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.580" end="00:54:47.050" style="s2">purposefully as a different word ent in</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:54.940" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.050" end="00:55:03.190" style="s2">in contrast to efficiency and the cult</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.940" end="00:55:05.890" style="s2">of quantity that governs our society and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.190" end="00:55:14.860" style="s2">I would just offer that as as an</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.890" end="00:55:17.850" style="s2">orientation and it plays into even you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.860" end="00:55:22.110" style="s2">know decisions about life and death</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.850" end="00:55:28.390" style="s2">quantity says how many years can I live</p>

<p begin="00:55:28.390" end="00:55:32.760" style="s2">provokes questions of why am I here to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.140" end="00:55:37.930" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.760" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna survive life I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.930" end="00:55:43.390" style="s2">have that on my gravestone</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:46.990" style="s2">he made it till now you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.390" end="00:55:49.180" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an illusion that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.990" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">living in essentially that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.180" end="00:56:00.250" style="s2">live forever when that illusion is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.680" end="00:56:04.270" style="s2">dissolved we can be in truth what comes</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.250" end="00:56:10.450" style="s2">from that is unique to each person but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.270" end="00:56:12.520" style="s2">think that as a society if we are able</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.450" end="00:56:18.940" style="s2">to release that delusion which on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.520" end="00:56:23.650" style="s2">collective level is you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.940" end="00:56:26.620" style="s2">that we are here to transcend nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.650" end="00:56:28.900" style="s2">that other beings don&#39;t matter that our</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.620" end="00:56:30.730" style="s2">own survival is the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.900" end="00:56:31.670" style="s2">I mean this even gets into environmental</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.730" end="00:56:33.140" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.670" end="00:56:35.559" style="s2">when we say well we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.140" end="00:56:37.849" style="s2">change now otherwise we won&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.559" end="00:56:42.200" style="s2">and I&#39;m like well what if we can survive</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.849" end="00:56:44.599" style="s2">on a concrete world where we grow our</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.200" end="00:56:49.010" style="s2">food in these vats and hydroponics</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.599" end="00:56:51.020" style="s2">factories and and modulate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.010" end="00:56:52.579" style="s2">atmosphere with carbon sucking machines</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.020" end="00:56:53.329" style="s2">you know what if we can survive is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.579" end="00:56:55.730" style="s2">why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.329" end="00:56:57.950" style="s2">is that is that the most beautiful world</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.730" end="00:57:00.230" style="s2">that we can imagine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.950" end="00:57:04.040" style="s2">maybe according to everything measurable</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.230" end="00:57:06.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll be fine we&#39;ll have more gigabytes</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.040" end="00:57:08.630" style="s2">of downloads per person more bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.200" end="00:57:13.460" style="s2">per person more life expectancy per</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.630" end="00:57:17.530" style="s2">person higher GDP per capita but when we</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.460" end="00:57:21.079" style="s2">when we reduce life to quantity then the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.530" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">qualitative gets left out and this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.079" end="00:57:29.299" style="s2">another addiction when the qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.010" end="00:57:31.069" style="s2">is missing like intimacy and beauty then</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.299" end="00:57:36.440" style="s2">we need more and more stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.069" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">compensate for it I&#39;m not sure what your</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.440" end="00:57:47.510" style="s2">question was or if I&#39;ve answered it but</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:53.030" style="s2">a brush with death can resurrect these</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.510" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">lost truths and I&#39;m I&#39;m holding that out</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.030" end="00:57:58.990" style="s2">as a potential outcome of for</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:58:01.339" style="s2">coronavirus that it is bringing death</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.990" end="00:58:05.750" style="s2">into our you know putting it death in</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.339" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">our faces and thereby resurrecting these</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.750" end="00:58:11.720" style="s2">questions of what is in fact a good life</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:15.230" style="s2">and why are we trying to preserve life</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.720" end="00:58:18.859" style="s2">at all costs rather than celebrate life</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.230" end="00:58:27.020" style="s2">and live life fully live it beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.859" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">not just little long why am I here am I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.020" end="00:58:30.619" style="s2">here just to survive and reproduce and</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.510" end="00:59:35.800" style="s2">when death shows us how precious life is</p>

<p begin="00:59:35.800" end="00:59:42.810" style="s2">and our society doesn&#39;t get that we</p>
