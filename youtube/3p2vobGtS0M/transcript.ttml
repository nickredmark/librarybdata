<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">for for many of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">audience you know you&#39;re old enough so</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">that the fall of the Berlin Wall was</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">well that was part of your life you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:50.490" style="s2">that was really the end of the Second</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">World War let&#39;s say and in a technical</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.490" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">sense and it was very meaningful but</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">there&#39;s mean a lot of people born since</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">then and it&#39;s ancient history and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">don&#39;t have that many good bad examples</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:10.400" style="s2">left you know there&#39;s North Korea</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">there&#39;s Venezuela but we&#39;re not locked</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.400" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">tooth and nail in a war with you know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">a proxy war and a cold war with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">Soviet Union and and it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:25.180" style="s2">understand why people are emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:29.349" style="s2">drawn to the ideals of socialism let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.180" end="00:02:31.930" style="s2">the left because it draws on it draws</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.349" end="00:02:35.560" style="s2">its fundamental motivational source from</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:38.859" style="s2">a kind of primary compassion and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.560" end="00:02:42.939" style="s2">always there in human beings and so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.859" end="00:02:46.060" style="s2">proclivity for sensitivity to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.939" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">political message will never go away and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.060" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">so and it&#39;s important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:56.109" style="s2">you have to give the devil his due</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:58.180" style="s2">unfortunately you you&#39;ve also said that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.109" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">people aren&#39;t as resentful at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.180" end="00:03:02.680" style="s2">success of others as we might think and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:04.090" style="s2">I think as you watch a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.680" end="00:03:05.799" style="s2">being interviewed today and you watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.090" end="00:03:07.510" style="s2">some of the students being interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.799" end="00:03:08.530" style="s2">you saw some of the ones up here you</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.510" end="00:03:10.180" style="s2">hear people talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.530" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">inequality but you say they really</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.180" end="00:03:15.459" style="s2">aren&#39;t as resentful as we might think as</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.000" end="00:03:17.319" style="s2">long as they don&#39;t think the game is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.459" end="00:03:18.849" style="s2">fixed yes well that&#39;s certainly the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.319" end="00:03:21.189" style="s2">well first of all I mean if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.849" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">the psychological literature to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.189" end="00:03:26.260" style="s2">degree that it&#39;s accurate which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:30.430" style="s2">difficult to ascertain often people</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.260" end="00:03:34.930" style="s2">report far more prejudice against their</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.430" end="00:03:36.909" style="s2">group that against themselves so so</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.930" end="00:03:40.569" style="s2">that&#39;s quite an interesting phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.909" end="00:03:43.900" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.569" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">tendency for people to exaggerate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.900" end="00:03:49.090" style="s2">degree to which the group they belong to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">it has is currently suffering from from</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.090" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">generalized oppression</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:59.859" style="s2">they&#39;ve been relatively free of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:04:02.409" style="s2">themselves I also think that if fairness</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.859" end="00:04:04.379" style="s2">isn&#39;t absolutely essential and perceived</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.409" end="00:04:09.159" style="s2">fairness is an absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.379" end="00:04:12.509" style="s2">component of peace because people can</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.159" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">tolerate inequality so to speak or even</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.509" end="00:04:19.780" style="s2">revel in it let&#39;s say if they believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.930" end="00:04:21.669" style="s2">that the unequal outcome is deserved I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.780" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">mean look at how people respond to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.669" end="00:04:29.099" style="s2">sports heroes you know everyone no one</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">goes to a sports event and boos the star</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.099" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">even though he or she is paid much</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:37.540" style="s2">better and attracts the lion&#39;s share of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">the attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.540" end="00:04:43.660" style="s2">hopefully not into narcissistic manner</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">people can celebrate success but they do</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.660" end="00:04:49.960" style="s2">have to believe that the game is fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:51.700" style="s2">and and and the game needs to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.960" end="00:04:54.250" style="s2">because otherwise the hierarchy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.700" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">tyrannical the problem with the radical</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.250" end="00:04:57.610" style="s2">left is that it assumes that all</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.290" style="s2">hierarchies are too radical and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.610" end="00:05:02.020" style="s2">no distinction between them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.290" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">an absolute catastrophe because you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:09.340" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of sins let&#39;s say on the</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.340" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">civilization but you can&#39;t throw the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.580" end="00:05:18.520" style="s2">baby out with the bathwater and there</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">are far worse places like all the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.520" end="00:05:23.980" style="s2">places for example that there have ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:25.570" style="s2">been well it&#39;s the case and people also</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.980" end="00:05:27.880" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that and they also</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.570" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">don&#39;t understand this is something</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.880" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">that&#39;s of particular importance they</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">also don&#39;t understand and that that may</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">even characterize you in this audience</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:42.280" style="s2">it&#39;s very the knowledge of how rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:44.980" style="s2">we&#39;re making economic improvements</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.280" end="00:05:47.590" style="s2">around the world in the developing world</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.980" end="00:05:53.260" style="s2">for example how fast that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.590" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">that is not well distributed knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.260" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">you know that between the year 2000 and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">the year 2012 the rate of absolute</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:07.720" style="s2">poverty in the world fell by 50%</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">now it&#39;s a UN figure dollar 90 a day</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.720" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">that was their cutoff for absolute</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:14.530" style="s2">poverty and so the cynics have said well</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:16.630" style="s2">you know that&#39;s pretty low barrier it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.530" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">not such an achievement to have attained</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.630" end="00:06:20.140" style="s2">that I can tell you it&#39;s an achievement</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:21.640" style="s2">to obtain that if you were living on</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.140" end="00:06:24.010" style="s2">less than a dollar a ninety a day to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.640" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">begin with but if you look at if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.010" end="00:06:28.750" style="s2">double the amount to 380 or you double</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:31.900" style="s2">it again to 760 you find the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.750" end="00:06:33.450" style="s2">pattern I mean the poor in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.900" end="00:06:37.060" style="s2">getting rich at a rate that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">absolutely unparalleled in all of human</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.060" end="00:06:41.410" style="s2">history and I think I think a large part</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.150" style="s2">of that large part of that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.410" end="00:06:46.780" style="s2">in Africa where by the way here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.150" end="00:06:48.820" style="s2">another lovely piece of news the child</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:50.030" style="s2">mortality rate in Africa is now the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.820" end="00:06:53.450" style="s2">as it was in Europe and</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.090" end="00:07:33.560" style="s2">is that things are changing so fast that</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.230" end="00:07:40.640" style="s2">example that most of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.970" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">economic news and even a substantial</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.090" style="s2">way was positive until I started to work</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.290" end="00:07:49.370" style="s2">on a UN Committee about five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.090" end="00:07:52.460" style="s2">on sustainable economic development and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.370" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">I read very widely economically and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.460" end="00:07:59.980" style="s2">also ecologically and realized that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:08:03.980" style="s2">things were way better than I had any</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.980" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">any sense of that that that these</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.980" end="00:08:09.050" style="s2">improvements had come at a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:11.690" style="s2">rate and and but you see pardon so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.050" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">partly it is just that it&#39;s so new that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.690" end="00:08:18.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t know and we don&#39;t have a story</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:21.020" style="s2">about it and and and and and who is who</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.350" end="00:08:23.180" style="s2">who would be driving the communication</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.020" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">of such things especially given two</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.180" end="00:08:30.620" style="s2">other things one is that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:32.740" style="s2">are tilted towards negative emotion in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.620" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">terms of its potency and so for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.740" end="00:08:40.790" style="s2">people would rather they much they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:42.950" style="s2">much less happy to lose five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.790" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">than they are happy to gain five dollars</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.950" end="00:08:47.030" style="s2">we&#39;re loss averse or we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.950" style="s2">sensitive to negative emotion than we</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.030" end="00:08:51.290" style="s2">are to positive emotion and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.950" end="00:08:53.810" style="s2">reason for that and the reason is well</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.290" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">you can only be so happy but you can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.810" end="00:08:59.930" style="s2">dead and right and I mean dead is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:02.450" style="s2">not good and and there can be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.930" end="00:09:03.530" style="s2">misery on the way to that end and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.450" end="00:09:06.890" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.530" end="00:09:08.510" style="s2">were tilted to protect ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.890" end="00:09:10.220" style="s2">that makes us more interested in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.510" end="00:09:12.500" style="s2">sense and more easily captivated by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.220" end="00:09:14.360" style="s2">negative than by the positive and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.500" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a hard bias to fight and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.360" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">then when you also take into account and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:20.180" style="s2">I think this is something that&#39;s Sarat</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.200" end="00:09:21.740" style="s2">worth seriously considering because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.180" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">other thing we don&#39;t understand is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">technological revolution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">occurring in every form of media no one</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.700" style="s2">understands it and but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:35.090" style="s2">consequences is is that the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.700" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">media so to speak is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.090" end="00:09:39.350" style="s2">desperate for attention right there</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:41.980" style="s2">exist in a shrinking market with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">shrinking margins all of the leading</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.980" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">newspapers and magazines are feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:48.590" style="s2">pinch</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:50.780" style="s2">television is dead you because YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.590" end="00:09:54.590" style="s2">has everything the television has and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.780" end="00:09:57.530" style="s2">then an incredible array of additional</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.590" end="00:09:59.810" style="s2">features and radio is being replaced by</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.530" end="00:10:03.110" style="s2">podcasts and so it&#39;s very unstable time</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.810" end="00:10:05.720" style="s2">for the mainstream media and what would</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.110" end="00:10:07.970" style="s2">you expect them to do except to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.720" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">whatever they can to attract attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.970" end="00:10:13.070" style="s2">in whatever manner they can manage one</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:15.590" style="s2">example of this one very good example of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.070" end="00:10:17.960" style="s2">this is you may or may not know that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.590" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">rates of violent crime in the United</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.960" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">States and and actually in most places</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:25.520" style="s2">have have plummeted in the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:28.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really quite remarkable the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.520" end="00:10:29.960" style="s2">United States is now safer and in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.190" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">of violent crime than it has been since</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.960" end="00:10:36.610" style="s2">the early 60s and that was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:39.350" style="s2">safest time there ever was but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.610" end="00:10:43.670" style="s2">degree to which violent crime has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.350" end="00:10:46.130" style="s2">reported has increased it&#39;s funny the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.670" end="00:10:47.960" style="s2">curves are almost completely opposite to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.130" end="00:10:49.850" style="s2">one another this is the decline in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.960" end="00:10:52.460" style="s2">violent crime this is the increase in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.850" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">the reporting of violent crime and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.460" end="00:10:56.990" style="s2">reason for that is well people read</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">stories about violent crime and then of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.990" end="00:11:00.500" style="s2">course they&#39;re much more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s on the increase and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.500" end="00:11:03.470" style="s2">the people who are most likely to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:05.270" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s on the increase by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.470" end="00:11:08.780" style="s2">way are also those who are least likely</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.270" end="00:11:10.940" style="s2">to be affected by it because you know to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.780" end="00:11:12.860" style="s2">be a victim of a violent crime what</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.940" end="00:11:14.840" style="s2">helps to drink too much but it also</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.860" end="00:11:17.059" style="s2">helps a lot to be young and male and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.840" end="00:11:18.529" style="s2">that those aren&#39;t the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.059" end="00:11:19.699" style="s2">particularly afraid of violent crime</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.529" end="00:11:22.429" style="s2">even though they&#39;re the ones most likely</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.699" end="00:11:24.609" style="s2">to be implicated in it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.429" end="00:11:26.449" style="s2">technological reasons for our our</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.609" end="00:11:28.249" style="s2">concentration on the negative and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.449" end="00:11:34.699" style="s2">they&#39;re complex it&#39;s not easy to figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.249" end="00:11:38.539" style="s2">out how to combat the spiral of outrage</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.699" end="00:11:41.149" style="s2">and attention-seeking that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.539" end="00:11:43.939" style="s2">accompanying the death of our previous</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.149" end="00:11:46.249" style="s2">means of communication no one no one</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.939" end="00:11:49.099" style="s2">knows how to handle that and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.249" end="00:11:50.479" style="s2">a big problem let&#39;s got me I know so</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.099" end="00:11:51.919" style="s2">many in this audience and not just here</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.479" end="00:11:53.389" style="s2">in New York but we hear from our members</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.919" end="00:11:56.359" style="s2">all over the country they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.389" end="00:11:59.299" style="s2">concerned about what their children and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.359" end="00:12:01.549" style="s2">what their grandchildren are both being</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.299" end="00:12:04.069" style="s2">taught but also what they&#39;re coming back</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.549" end="00:12:05.749" style="s2">home from college and talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.069" end="00:12:06.739" style="s2">saying where are you where are they</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.749" end="00:12:08.209" style="s2">learning them and I know where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.739" end="00:12:10.819" style="s2">learning it but how does this get</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.209" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">seeping into them you obviously have</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.819" end="00:12:14.109" style="s2">spoken out not just 15 or so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:17.659" style="s2">Toronto but colleges all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.109" end="00:12:19.549" style="s2">what is it you see today on the campus</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.659" end="00:12:22.159" style="s2">or among young people today that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.549" end="00:12:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s new or may or is it new I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.159" end="00:12:25.399" style="s2">heard you say that we&#39;re no more</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.599" end="00:12:27.139" style="s2">polarized today than we were maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.399" end="00:12:28.969" style="s2">under Richard Nixon and the campuses</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.139" end="00:12:30.649" style="s2">were more on fire than that even they</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.969" end="00:12:32.929" style="s2">are today so what are the similarities</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.649" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">and differences that you&#39;re saying well</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.929" end="00:12:39.259" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see any real evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:41.449" style="s2">that your society is more polarized</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.259" end="00:12:43.219" style="s2">generally speaking than it has been at</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.449" end="00:12:45.499" style="s2">many times in the past and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.219" end="00:12:47.749" style="s2">Nixon era is a good example I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.499" end="00:12:50.089" style="s2">you if you think about it merely</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.749" end="00:12:53.599" style="s2">statistically I mean you&#39;ve been split</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.089" end="00:12:55.429" style="s2">50/50 Republican Democrat for what five</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.429" end="00:13:01.099" style="s2">50/50 split that really hasn&#39;t changed</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.689" end="00:13:03.709" style="s2">Trump of course is somewhat of a wild</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.099" end="00:13:05.209" style="s2">card and so that complicates things but</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.709" end="00:13:11.149" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it changes the underlying</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.369" end="00:21:23.559" style="s2">well we had audiences for fifty five</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.559" end="00:21:28.179" style="s2">quite remarkable you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.389" end="00:21:30.789" style="s2">fifty five hundred people would come to</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.399" end="00:22:31.519" style="s2">is going to be difficult and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.100" end="00:22:35.820" style="s2">difficult beyond both imagining and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.519" end="00:22:38.100" style="s2">tolerance and that that is definitely in</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.100" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">and for many people it&#39;s in their</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:48.870" style="s2">that can be unbearable that enough to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.350" end="00:22:51.149" style="s2">turn you against life itself to corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.870" end="00:22:53.130" style="s2">to corrupt you to to drive you to</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.130" end="00:23:01.620" style="s2">worse to drive you to thoughts of</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:16.769" style="s2">nature and and then it&#39;s worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.549" end="00:23:18.750" style="s2">actually because it&#39;s not only that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.769" end="00:23:22.049" style="s2">suffer and and that that will</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.750" end="00:23:23.880" style="s2">necessarily occur but that we all make</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.880" end="00:23:30.779" style="s2">ignorance and our malevolence and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.909" end="00:23:36.419" style="s2">everyone knows that to be true and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.779" end="00:23:41.159" style="s2">the discussions start let&#39;s say on a on</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.419" end="00:23:43.340" style="s2">our on an unshakable foundation but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.159" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">I can tell people look despite that</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.510" end="00:24:00.750" style="s2">reality of that malevolence voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.370" end="00:24:02.909" style="s2">we can actually do that and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.750" end="00:24:04.529" style="s2">psychological evidence suggests and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.909" end="00:24:06.740" style="s2">is independent of your school of</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.649" end="00:24:29.700" style="s2">meaningful to do that psychologically</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.140" end="00:25:04.410" style="s2">to undergraduates I asked them you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.720" end="00:25:08.100" style="s2">how much time do you waste every day by</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.100" end="00:25:13.620" style="s2">between five and eight hours it&#39;s a lot</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.480" end="00:25:33.270" style="s2">through in any case people do waste a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.170" end="00:25:35.690" style="s2">lot of time and there they also act</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.270" end="00:25:38.580" style="s2">counter productively a lot of the time</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.150" end="00:25:51.030" style="s2">lives and we can resist the malevolence</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.920" end="00:26:46.920" style="s2">is there and it&#39;s not difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.100" end="00:26:50.350" style="s2">communicate to people about this like</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.920" end="00:26:52.300" style="s2">everyone knows that you wake up at 3:00</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.350" end="00:26:55.300" style="s2">in the morning when you&#39;ve left let your</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.020" end="00:27:04.750" style="s2">your cruelty and your failure to take</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:06.910" style="s2">off to take the opportunities that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:09.610" style="s2">in front of you and if you were the</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.610" end="00:27:14.890" style="s2">the captain of your own destiny if there</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.670" end="00:27:17.140" style="s2">was no intrinsic nature well that would</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.890" end="00:27:17.860" style="s2">never happen you&#39;d just let yourself off</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.140" end="00:27:19.660" style="s2">the hook</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.860" end="00:27:23.080" style="s2">there&#39;d be no voice of conscience</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.080" end="00:27:28.900" style="s2">that and what that indicates is to me is</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.630" end="00:27:30.940" style="s2">that at least psychologically we live in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.900" end="00:27:32.890" style="s2">a universe that&#39;s characterized by a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.940" end="00:27:35.380" style="s2">moral dimension and we understand that</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.380" end="00:27:40.870" style="s2">consequences and then and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">not trivial they destroy you they</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.870" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">destroy your family they destroy your</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:49.840" style="s2">community and and you can tell people</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:52.780" style="s2">that and they listen because they know</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:54.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t know they know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.780" end="00:27:56.650" style="s2">thing and maybe that&#39;s the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.040" end="00:28:01.060" style="s2">being an intellectual you do you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.650" end="00:28:04.360" style="s2">the opportunity to articulate ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.060" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">other people know they embody but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.360" end="00:28:09.640" style="s2">can&#39;t articulate and that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">tell me you know they say well you help</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.640" end="00:28:16.630" style="s2">me give words to things that I always</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">knew to be true but couldn&#39;t say or or</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.630" end="00:28:21.450" style="s2">they say I&#39;ve been trying to put some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:24.250" style="s2">your precepts into practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.450" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">responsibility being a main one vision</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.250" end="00:28:28.760" style="s2">another honesty I</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:31.429" style="s2">was bringing up the pack and saying this</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.760" end="00:28:33.890" style="s2">is the fun part of doing all of this fun</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.429" end="00:28:36.020" style="s2">is a weak word that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.890" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">it&#39;s the remarkable part of doing all</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.020" end="00:28:41.059" style="s2">this I mean I have people tell me</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:43.370" style="s2">constantly wherever I go it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.059" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">delightful that you know they were in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.370" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">pretty dark place and they tell me why</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s plenty of dark places in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:52.010" style="s2">world and they decided well maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:55.070" style="s2">were gonna develop a bit of a vision and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:56.990" style="s2">take a bit more responsibility and start</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.070" end="00:28:58.580" style="s2">telling the truth and putting some</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.990" end="00:29:00.860" style="s2">effort into something and they come up</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.580" end="00:29:03.049" style="s2">and they say well you can&#39;t believe how</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.860" end="00:29:06.200" style="s2">much better things are hearts like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.049" end="00:29:08.350" style="s2">got I got three promotions I had one guy</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.200" end="00:29:12.230" style="s2">tell me this was a lovely story you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.350" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">15 seconds he came up after a talk he</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.230" end="00:29:16.549" style="s2">said two years ago I got out of jail it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:20.690" style="s2">was homeless he said I own my own house</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.549" end="00:29:23.000" style="s2">I have a six-figure income I got married</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.690" end="00:29:25.429" style="s2">and I have a daughter thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.000" end="00:29:28.910" style="s2">that was the whole conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.429" end="00:29:30.620" style="s2">like he decided he decided he was going</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.910" end="00:29:33.110" style="s2">to put his life together and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.620" end="00:29:36.230" style="s2">and so you can look at that pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.110" end="00:29:38.419" style="s2">that constitutes let&#39;s say the core of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.230" end="00:29:40.820" style="s2">what well I think it&#39;s the core</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.419" end="00:29:43.190" style="s2">religious message really is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.820" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">tragic nature of the world the reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.190" end="00:29:48.290" style="s2">of suffering it&#39;s it&#39;s part of the core</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:51.490" style="s2">religious message but what emerges out</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.290" end="00:29:54.440" style="s2">of that properly conceptualized is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.490" end="00:29:56.380" style="s2">remarkable appreciation for what human</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.440" end="00:30:03.110" style="s2">beings are capable of like we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.380" end="00:30:06.410" style="s2">unbelievably resilient and and able</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.110" end="00:30:09.110" style="s2">creatures and we do not have any</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.410" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">conception of our upper limits dr.</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.110" end="00:30:12.500" style="s2">priewe so let me ask you I mean we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:13.700" style="s2">about 10 minutes and I&#39;m gonna get a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:15.860" style="s2">couple questions in here from our</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.700" end="00:30:17.510" style="s2">audience on this to but is that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.860" end="00:30:19.490" style="s2">hope that you&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.510" end="00:30:21.950" style="s2">you&#39;re giving people hope young people</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.490" end="00:30:26.059" style="s2">hope is that one of the secrets to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.950" end="00:30:27.799" style="s2">reaching them you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.059" end="00:30:30.650" style="s2">it&#39;s such a perverse sort of hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.799" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">because I would say for the last 45</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.650" end="00:30:36.530" style="s2">years we&#39;ve told psychologists have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:39.290" style="s2">have been certainly to blame for this at</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.530" end="00:30:39.960" style="s2">least in part you&#39;re ok the way you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.290" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.960" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">tell young people oh you&#39;re okay the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:47.040" style="s2">you are it&#39;s like and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:49.010" style="s2">worse than you can tell that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.040" end="00:30:51.750" style="s2">tell someone who&#39;s young than that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.010" end="00:30:53.190" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re miserable you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.750" end="00:30:55.470" style="s2">and lots of them why if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.190" end="00:30:57.150" style="s2">miserable and aimless it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.470" end="00:30:58.920" style="s2">miserable and aimless and sometimes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.150" end="00:31:00.840" style="s2">suicidal and I&#39;m nya list ik and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.920" end="00:31:02.550" style="s2">have any direction in your life it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.840" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">my life it&#39;s like well you&#39;re okay the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.550" end="00:31:06.600" style="s2">way you are here and it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">don&#39;t want to hear that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.600" end="00:31:14.580" style="s2">hear look you know you&#39;re and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">this you&#39;re useless you know nothing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.580" end="00:31:18.660" style="s2">haven&#39;t got started</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:21.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got 60 years to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.660" end="00:31:25.620" style="s2">together and god only knows what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.630" end="00:31:28.290" style="s2">could become and that&#39;s so that message</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.620" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">is so much more it&#39;s so funny because</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.290" end="00:31:35.910" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s such an attack but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.890" style="s2">positive because there&#39;s faith there in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.910" end="00:31:39.350" style="s2">the in the potential that makes up the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.890" end="00:31:41.850" style="s2">person rather than the miserable</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.350" end="00:31:44.160" style="s2">actuality that happens to be manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.850" end="00:31:46.170" style="s2">itself at the moment and young people</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.160" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">respond extraordinarily well to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.170" end="00:31:51.630" style="s2">because when you know that if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:54.390" style="s2">parent and you love your your child your</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.630" end="00:31:58.890" style="s2">son your daughter what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:32:01.560" style="s2">foster is the best in them you want that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.890" end="00:32:03.030" style="s2">to manifest itself across the course of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.560" end="00:32:06.390" style="s2">their life you want them to become</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.030" end="00:32:10.770" style="s2">continually more than they are to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.390" end="00:32:12.390" style="s2">what they could be and well and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.770" end="00:32:14.490" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the great message of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.390" end="00:32:17.220" style="s2">West is that that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.490" end="00:32:20.930" style="s2">the ethical requirement of individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.220" end="00:32:24.900" style="s2">being in the proper sense is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.930" end="00:32:27.810" style="s2">constantly note that you&#39;re not what you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.900" end="00:32:32.100" style="s2">could be to take responsibility for that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.810" end="00:32:35.930" style="s2">and to and to commit yourself like body</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.100" end="00:32:38.040" style="s2">and soul to the attainment of that ideal</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.930" end="00:32:39.300" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get a question here from our</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.040" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">members about right here on the front</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.300" end="00:32:43.740" style="s2">row Bob Grantham had a couple good</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.980" end="00:32:45.480" style="s2">questions right here uh he asked much of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.740" end="00:32:47.070" style="s2">your effort today is trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.480" end="00:32:49.470" style="s2">people improve their lives we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.070" end="00:32:52.710" style="s2">been talking about that why does the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.470" end="00:32:53.750" style="s2">establishment attack you rather than try</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.710" end="00:32:57.680" style="s2">to support you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.750" end="00:33:01.730" style="s2">efforts well you know we should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.680" end="00:33:04.000" style="s2">nuanced about that I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.730" end="00:33:07.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of newspapers in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.000" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">called post media that&#39;s 200 newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.250" end="00:33:13.310" style="s2">strong and they supported me you know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:16.460" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve had a lot of support from</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.310" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">journalists and I would say I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.460" end="00:33:20.360" style="s2">more support from the higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:23.810" style="s2">journalists which I&#39;m quite happy about</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.360" end="00:33:27.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s polarized you know there isn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.810" end="00:33:29.330" style="s2">have a dedicated coterie of people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.890" end="00:33:31.520" style="s2">regard me as an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.330" end="00:33:35.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.520" end="00:33:37.250" style="s2">it&#39;s because I am I am absolutely no fan</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.030" end="00:33:41.690" style="s2">whatsoever of the radical left I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.250" end="00:33:44.720" style="s2">the the fact that you can actively</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.720" end="00:33:53.330" style="s2">as a communist is as the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.450" end="00:34:10.140" style="s2">and I think I understand the motivations</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.750" end="00:34:22.530" style="s2">a relatively effective critic and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.929" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">makes me very unpopular so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.530" end="00:34:33.330" style="s2">fine because I&#39;m not because what people</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.810" end="00:37:10.190" style="s2">and and and that should be celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.630" end="00:37:12.410" style="s2">but it so today it should also be</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.410" end="00:37:49.369" style="s2">things I learned I did a series of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.730" end="00:37:52.099" style="s2">biblical lectures in 2017 which have</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.369" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">turned out to be crazily popular of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.099" end="00:37:56.060" style="s2">the insane things to be and I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.270" style="s2">supposed to ask you why do you yes that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.060" end="00:38:01.220" style="s2">is yes yes well I learned one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.270" end="00:38:02.510" style="s2">things I learned in in in in those</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.220" end="00:38:05.270" style="s2">lectures and should have known before</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.510" end="00:38:08.900" style="s2">was that the word Israel so they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.270" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">chosen people of God the people of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:14.810" style="s2">Israel are those who wrestle with God</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:16.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s such an interesting idea you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.810" end="00:38:18.740" style="s2">know it&#39;s a fascinating idea because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.760" end="00:38:20.420" style="s2">indicates at least even even in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.740" end="00:38:22.609" style="s2">deepest religious texts that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.420" end="00:38:25.010" style="s2">some there&#39;s something about existential</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.609" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">conflict and engaging in that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.010" end="00:38:30.109" style="s2">actually part of the moral substructure</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:32.599" style="s2">of life that that that that simple</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.599" end="00:38:38.510" style="s2">mean in a deity isn&#39;t sufficient is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">there&#39;s an active engagement with with</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.510" end="00:38:43.550" style="s2">with the infinite and then and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.910" end="00:38:45.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a battle in some sense and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.550" end="00:38:46.970" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the proper way to</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.030" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">than you could have otherwise been so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.800" end="00:39:02.300" style="s2">you need that and you need your friends</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:04.369" style="s2">and you need to develop a network of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.300" end="00:39:06.080" style="s2">friendship and you need to put your</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.369" end="00:39:08.119" style="s2">family together and to act responsibly</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.080" end="00:39:10.190" style="s2">towards them and then you need to move</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.119" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">out from that into the broader community</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.190" end="00:39:13.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s on you and that&#39;s how you</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.370" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">you you you you make it a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.450" end="00:39:24.200" style="s2">ideal that you&#39;re pursuing and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:27.080" style="s2">you realize that that&#39;s that&#39;s up to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.200" end="00:39:30.080" style="s2">to do and maybe then you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.080" end="00:39:32.270" style="s2">you can do it as well if you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.080" end="00:39:34.310" style="s2">to make the right sacrifices which</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.270" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">really usually means burning off a fair</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.310" end="00:39:38.500" style="s2">bit of of Deadwood and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:43.010" style="s2">something that people are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.500" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">excited about doing and no wonder our</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.010" end="00:39:47.150" style="s2">time has been too short we have time for</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:49.730" style="s2">just one more final question I&#39;m told</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.150" end="00:39:52.280" style="s2">what have I not asked you about I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.730" end="00:39:53.900" style="s2">been thinking of our theme of standing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.280" end="00:39:55.220" style="s2">up against socialism what have I not</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.900" end="00:39:56.540" style="s2">asked you about what have other</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.220" end="00:39:58.520" style="s2">interviewers not ask you about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.540" end="00:40:00.380" style="s2">would be beneficial for us all to know</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.520" end="00:40:01.910" style="s2">as we want to take well you you you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.380" end="00:40:03.770" style="s2">asked a little bit about these biblical</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.910" end="00:40:06.500" style="s2">lectures you know one what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.770" end="00:40:10.460" style="s2">interesting was I rented a theater in</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.500" end="00:40:12.920" style="s2">Toronto I rented it 15 times and and was</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.460" end="00:40:16.100" style="s2">a theater for about 500 and it sold out</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.920" end="00:40:18.080" style="s2">every time and I lectured about Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.100" end="00:40:20.030" style="s2">which and it was mostly young men who</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.080" end="00:40:21.620" style="s2">came they weren&#39;t all young but they</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.030" end="00:40:23.960" style="s2">were mostly men which was very</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.620" end="00:40:28.520" style="s2">surprising because like that&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.960" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">what happens and what the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.520" end="00:40:37.610" style="s2">the the the lectures worked and and was</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:39.470" style="s2">because I put together something that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.610" end="00:40:41.600" style="s2">don&#39;t think liberals or conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.470" end="00:40:43.850" style="s2">have done a good job of putting together</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.600" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">the Liberals are more on the happiness</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.850" end="00:40:47.120" style="s2">and freedom end of things and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:49.850" style="s2">conservatives are more on the duty end</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.850" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">have their place but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.310" end="00:40:58.220" style="s2">attempting to develop an argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:41:00.740" style="s2">centered on meaning and I do believe and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.220" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">I believe that our our most central</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.740" end="00:41:05.180" style="s2">religious symbols like the symbol of the</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.839" end="00:41:32.689" style="s2">it&#39;s dreadful in some sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.439" end="00:41:35.299" style="s2">classic sense and you need a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.689" end="00:41:37.369" style="s2">that can sustain you through that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.299" end="00:41:39.109" style="s2">that&#39;s to be found in responsibility and</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.049" style="s2">ourselves but we certainly haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.459" end="00:41:49.249" style="s2">communicated it to young people it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.380" end="00:42:01.969" style="s2">well not by pursuing impulsive happiness</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.989" end="00:42:03.949" style="s2">that is not going to work not by</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.969" end="00:42:05.779" style="s2">thinking in the short term not by</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.949" end="00:42:09.109" style="s2">thinking in a narrowly selfish manner</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.779" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">either but by taking on the heaviest</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.109" end="00:42:14.719" style="s2">load of responsibility that you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:16.609" style="s2">conceptualize and bear that will do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.719" end="00:42:18.829" style="s2">it&#39;ll do it for you it&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.609" end="00:42:22.219" style="s2">reason to wake up in the morning it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.829" end="00:42:24.199" style="s2">give you a balm for your conscience when</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.219" end="00:42:26.479" style="s2">you wake up at night and ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.199" end="00:42:29.209" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing with your life it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.479" end="00:42:31.789" style="s2">make you a credit to yourself and to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.209" end="00:42:34.909" style="s2">your family and it&#39;ll make you a boon to</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.789" end="00:42:37.459" style="s2">your community and more than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.909" end="00:42:41.689" style="s2">there&#39;s more than that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.459" end="00:42:43.880" style="s2">said in the Genesis that every person is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.689" end="00:42:47.029" style="s2">made in the image of God and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.880" end="00:42:49.969" style="s2">idea in Genesis that God is that which</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.029" end="00:42:51.049" style="s2">confronts the chaos of potential with</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.969" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">truth and courage</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.049" end="00:42:57.349" style="s2">that&#39;s the logos and if we&#39;re made in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:42:59.719" style="s2">the image of God that&#39;s us that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.349" end="00:43:02.779" style="s2">we do is we confront the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.719" end="00:43:05.959" style="s2">chaos the future the unformed future we</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.779" end="00:43:09.049" style="s2">confront that consciously and we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.959" end="00:43:11.869" style="s2">decide with every ethical choice we make</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.049" end="00:43:14.809" style="s2">what kind of world we&#39;re going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.869" end="00:43:16.789" style="s2">into being we transform that potential</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.809" end="00:43:18.709" style="s2">into actuality and we do that as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.789" end="00:43:20.299" style="s2">consequence of our ethical decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.709" end="00:43:21.739" style="s2">so it&#39;s not only a matter of putting</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.299" end="00:43:23.749" style="s2">yourself together and putting your</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.739" end="00:43:25.819" style="s2">family together putting your community</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.749" end="00:43:29.949" style="s2">together it&#39;s a matter of bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.819" end="00:43:33.079" style="s2">world in its proper shape into being and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.949" end="00:43:35.089" style="s2">I truly believe that that&#39;s the case and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.079" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">I believe that we all believe that but</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.089" end="00:43:39.469" style="s2">we hold ourselves responsible you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:40.250" style="s2">that if you&#39;ve made a mistake with your</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.469" end="00:43:41.510" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.250" end="00:43:43.730" style="s2">because you were selfish or</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.510" end="00:43:47.510" style="s2">narrow-minded or blind in some manner</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.730" end="00:43:49.940" style="s2">that you regard yourself as culpable you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.510" end="00:43:51.320" style="s2">could have done otherwise and now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.940" end="00:43:54.440" style="s2">brought something into the world that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.320" end="00:43:56.869" style="s2">should not be there and it&#39;s on you we</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.440" end="00:43:58.609" style="s2">we hold ourselves responsible in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.869" end="00:44:00.650" style="s2">matter and so what that indicates to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.609" end="00:44:04.570" style="s2">is that in a deep sense we believe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.650" end="00:44:07.849" style="s2">we are the agents that transform the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.570" end="00:44:12.890" style="s2">potential of being into reality and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.849" end="00:44:13.820" style="s2">is a divine if anything is links us with</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.890" end="00:44:17.090" style="s2">divinity</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.820" end="00:44:20.840" style="s2">it&#39;s our capability to transform what is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:22.430" style="s2">not yet into what is and and the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.840" end="00:44:23.780" style="s2">thing that happens and I&#39;ll stop with</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.430" end="00:44:25.970" style="s2">this in Genesis and this is so</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.780" end="00:44:28.940" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s so fascinating is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.970" end="00:44:31.220" style="s2">as god conducts himself through this</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.940" end="00:44:34.780" style="s2">enterprise of the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.220" end="00:44:38.200" style="s2">potential into actuality he stops</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.780" end="00:44:41.390" style="s2">repeatedly and says and it was good and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.200" end="00:44:45.050" style="s2">and then that did and that&#39;s a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.390" end="00:44:49.700" style="s2">is why is it good and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.050" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">something like well if what if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.700" end="00:44:56.210" style="s2">conduct yourself with the courage that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:44:59.630" style="s2">enables you to accept your vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.210" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">which is no trivial matter and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.630" end="00:45:06.440" style="s2">truthful then what you bring out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:09.859" style="s2">potential is what&#39;s good and that sets</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.440" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">the world right and that&#39;s up to us and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.859" end="00:45:18.170" style="s2">to me that&#39;s the great that&#39;s the great</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:20.210" style="s2">story of the West that&#39;s why we regard</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.170" end="00:45:24.230" style="s2">ourselves as sovereign individuals of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.210" end="00:45:26.119" style="s2">value is that&#39;s what we are and we need</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.230" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">to know that to take ourselves seriously</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.119" end="00:45:33.740" style="s2">and to act properly in the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:37.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I said in the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.740" end="00:45:41.510" style="s2">lectures in many hours and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
