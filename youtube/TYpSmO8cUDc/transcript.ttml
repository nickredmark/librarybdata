<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">yes we in fact did do a prior</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">conversation which i regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:34.910" style="s2">absolutely excellent but it was our</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">first conversation in the studio and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.910" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">studio did not function up to par so I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">but but I&#39;m hoping we can get there I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.149" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">feel like this was that was probably my</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:55.500" style="s2">fault somehow in a grand karmic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">sense I have a reputation which my wife</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.500" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">will happily corroborate for you of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:01.890" style="s2">being the person around which technology</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">tends to malfunction for no particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.890" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">reason at all and so you know I put on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">watch it tends to break for no</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">discernible reason within two or three</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">months hence I do not wear one internet</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:15.030" style="s2">connections seem to slow when I&#39;m around</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">interesting times yeah I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.030" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">this this is this may be some strange</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">kind of you know static electrical</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">signal I&#39;m giving off or it might just</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:30.180" style="s2">be a function of the fact that for</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">whatever reason Murphy&#39;s Law suggests</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.180" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">that because I need to use technology so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">consistent meaning in my life I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">ever get it to actually work well</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">because I&#39;m destined to be frustrated in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">that relationship you know in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">everlasting way and to frustrate other</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">people around me in the process</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">so no particular reason for it I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">come up with but feel free to blame me</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:54.930" style="s2">their interests for explanation Murphy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">Law has never worked for me which I find</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">interesting technology isn&#39;t pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">I&#39;m fine around tech so probably that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">was you and not me I find mirrors don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">work they break upon you so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">what that&#39;s about exactly but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">either an aesthetic issue or an honesty</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:14.340" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s one of the two are both</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:16.850" style="s2">actually possibly could be yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.340" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">right well let&#39;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.850" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">we could talk about better angels or we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">could start with some of the larger</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">larger issues maybe tell us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">about better angels right yeah so better</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:32.190" style="s2">angels is the nation&#39;s largest</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:34.880" style="s2">bipartisan grassroots organization</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.190" end="00:02:38.060" style="s2">dedicated to the work of political</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.880" end="00:02:41.030" style="s2">depolarization in the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.060" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">we&#39;re a volunteer group we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.030" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">thousands of members dues-paying members</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">across the country now have about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">thousand volunteers scattered across all</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">50 states and better angels is a group</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">that is best known or at least best</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">covered in the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">for a program that we have called a red</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:03.660" style="s2">blue workshop where we take small groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:05.850" style="s2">of folks from the right and from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.660" end="00:03:09.270" style="s2">left or Reds and blues as we say in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.850" end="00:03:11.490" style="s2">house bring them together for a session</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.270" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">in which they don&#39;t argue and debate</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.490" end="00:03:16.160" style="s2">about politics per se but rather we give</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:18.840" style="s2">each side the opportunity through</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.160" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">moderated exercises to speak from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.840" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">vantage point of their own of their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:25.290" style="s2">personal or lived experience so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">in terms of why they see politics the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.290" end="00:03:30.330" style="s2">way they do so folks we literally apply</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">marriage counseling techniques to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.330" end="00:03:34.680" style="s2">political conversations which you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:36.300" style="s2">seems probably like an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.680" end="00:03:39.590" style="s2">metaphor for what&#39;s needed in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.300" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">context of our political dialogue today</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.590" end="00:03:47.450" style="s2">but what folks are what but what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">vision of better angels increasingly has</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.450" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">become is one in which we seek to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">the values and the culture of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">interaction that is established in these</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">sorts of gatherings and to use that as</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:03.209" style="s2">sort of an initial peak experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">whereby we are able to route people into</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.209" end="00:04:09.630" style="s2">participating in bipartisan structures</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:12.470" style="s2">in their own communities excuse me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.630" end="00:04:15.600" style="s2">allow them to pursue advocacy over</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.470" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">issues and and policies and community</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.600" end="00:04:19.140" style="s2">projects that reach a certain consensus</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">within a local better angels alliance</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.140" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">what we call basically local better</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:25.409" style="s2">angels chapter to empower them</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:29.219" style="s2">work collaboratively in local</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.409" end="00:04:32.969" style="s2">communities and in building off of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.219" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">to highlight this work through a digital</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.969" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">media presence that&#39;s meant to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">take the norms established in these</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">local relationships and scale that up</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:45.930" style="s2">into a national narrative and so our</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:48.749" style="s2">larger effort is to is to essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.930" end="00:04:52.199" style="s2">spearhead a heterodox movement in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.749" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">country that is able to sort of turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.199" end="00:04:57.659" style="s2">back the turn back the tide in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">our increasingly fractured narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.659" end="00:05:01.229" style="s2">understanding of America&#39;s being split</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:04.229" style="s2">between two tribes we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.229" end="00:05:07.169" style="s2">consolidate the notion that there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.229" end="00:05:08.939" style="s2">sort of a unifying bedrock of values and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.169" end="00:05:11.250" style="s2">and spirit that exists within the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.939" end="00:05:13.080" style="s2">American people to stabilize what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.250" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">currently a very unstable social and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.080" end="00:05:17.939" style="s2">political climate in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:19.529" style="s2">so I do think that there is a heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.939" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">movement I haven&#39;t heard anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.529" end="00:05:23.479" style="s2">point to it that way obviously heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">Academy is mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.479" end="00:05:27.419" style="s2">spearheading the sort of effort and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:28.979" style="s2">Jonathan Hyde is on our board of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.419" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">directors it&#39;s better angels but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.979" end="00:05:33.089" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that it doesn&#39;t surprise me</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.969" end="00:05:52.379" style="s2">or the hopefulness that they see and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.279" end="00:05:54.509" style="s2">fact that some of us are managing to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.379" end="00:05:57.300" style="s2">it so yes it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moment when this</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.509" end="00:05:58.939" style="s2">idea is ripe and and the place that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.300" end="00:06:01.379" style="s2">and I first encountered each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.939" end="00:06:03.930" style="s2">better angels which frankly I had never</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.379" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">heard of before you guys contacted us</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.930" end="00:06:11.789" style="s2">had Heather and me in a was it a debate</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">is that what we called it or was well</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.789" end="00:06:17.189" style="s2">okay so going back in time a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:21.779" style="s2">actually that was not a better angels of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.189" end="00:06:23.969" style="s2">it that was a bridging our divide says</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.779" end="00:06:26.189" style="s2">so I became a better angels because you</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.189" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">what better right and so Shiloh reached</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.169" end="00:06:32.519" style="s2">out to me for that to moderate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:35.669" style="s2">conversation with you Heather and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.519" end="00:06:37.480" style="s2">couple of other individuals representing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.669" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">a sort of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.480" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">perspective I think he&#39;s saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:43.420" style="s2">was on the social injustice side if</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">there are the social injustice</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.420" end="00:06:50.490" style="s2">interesting you&#39;re not the first person</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:52.600" style="s2">to throw that allegation yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.490" end="00:06:54.010" style="s2">Shiloh reached out to me because of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.600" end="00:06:55.720" style="s2">position better angels to moderate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.010" end="00:06:57.580" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s what brought us into</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.720" end="00:06:59.650" style="s2">the same sort of orbit but of course I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.580" end="00:07:01.600" style="s2">was very familiar with you and Heather</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.650" end="00:07:03.940" style="s2">because I had been tracking the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.600" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">intellectual dark web space as its and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.940" end="00:07:08.980" style="s2">actually at that time I&#39;m not even sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">that phrase was even in vogue but it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.980" end="00:07:14.710" style="s2">evident that there was a space forming</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">that that at that point I think and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.710" end="00:07:18.100" style="s2">in any event that&#39;s how we wound up</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">finding our way into the same universe</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.100" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">all right well my apologies to Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:27.160" style="s2">and his organization for conflating you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.780" style="s2">all with them but in any case working in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.160" end="00:07:30.130" style="s2">a saint working in the same spirit stay</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.780" end="00:07:32.890" style="s2">in the same spirit and I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.130" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">a lot of us fellow travelers looking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.890" end="00:07:38.590" style="s2">bridge divides yeah various kinds so in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:41.170" style="s2">any case I&#39;m glad that it did bring us</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.590" end="00:07:43.570" style="s2">into contact yeah but when you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.170" end="00:07:46.300" style="s2">moderated that debate I was simply very</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.570" end="00:07:48.820" style="s2">impressed by not only how deeply you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.300" end="00:07:51.430" style="s2">understood the issues but how deeply you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:55.170" style="s2">seemed to understand people and that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.430" end="00:07:57.940" style="s2">know that I can&#39;t recall if it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.170" end="00:08:01.150" style="s2">portrayed as a debate but the fact is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.940" end="00:08:03.250" style="s2">was the sort of pairing that might have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.150" end="00:08:05.830" style="s2">result in a contentious discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.250" end="00:08:08.980" style="s2">the way you managed it I think we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.830" end="00:08:10.570" style="s2">productive but there was no rancor of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.980" end="00:08:12.820" style="s2">any kind and that&#39;s you know the way I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.570" end="00:08:15.220" style="s2">think those of us who understand what</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.820" end="00:08:19.570" style="s2">this heterodox movement is about prefer</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.220" end="00:08:24.630" style="s2">it right yeah yeah I mean there&#39;s um I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.570" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.630" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">starting point assumption that I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:33.630" style="s2">we want to bring to communication with</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:36.580" style="s2">people on a on the other side of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.630" end="00:08:40.390" style="s2">particular issue or a broader worldview</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.580" end="00:08:42.610" style="s2">that has the potential to sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.390" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">only allow for civil discourse to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.610" end="00:08:49.150" style="s2">place but to allow for an actual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:50.440" style="s2">felt bond of connection to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.150" end="00:08:52.420" style="s2">established</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:08:54.070" style="s2">at least with respect to a common</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.420" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">recognition of the human dignity that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.070" end="00:08:58.900" style="s2">exists on either side of a divide and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:09:00.970" style="s2">that&#39;s just the Assumption going into an</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.900" end="00:09:02.980" style="s2">exchange like that that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">humanity and that other individual to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.980" end="00:09:07.870" style="s2">found and so this actually it brings me</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:10.870" style="s2">to something I&#39;m interested in exploring</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.870" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">with you a little bit because I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.870" end="00:09:15.190" style="s2">perceived there as being kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:17.080" style="s2">broader sort of heterodox culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.190" end="00:09:20.340" style="s2">percolating you know in the United</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.080" end="00:09:23.860" style="s2">States and certainly beyond that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.340" end="00:09:25.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very interested in the sorts</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.860" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">of very empirically grounded</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.710" end="00:09:30.010" style="s2">conversations that have taken place</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:32.500" style="s2">you know centering around yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.010" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">sam harris and other folks in the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.500" end="00:09:39.150" style="s2">space and so forth it seems like in one</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:43.930" style="s2">area there&#39;s this focus on the power of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.150" end="00:09:45.580" style="s2">reason to sort of transcend our tribal</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.930" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">divides which i think is which i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.580" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">is real in the space in which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">working better angels and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.860" end="00:09:54.700" style="s2">you know small constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:09:57.660" style="s2">organizations like living room</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.700" end="00:10:01.060" style="s2">conversations and bridge Alliance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.660" end="00:10:04.390" style="s2">media sites like all sides and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.060" end="00:10:07.030" style="s2">there&#39;s been this emphasis on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.390" end="00:10:09.910" style="s2">empathy as the starting point for</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.030" end="00:10:11.770" style="s2">constructive dialog and this also</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.910" end="00:10:13.450" style="s2">therefore unfolds in a very heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.770" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">sort of sort of place because in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.450" end="00:10:18.670" style="s2">programs better angels were focused on</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:21.400" style="s2">bringing people into relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.670" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">each other and so it seems to me that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.400" end="00:10:27.460" style="s2">in these two sorts of somewhat parallel</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:28.780" style="s2">kinds of spaces there&#39;s a common concern</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.460" end="00:10:32.260" style="s2">with wanting to bring people together</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.780" end="00:10:33.490" style="s2">across these divides but sometimes I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.260" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">listen to folks having these</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.490" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">conversations in the digital dome and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:42.340" style="s2">seems to there seems to be a recognition</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">of the fact that you have to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.340" end="00:10:47.020" style="s2">the emotional center of another person</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">to be able to to move them and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.020" end="00:10:51.880" style="s2">focus sometimes tends to be on the rash</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">the power of the rational exchange to</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.880" end="00:10:59.790" style="s2">move people into a you know into</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.870" end="00:11:03.140" style="s2">alignment across tribal divisions and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.790" end="00:11:05.390" style="s2">wonder in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.140" end="00:11:08.290" style="s2">intellectual dark web space if there</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.390" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t a sense sometimes that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.290" end="00:11:13.490" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a limits to the efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:16.220" style="s2">of focusing on the rational component</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.490" end="00:11:18.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s succeeded in sparking a broad</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.220" end="00:11:20.060" style="s2">audience whereas in our in in in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.440" end="00:11:21.380" style="s2">space the depolarization sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.060" end="00:11:23.899" style="s2">something we focus on empathy and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.380" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">seems to be effective in establishing</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.899" end="00:11:28.850" style="s2">close close intimate bonds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:31.089" style="s2">communication but it doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.850" end="00:11:33.620" style="s2">a theme that has kind of translated</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.089" end="00:11:35.480" style="s2">towards a broad kind of popular</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.620" end="00:11:37.310" style="s2">following you know we tend to be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.480" end="00:11:39.950" style="s2">constellation of small organizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.310" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">doing deep work that isn&#39;t that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.950" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">quite scaled and so that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.930" end="00:11:46.339" style="s2">focus is on figuring out you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">we get the best of both these worlds but</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.339" end="00:11:51.620" style="s2">I want to Park that really quick just to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:53.209" style="s2">see if if one if if you see something of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.620" end="00:11:54.470" style="s2">a little bit of a divide and you decided</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.209" end="00:11:56.899" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know how much of a window</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.470" end="00:11:59.300" style="s2">you have into the space that I work in</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.899" end="00:12:01.459" style="s2">on a consistent basis but if you make</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.300" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">anything of that differentiation Oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.459" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">indeed okay so you have done what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:10.089" style="s2">typically do which is you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:12.350" style="s2">introduced what you present as a small</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.089" end="00:12:13.910" style="s2">point that will be discussed and of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.350" end="00:12:16.029" style="s2">course what you&#39;ve done is you&#39;ve opened</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.910" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">a topic that could easily occupy us for</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.029" end="00:12:22.579" style="s2">10 hours I don&#39;t know but there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.610" end="00:12:25.339" style="s2">of I beg your indulgence no no I like it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.579" end="00:12:26.930" style="s2">um I&#39;m quite pleased by this topic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.339" end="00:12:28.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot of thinking about it for</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.930" end="00:12:30.890" style="s2">various reasons yeah one thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.850" end="00:12:33.589" style="s2">say is I sometimes hear people talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.890" end="00:12:36.260" style="s2">about the humanity of the person on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.589" end="00:12:37.610" style="s2">other side and I also heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.260" end="00:12:41.240" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve never heard anybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.610" end="00:12:44.270" style="s2">talk about which is the how did you put</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.240" end="00:12:46.430" style="s2">it the sense of camaraderie that arises</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.270" end="00:12:49.339" style="s2">when you do manage to cross one of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.430" end="00:12:52.220" style="s2">gap which I feel very personal yes and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.339" end="00:12:55.880" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure everybody does I can hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.220" end="00:12:58.490" style="s2">so but I know that I feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.880" end="00:13:00.860" style="s2">challenged when somebody is out of reach</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.490" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">yeah and that if I succeed in crossing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.860" end="00:13:08.180" style="s2">the divide it feels very good and not</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">just like a victory it feels like my</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">rewarding but I do think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.779" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">caveat here and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:20.680" style="s2">via will help us get where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.180" end="00:13:21.910" style="s2">suggesting we need to go which has</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.680" end="00:13:24.879" style="s2">something to do with the admixture</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.910" end="00:13:29.740" style="s2">between the rational and the empathic</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.879" end="00:13:31.300" style="s2">and emotional so the caveat is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.740" end="00:13:34.809" style="s2">everybody on the other side is reachable</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.300" end="00:13:36.759" style="s2">and while it is sort of tempting to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.809" end="00:13:38.769" style="s2">into the realm of well you know there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.759" end="00:13:41.589" style="s2">are sociopaths out there who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.769" end="00:13:43.269" style="s2">really attempting to accomplish the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.589" end="00:13:45.009" style="s2">thing I think we can stay out of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.269" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">realm of guessing what the motivation is</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.009" end="00:13:48.610" style="s2">and we can just simply say if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">is not interacting in good faith you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.610" end="00:13:52.929" style="s2">cannot count on crossing that divide no</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:56.709" style="s2">matter what toolkit you choose right</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.929" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">they will pull a fast one in analytical</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.709" end="00:14:02.290" style="s2">space and they will abuse your trust and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">all sorts of things so what I like to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.290" end="00:14:07.170" style="s2">is figure out whether or not the person</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">on the other side strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.170" end="00:14:11.740" style="s2">interested would they be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:13.269" style="s2">discovering that they are incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.740" end="00:14:16.149" style="s2">about something for example are they</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.269" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">interested in bridging a divide if they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.149" end="00:14:20.110" style="s2">are incorrect in their assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.730" style="s2">me would they be pleased to discover</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.730" end="00:14:24.730" style="s2">imagined or would they be disturbed by</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.439" end="00:14:27.670" style="s2">that discovery because it makes what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.730" end="00:14:30.819" style="s2">they&#39;re doing harder so if we can put</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.670" end="00:14:32.319" style="s2">aside people acting in bad faith and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.819" end="00:14:33.129" style="s2">can say there are lots of reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.319" end="00:14:35.439" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.129" end="00:14:37.569" style="s2">that don&#39;t have to do with bad faith and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.439" end="00:14:41.079" style="s2">those are the divides that are a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.569" end="00:14:43.769" style="s2">bridgeable and be worth attempting to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.079" end="00:14:46.029" style="s2">it then the question is well is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.769" end="00:14:48.850" style="s2">rationality the tool and certainly for</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.029" end="00:14:51.790" style="s2">some people it&#39;s the way in is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.850" end="00:14:53.290" style="s2">emotionality and an empathy for other</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.790" end="00:14:56.009" style="s2">people that&#39;s the way and for some of us</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.290" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of each right it&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.009" end="00:14:59.829" style="s2">exploration and to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.649" style="s2">detect somebody on their side is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.829" end="00:15:05.769" style="s2">intrigued and interested in making</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.649" end="00:15:07.209" style="s2">progress then you can sort of go step by</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.769" end="00:15:08.559" style="s2">step sort of lead climb you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.209" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">going to take the lead and they take the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.559" end="00:15:16.299" style="s2">lead that sort of thing and as for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:19.389" style="s2">know somebody in your position where</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.299" end="00:15:21.189" style="s2">this is now your job where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.389" end="00:15:22.899" style="s2">attempting to lead people into these</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.189" end="00:15:24.309" style="s2">conversations where they do discover the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.899" end="00:15:26.110" style="s2">humanity on the other side and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.309" end="00:15:28.319" style="s2">discover that the other side has a piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.110" end="00:15:31.410" style="s2">of the truth that they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.319" end="00:15:34.410" style="s2">um what should that admixture be would</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.410" end="00:15:36.299" style="s2">be 60/40 rational empathy</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.410" end="00:15:39.029" style="s2">I don&#39;t know last thing I will say</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.299" end="00:15:43.229" style="s2">before I turn it back over to you is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.029" end="00:15:45.179" style="s2">have a concept in a related space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.229" end="00:15:47.879" style="s2">not exactly the question you asked but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.179" end="00:15:51.509" style="s2">have been saying that in a policy</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.879" end="00:15:54.269" style="s2">context in order to make a compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.509" end="00:15:55.410" style="s2">policy you have to have a dispassionate</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.269" end="00:15:57.479" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.410" end="00:15:59.009" style="s2">this is counterintuitive to people but</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.479" end="00:16:00.660" style="s2">I&#39;m quite convinced of it so in other</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.009" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">words if you want a policy that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.660" end="00:16:06.629" style="s2">addresses homelessness in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">compassionate way then you have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.629" end="00:16:10.499" style="s2">game theoretic analysis which is not an</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:12.509" style="s2">emotional feel-good analysis at all</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.499" end="00:16:14.579" style="s2">right you have to understand why it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.509" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">that a city for example can&#39;t solve this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.579" end="00:16:21.779" style="s2">problem right so what i am trying if</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:22.769" style="s2">there&#39;s one grain of truth at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.779" end="00:16:27.869" style="s2">that i would like people to walk away</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.769" end="00:16:30.149" style="s2">with it&#39;s do not assume that because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.869" end="00:16:34.410" style="s2">hear somebody engaged in a dispassionate</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.149" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">analysis that they are deaf to suffering</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.410" end="00:16:38.009" style="s2">for example it may be just the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:39.989" style="s2">it may be that they take suffering</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.009" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">seriously enough that they&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.989" end="00:16:43.109" style="s2">go dispassionately at the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:47.629" style="s2">see if they can address it yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.109" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">well I agree with that and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.629" end="00:16:52.739" style="s2">one of the fundamental challenges of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:54.929" style="s2">policymaking in policy conversations is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.739" end="00:16:56.730" style="s2">the fact that and actually this goes</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.929" end="00:17:00.259" style="s2">beyond policy this just goes to other</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.730" end="00:17:03.119" style="s2">parts of our lives where in order to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.259" end="00:17:04.740" style="s2">view a complex problem in all of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.119" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">dimensions you literally need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.740" end="00:17:10.409" style="s2">maintain the space of mental focus to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:13.110" style="s2">see it clearly over a sustained period</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.409" end="00:17:14.970" style="s2">of attention so as to imagine the ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.110" end="00:17:17.789" style="s2">in which a certain issue might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.970" end="00:17:19.470" style="s2">impacted and the emotional reactions</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.789" end="00:17:21.949" style="s2">that we have to particularly the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.470" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">substance of a wicked social problem is</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.949" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">such that we can feel ourselves stirred</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:31.620" style="s2">towards solutions that might be socially</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:34.649" style="s2">gratifying for whatever reason or</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.620" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">emotionally or symbolically gratifying</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.649" end="00:17:39.179" style="s2">right but that don&#39;t actually get to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:41.399" style="s2">heart of a particular problem and so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.179" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">mean I think one potential example that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.399" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:45.510" style="s2">be the the wall idea on the southern</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">border I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.510" end="00:17:50.370" style="s2">get that wall but even so and I also</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:52.770" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the proposal of it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.370" end="00:17:54.900" style="s2">really a serious policy degree in with</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">but that&#39;s just the point though that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.900" end="00:17:58.950" style="s2">our politics tends to lend itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.940" end="00:18:01.770" style="s2">towards symbolic gestures meant to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:03.450" style="s2">appeal to our need to see something done</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.770" end="00:18:05.820" style="s2">and actually on the Left I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.450" end="00:18:08.490" style="s2">you know I mean sure folks would push</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.820" end="00:18:11.250" style="s2">back a bit on this but I think that some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.490" end="00:18:13.260" style="s2">of our some gun control measures that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.250" end="00:18:15.390" style="s2">people have proposed are also similarly</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.260" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">more symbolic than they are serious</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.390" end="00:18:21.570" style="s2">efforts you know and impacting a deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:23.549" style="s2">deep problem and so it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.570" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">you have this mismatch between the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.549" end="00:18:29.040" style="s2">emotional vigor with which we express</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:30.450" style="s2">our concern for a problem but with much</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.040" end="00:18:32.370" style="s2">more subtle but potentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.450" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">corresponding lack of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.370" end="00:18:36.510" style="s2">seriousness with which we express our</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:40.620" style="s2">concern for the substance of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.510" end="00:18:42.809" style="s2">particular problem you know because just</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.620" end="00:18:44.460" style="s2">just just to your point a person who is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.809" end="00:18:46.020" style="s2">particularly concerned with actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.460" end="00:18:48.840" style="s2">impacting a problem as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.020" end="00:18:50.970" style="s2">signalling concern for a problem as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.840" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">person who&#39;s going to is a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.970" end="00:18:54.090" style="s2">going to control him or herself enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.790" style="s2">to be able to look at the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.090" end="00:18:59.070" style="s2">it&#39;s nuanced dimensions and communicate</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.790" end="00:19:01.799" style="s2">effectively in terms of you know what a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.070" end="00:19:04.620" style="s2">serious resolution to an issue might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.799" end="00:19:06.169" style="s2">but this draws us right back to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.620" end="00:19:09.990" style="s2">starting point here which is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.169" end="00:19:13.320" style="s2">how do we create the conditions in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.990" end="00:19:15.720" style="s2">we are able to govern effectively and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.320" end="00:19:19.020" style="s2">a way to where we&#39;re able to impact</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.720" end="00:19:20.910" style="s2">problems that are significant and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.020" end="00:19:23.460" style="s2">answer to that has to be I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.910" end="00:19:26.220" style="s2">predicated upon a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.460" end="00:19:27.780" style="s2">social solidarity which brings us to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.220" end="00:19:30.299" style="s2">this question of oh how do we accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.780" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">that if we&#39;re fractured into our tribes</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.299" end="00:19:34.830" style="s2">and so forth one thing is stacked upon</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">the other right we cannot govern in a</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.710" end="00:22:40.290" style="s2">point you and I are able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">productive discussion in part because</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.250" end="00:22:48.390" style="s2">something really important people do</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.020" end="00:22:51.990" style="s2">make this assumption that either it&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.990" end="00:22:56.100" style="s2">or it isn&#39;t right right and that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s just not it&#39;s not the case</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.390" end="00:23:00.030" style="s2">but there&#39;s something and but but I</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.030" end="00:23:05.610" style="s2">that because there is something that is</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.650" end="00:23:14.760" style="s2">can demonstrate to you in practical</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.910" end="00:23:18.090" style="s2">terms why it is efficacious to love your</p>

<p begin="00:23:20.970" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">the bat it&#39;s just borrow from the</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.220" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">you are able to redefine yourself</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.710" end="00:23:49.830" style="s2">in so doing give yourself you open up</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.270" end="00:23:58.020" style="s2">of conscience is so small that as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:23:59.970" style="s2">said some people just are not interested</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.020" end="00:24:01.620" style="s2">in being available to that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.970" end="00:24:05.310" style="s2">connection at the very least you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.620" end="00:24:08.580" style="s2">to unshackle yourself from the from the</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.580" end="00:24:12.060" style="s2">hatred towards your opponent because</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.110" end="00:24:14.160" style="s2">that is a psychologically debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.060" end="00:24:15.960" style="s2">thing to carry around with yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.160" end="00:24:19.260" style="s2">so many people and activists in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.960" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">country do but in me making that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.260" end="00:24:22.920" style="s2">practical case</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:24.420" style="s2">love and empathy as a starting point for</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.920" end="00:24:26.100" style="s2">our interactions with people on the</p>

<p begin="00:24:26.100" end="00:24:34.800" style="s2">from that is not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.110" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2">sufficient means by which I make I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.800" end="00:24:39.900" style="s2">communicate how it is you establish that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:42.510" style="s2">starting point to begin with right so in</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.900" end="00:24:43.770" style="s2">other words I can tell you it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.510" end="00:24:45.300" style="s2">idea for you to love your enemy that</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.770" end="00:24:47.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gonna feel it when</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.300" end="00:24:49.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good idea it depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.160" end="00:24:51.000" style="s2">enemy well but I know what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.560" end="00:24:52.860" style="s2">I know exactly what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.000" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">the reason that this falls on deaf ears</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.860" end="00:24:58.710" style="s2">I believe is because when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:25:00.360" style="s2">many people have the experience of some</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.710" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">enemy with whom that will not work</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.360" end="00:25:05.340" style="s2">sure and so I believe it needs an</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:07.410" style="s2">asterisk on it in order to win over</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.340" end="00:25:09.150" style="s2">those people who have ears to hear this</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.410" end="00:25:10.650" style="s2">point but have some experience that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.150" end="00:25:13.920" style="s2">tells them oh you can&#39;t do that every</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.650" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">time because you&#39;ll end up you will sow</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.920" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">the seeds of your own undoing</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:23.640" style="s2">if you attempt yeah I think that um the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:26.310" style="s2">well first of all I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.640" end="00:25:29.700" style="s2">point because it&#39;s it is the pushback</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.310" end="00:25:31.590" style="s2">that we frequently get which is well</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.700" end="00:25:33.300" style="s2">what are the limits of this right</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.590" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">because there&#39;s got to be there&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.300" end="00:25:37.620" style="s2">be a limit ultimately because some</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:39.720" style="s2">people are just unavailable to that sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.620" end="00:25:42.230" style="s2">of sort of love or sympathy or</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.720" end="00:25:42.230" style="s2">what-have-you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.800" end="00:25:49.110" style="s2">so again I know we&#39;re not disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:52.050" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a limit it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.110" end="00:25:54.930" style="s2">like you know love your enemy but only</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.050" end="00:25:56.940" style="s2">so far in fact the word love implies not</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.930" end="00:25:59.430" style="s2">that at all right that&#39;s right what it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.940" end="00:26:01.110" style="s2">means is there&#39;s a boundary it works</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.430" end="00:26:02.520" style="s2">within some zone pending certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.110" end="00:26:04.710" style="s2">assumptions that we&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.520" end="00:26:06.690" style="s2">able to specify with precision you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.710" end="00:26:08.370" style="s2">should engage in this at least as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.690" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">start and if what comes back doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.370" end="00:26:13.860" style="s2">match then you know we&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:16.230" style="s2">game theory actually that a benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.860" end="00:26:18.450" style="s2">starting point tends to sow the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.230" end="00:26:21.540" style="s2">seed on the other side but if what comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.450" end="00:26:23.130" style="s2">back is defection then that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.540" end="00:26:25.020" style="s2">well I don&#39;t want to be a sucker in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.130" end="00:26:27.540" style="s2">interaction but anyway let&#39;s put that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.020" end="00:26:29.610" style="s2">aside for the moment you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.540" end="00:26:31.920" style="s2">unfortunately done it again to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.610" end="00:26:33.670" style="s2">soliloquies in a row and you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.920" end="00:26:35.140" style="s2">introduced another</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.670" end="00:26:36.790" style="s2">and hours of stuff that we might talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.140" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">about it I don&#39;t want it to get all lost</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.790" end="00:26:40.390" style="s2">Joe so if I can go back and just point</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:43.990" style="s2">to a couple things that I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.390" end="00:26:46.060" style="s2">let&#39;s do you talked about love and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.990" end="00:26:47.350" style="s2">common starting point what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.060" end="00:26:49.600" style="s2">talk about which I have a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.350" end="00:26:51.820" style="s2">belongs in that very same conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.600" end="00:26:56.230" style="s2">is a patriotism yes which I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.820" end="00:26:58.750" style="s2">has a four people on the left it is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.230" end="00:27:01.450" style="s2">very uncomfortable connection to love</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.750" end="00:27:03.130" style="s2">but that is because the discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.450" end="00:27:05.320" style="s2">patriotism has been polluted with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.130" end="00:27:07.270" style="s2">nationalism many people regard them as</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.320" end="00:27:10.060" style="s2">synonyms I regard them as essentially</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.270" end="00:27:12.070" style="s2">antonyms even prior to Trump I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.060" end="00:27:14.470" style="s2">there was that sense of the left sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.070" end="00:27:15.790" style="s2">and so you know those on the right tend</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.470" end="00:27:19.030" style="s2">to see those on the left is unpatriotic</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.790" end="00:27:21.990" style="s2">because the left has a an arm&#39;s length</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.030" end="00:27:25.270" style="s2">relationship to patriotism at best but</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.990" end="00:27:28.060" style="s2">patriotism really is the willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.270" end="00:27:30.040" style="s2">sacrifice for something generally a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.060" end="00:27:31.930" style="s2">nation but I would argue patriotism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.040" end="00:27:35.500" style="s2">be true for you know an organization</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.930" end="00:27:37.300" style="s2">that you believe in you know your family</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.500" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">gets it automatically and we call it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.300" end="00:27:41.310" style="s2">love instead of patriotism but but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:46.440" style="s2">willingness to sacrifice for something</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.310" end="00:27:49.300" style="s2">is a key feature of human success and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.440" end="00:27:52.390" style="s2">the idea that what you are when you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.300" end="00:27:54.220" style="s2">a divide that seems unbridgeable you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.390" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">attempting to tap into a sense of hey</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.220" end="00:27:57.550" style="s2">actually even if we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:27:59.770" style="s2">fundamentally even if we can&#39;t resolve</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.550" end="00:28:01.330" style="s2">our disagreement about which direction</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.770" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">to head maybe you and I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.330" end="00:28:06.250" style="s2">be headed in opposite directions but we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:08.830" style="s2">both think that we should be headed in</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.250" end="00:28:11.230" style="s2">those directions for the good of X right</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.830" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">for the same ultimate right we both want</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.230" end="00:28:15.880" style="s2">good things for X and if I knew that X</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.690" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">was going to be served by what you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.880" end="00:28:19.390" style="s2">suggesting rather than what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:21.970" style="s2">suggesting I would go with so is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.390" end="00:28:26.230" style="s2">fundamental agreement about wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.970" end="00:28:30.250" style="s2">advance this cause or shut down that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.230" end="00:28:32.650" style="s2">cause right these things are about a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.250" end="00:28:35.830" style="s2">kind of agreement that is not analytical</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.650" end="00:28:38.200" style="s2">right yes right exactly exactly and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.830" end="00:28:42.310" style="s2">and then right and so this is the power</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.200" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">in my view of moral language properly</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.310" end="00:28:49.230" style="s2">done because it&#39;s it&#39;s got to come from</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:51.779" style="s2">I feel like the the point at which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.230" end="00:28:55.529" style="s2">make the case that we should be not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.779" end="00:28:58.519" style="s2">loving loving our opponents but that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.529" end="00:29:00.899" style="s2">ought to believe in some overarching</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.519" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">value in the American experiment that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.899" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">binds us as a people that there is such</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:08.429" style="s2">a thing as we the people to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:12.210" style="s2">it presupposes not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.429" end="00:29:14.129" style="s2">geographical proximity it presupposes an</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.210" end="00:29:16.769" style="s2">actual kind of you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.129" end="00:29:19.139" style="s2">metaphysical and idealistic connection</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.769" end="00:29:21.330" style="s2">between people something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.139" end="00:29:23.789" style="s2">potentially woven and heritage and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.330" end="00:29:26.639" style="s2">history and experience and would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.789" end="00:29:28.919" style="s2">been far more obvious to prior</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.639" end="00:29:30.779" style="s2">generations right so the first thing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.919" end="00:29:32.070" style="s2">for various reasons but just to just to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.779" end="00:29:34.440" style="s2">make the point yeah but it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.070" end="00:29:36.749" style="s2">that has to be claimed I think you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.440" end="00:29:38.669" style="s2">to sort of come out the bed and say it</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.749" end="00:29:40.289" style="s2">because I can I can argue that it would</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.669" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">be practically beneficial in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.289" end="00:29:44.340" style="s2">utilitarian sense for us to craft this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">narrative and in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.340" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">depolarization space there&#39;s been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:50.610" style="s2">of attempts to kind of think through how</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:53.220" style="s2">do you craft a narrative that works</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.610" end="00:29:55.740" style="s2">right that&#39;s able to compete with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.220" end="00:29:57.029" style="s2">you know the left-wing narrative of who</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.740" end="00:29:58.649" style="s2">we are as a country the right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.029" end="00:30:00.659" style="s2">narrative both of which are invested in</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.649" end="00:30:02.999" style="s2">making demons out of the other right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.659" end="00:30:04.830" style="s2">so that&#39;s their two bad faith narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.999" end="00:30:06.419" style="s2">two bad faith narratives exactly but but</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.830" end="00:30:08.519" style="s2">part of what makes them well what makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.419" end="00:30:11.309" style="s2">them compelling though is that in half</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.519" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2">in each having you know some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.309" end="00:30:16.889" style="s2">truth to them they do resonate in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:18.389" style="s2">emotionally real and true way with much</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.889" end="00:30:20.070" style="s2">of the experience of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.389" end="00:30:21.720" style="s2">consume those narratives but their</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.070" end="00:30:23.399" style="s2">stated in a way toward their just stated</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.720" end="00:30:25.590" style="s2">as matters of fact like just it just as</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.399" end="00:30:27.330" style="s2">a matter of fact America is a country</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.590" end="00:30:28.980" style="s2">founded in freedom and the left is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.330" end="00:30:31.169" style="s2">trying to take that freedom of a way as</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.980" end="00:30:33.419" style="s2">a matter of fact you know America is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.169" end="00:30:35.249" style="s2">country you know founded in racial</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.419" end="00:30:37.350" style="s2">injustice and folks on the right are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.249" end="00:30:38.940" style="s2">trying to perpetuate this into a new era</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.350" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">of dutiful it&#39;s like hold all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.940" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">usually exclusive exact use but and but</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:47.730" style="s2">but efforts sort of you know in the in</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:49.649" style="s2">the kind of I was gonna say in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.730" end="00:30:52.499" style="s2">center it has that I want to put aside</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.649" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">the ideological or you know yeah that by</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.499" end="00:30:56.039" style="s2">Senator conversations in the center</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:59.009" style="s2">rather than about Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.039" end="00:30:59.370" style="s2">Ka&#39;ala see conversations in the center</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.009" end="00:31:02.550" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.370" end="00:31:05.040" style="s2">not been able to produce a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.550" end="00:31:07.110" style="s2">that is similarly sort of self affirming</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.040" end="00:31:09.540" style="s2">in a morally powerful kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.110" end="00:31:11.910" style="s2">because it&#39;s all about well how can we</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.540" end="00:31:14.100" style="s2">piece by piece construct a narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.910" end="00:31:16.230" style="s2">can we can we kind of test drive it with</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.100" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">focus groups and so forth to see what</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.230" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">people respond to it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.890" style="s2">first-person kind of statement in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:25.500" style="s2">of this is who we are as a country and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.890" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">why that is similarly sort of weighty</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.500" end="00:31:30.330" style="s2">all right so I have to drag us into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:31.920" style="s2">analytic layer for a second because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.330" end="00:31:36.809" style="s2">believe that what you&#39;ve just described</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.920" end="00:31:40.110" style="s2">can be can be placed in analytical terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.809" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">that are very that are so accurate that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.110" end="00:31:46.280" style="s2">is worth having the model right on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:50.610" style="s2">table that we are wired as products of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.280" end="00:31:52.679" style="s2">evolution we are wired for both games we</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.610" end="00:31:54.390" style="s2">are wired for the bad-faith game and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.679" end="00:31:55.940" style="s2">are wired for the good-faith game and in</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:32:01.670" style="s2">fact we play these things simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.940" end="00:32:04.920" style="s2">right you have some group with which you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.670" end="00:32:07.860" style="s2">assume good faith and then some other in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.920" end="00:32:10.050" style="s2">which you don&#39;t and you you play the bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.860" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">faith game in places where you expect</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.050" end="00:32:13.530" style="s2">bad faith to dominate and you play the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:17.250" style="s2">good faith game where you think that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.530" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">can dominate but the good faith game is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.250" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">fragile mm-hmm and so the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:25.020" style="s2">have these two narratives and I love the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:26.760" style="s2">way you described them these two</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.020" end="00:32:29.490" style="s2">narratives about what the United States</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.760" end="00:32:31.220" style="s2">is right both of which have some truth</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.490" end="00:32:34.679" style="s2">the truth to them yeah right so but</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.220" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">because they are compelling and mutually</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.679" end="00:32:39.809" style="s2">exclusive they signal we are in the bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">faith game and once the brain detects we</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.809" end="00:32:42.780" style="s2">are in the bad faith game it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:44.580" style="s2">play the good faith game because to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.780" end="00:32:47.309" style="s2">so in the bad faith game is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.580" end="00:32:56.610" style="s2">sucker right and so what I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.309" end="00:33:00.030" style="s2">to you is we who do love the country for</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.610" end="00:33:04.380" style="s2">all of its flaws would love to have the</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.380" end="00:33:09.510" style="s2">are frustrated because it is too easy</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:12.890" style="s2">those who would like to play a different</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:23.390" style="s2">is much easier to break the progress</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.390" end="00:33:27.470" style="s2">it is to establish it just for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.510" style="s2">that are very much analogous to the</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.290" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">so we it&#39;s an uphill battle not because</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.750" end="00:33:54.350" style="s2">up into foster right here&#39;s a way I look</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.600" end="00:33:57.680" style="s2">at success in this in this context</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.350" end="00:33:59.480" style="s2">because I think that we we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.680" end="00:34:00.890" style="s2">of the efficacy of social movements is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.480" end="00:34:03.230" style="s2">being reflected in their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.890" end="00:34:06.170" style="s2">scale and indeed this is a space this</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.230" end="00:34:08.179" style="s2">this both that both the the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.170" end="00:34:11.480" style="s2">narrative that we&#39;re hoping takes place</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.179" end="00:34:13.550" style="s2">within within the crossfire of these two</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.480" end="00:34:15.230" style="s2">competing polarizing narratives and also</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.550" end="00:34:16.700" style="s2">the community that forms around it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.230" end="00:34:19.130" style="s2">looking for both of these things to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.700" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">reinforce each other and to amplify and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.130" end="00:34:26.300" style="s2">to expand in the context of our country</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:29.260" style="s2">but I think that part of what a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:31.220" style="s2">narrative and story does is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.260" end="00:34:33.950" style="s2">resonating in the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.220" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">people who who hear it it also provides</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.950" end="00:34:42.050" style="s2">the basis upon which an in-group is able</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.820" end="00:34:45.169" style="s2">to form and the phrase in-group I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.050" end="00:34:47.210" style="s2">can can carry with it some oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.169" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">connotations for people who here because</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.210" end="00:34:50.840" style="s2">we think well if there&#39;s an in-group</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">that that means that that in-group has</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.840" end="00:34:55.100" style="s2">no human concern for people in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:57.980" style="s2">out-group that it becomes self-serving</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.100" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">and corrupt and and and obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.980" end="00:35:03.290" style="s2">that&#39;s something that is can frequently</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.540" end="00:35:06.530" style="s2">be true but I think that in establishing</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.290" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">a core culture around these principles</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.530" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">that becomes compelling and powerful I</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:15.860" style="s2">think that what we can accomplish is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">holding a space within the country a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.860" end="00:35:20.450" style="s2">center space that can grow they can</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:23.600" style="s2">challenge the narratives on each side</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.980" end="00:35:34.190" style="s2">the past that it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.090" end="00:35:35.060" style="s2">I mean look to your point earlier there</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.190" end="00:35:37.340" style="s2">are a lot of folks who aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:39.890" style="s2">be interested in you know this this more</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.340" end="00:35:42.080" style="s2">unifying storyline and certain things</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.890" end="00:35:43.550" style="s2">are already in place now to where I</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.080" end="00:35:46.130" style="s2">think regardless of who wins the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.550" end="00:35:47.810" style="s2">presidential election in 2020 Donald</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.130" end="00:35:50.060" style="s2">Trump will either be reelected and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.810" end="00:35:51.770" style="s2">certain things that are problematic now</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.060" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">will continue to be more problematic</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.770" end="00:35:59.570" style="s2">into the future or President Trump will</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">lose but will likely continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.570" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">active as a very powerfully sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">subversive you know force in other parts</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:09.560" style="s2">of American life and I&#39;m not putting it</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">all on Trump because the issue is both</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.560" end="00:36:13.430" style="s2">Trump and the reaction to Trump in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:16.820" style="s2">view it always and always has been since</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.430" end="00:36:18.890" style="s2">these since he&#39;s come along but as the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.820" end="00:36:20.599" style="s2">consequences I think of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.890" end="00:36:24.109" style="s2">directions in which we&#39;re heading in</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.599" end="00:36:28.220" style="s2">other areas becomes clear so too I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.109" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">will the both the practical necessity</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.220" end="00:36:33.849" style="s2">but also the emotional appeal of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:37.250" style="s2">existence of a structured and organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.849" end="00:36:39.589" style="s2">community loosely structured but a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.250" end="00:36:43.180" style="s2">community that is heterodox that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.589" end="00:36:46.790" style="s2">trans partisan cross-cultural that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.180" end="00:36:48.830" style="s2">rooted in a deep faith in our transfer</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.790" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">transcendent ideals and principles I</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.830" end="00:36:54.950" style="s2">think that that that becomes a project</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:57.410" style="s2">whose appeal is potentially real and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.950" end="00:36:59.060" style="s2">scalable to a degree in the moment but</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.410" end="00:37:02.599" style="s2">that would also become more appealing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.060" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">over time even simply on the basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.599" end="00:37:06.050" style="s2">burgeoning recognition over time that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:08.540" style="s2">this is what is necessary to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.050" end="00:37:11.960" style="s2">the American project in material terms</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.540" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">at the very least alright and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.960" end="00:37:16.460" style="s2">that I think that you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.109" style="s2">look at a couple models I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.460" end="00:37:20.050" style="s2">the civil rights movement the nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.109" end="00:37:22.490" style="s2">movement in particular represents</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.050" end="00:37:24.170" style="s2">something like that I mean most people</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.490" end="00:37:25.730" style="s2">in the United States never became</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.170" end="00:37:29.960" style="s2">adherents of the nonviolent philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:32.900" style="s2">in any formal way but a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.960" end="00:37:35.720" style="s2">substantial portion of Americans did a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.900" end="00:37:37.369" style="s2">minority but a consolidated enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.720" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">minority to shift the national</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.369" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:43.829" style="s2">in a powerful way and the broader sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:47.970" style="s2">of cultural ripples that came from that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.829" end="00:37:50.519" style="s2">have been pervasive in our sort of in up</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.970" end="00:37:52.440" style="s2">until our up until largely our modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.519" end="00:37:54.750" style="s2">time in a way that is redefined the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.440" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">we look at ourselves as a nation even</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.750" end="00:37:57.869" style="s2">for people who are never at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.730" style="s2">epicenter of that movement or don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.869" end="00:38:02.730" style="s2">a direct sort of memory of what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.730" end="00:38:04.200" style="s2">substance of that was so the ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.730" end="00:38:06.690" style="s2">conception of a social movement is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.200" end="00:38:09.269" style="s2">something that explodes quickly that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.690" end="00:38:12.059" style="s2">hits the national conscious like a like</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.269" end="00:38:13.859" style="s2">a like a tidal wave and is able to break</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.059" end="00:38:15.960" style="s2">a bunch of things and allow for things</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.859" end="00:38:18.450" style="s2">to be rebuilt in the aftermath</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.960" end="00:38:20.490" style="s2">potentially or reformed but that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.450" end="00:38:22.349" style="s2">conception is also an unwieldy one</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.490" end="00:38:25.140" style="s2">there&#39;s another view of what a social</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.349" end="00:38:27.510" style="s2">movement can be that is more like a tree</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.140" end="00:38:29.099" style="s2">that you nourish with seeds that begins</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.510" end="00:38:30.869" style="s2">to grow and over the course of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.099" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">become sort of a mighty oak in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.869" end="00:38:34.890" style="s2">middle of in the middle of the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:38.730" style="s2">something that is stable and enduring</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.890" end="00:38:40.740" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s kind of how I begin to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.730" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">conceptualize what the substance of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.740" end="00:38:45.990" style="s2">deeper more morally rooted and again</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">sort of you know heterodox and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.990" end="00:38:52.289" style="s2">cross-cultural movement that to me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:55.859" style="s2">sort of what success in that vein begins</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.289" end="00:38:57.720" style="s2">to look like over time okay mmm I agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.859" end="00:39:00.089" style="s2">with what you said</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.720" end="00:39:02.309" style="s2">the hidden tribes report which you are</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.790" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">what powerful entities attempt to do so</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.340" end="00:40:06.470" style="s2">the question really to me is can those</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:10.280" style="s2">who are struggling to regain the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.470" end="00:40:12.440" style="s2">patriotic Center defeat whatever force</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.280" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">it is either by bringing them on board</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.440" end="00:40:20.990" style="s2">with the patriotic mmm narrative or by</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:24.050" style="s2">overpowering them can we rebuild that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.990" end="00:40:25.880" style="s2">patriotic Center and I want to return to</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.050" end="00:40:28.340" style="s2">something you said earlier which I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.880" end="00:40:32.740" style="s2">has a great deal of meaning to it you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.340" end="00:40:37.460" style="s2">argued something about people signalling</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.740" end="00:40:38.869" style="s2">with their policy preferences more than</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.460" end="00:40:41.390" style="s2">actually attempting to change something</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.869" end="00:40:44.270" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen this as well and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.390" end="00:40:46.070" style="s2">it has to do with another pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.270" end="00:40:48.470" style="s2">expression of concern as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.070" end="00:40:50.359" style="s2">substance of concern right and so if to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.470" end="00:40:52.910" style="s2">use the the language of the heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.359" end="00:40:55.490" style="s2">movement they&#39;re virtually signals right</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.910" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">and virtually signaling for the point of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.490" end="00:41:01.070" style="s2">some personal social gain rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s a phenomenon of right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.070" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">left just it&#39;s a phenomenon of both</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.070" style="s2">right and left however I believe it</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:08.930" style="s2">arose from something and we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.070" end="00:41:13.099" style="s2">evidence of this in the recent political</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.930" end="00:41:15.800" style="s2">past people do not relate to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.099" end="00:41:18.050" style="s2">that they collectively have any power</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.800" end="00:41:19.849" style="s2">people feel powerless and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.050" end="00:41:22.160" style="s2">wrong to feel powerless they have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.849" end="00:41:25.420" style="s2">largely powerless for some reason that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.160" end="00:41:28.430" style="s2">nobody has quite put their finger on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.420" end="00:41:31.580" style="s2">policy of the nation seems to continue</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.430" end="00:41:33.560" style="s2">on even as the administration in power</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.580" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">flips from one side to the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.560" end="00:41:38.330" style="s2">something has created a an unstoppable</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:40.849" style="s2">train that heads in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.330" end="00:41:42.859" style="s2">almost no matter what Trump being one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.849" end="00:41:48.109" style="s2">the first things to disrupt this in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.859" end="00:41:51.320" style="s2">recent memory but in any case the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.109" end="00:41:53.450" style="s2">of being powerless of being asked to</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.320" end="00:41:55.670" style="s2">vote as if it was very important and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.450" end="00:41:57.950" style="s2">actually having very little impact when</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:42:00.170" style="s2">you pull the lever means that people</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.950" end="00:42:01.550" style="s2">have started to utilize the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.170" end="00:42:03.770" style="s2">of an election for something else</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.550" end="00:42:04.280" style="s2">they&#39;re venting right and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.770" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">things we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.280" end="00:42:11.330" style="s2">particularly with brexit in the UK was</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">that people voted for brexit and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.330" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">many of the people who voted for it were</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:17.570" style="s2">shocked their sense was yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">know I think this happened a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.570" end="00:42:23.270" style="s2">with Trump - were very angry about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:24.680" style="s2">Democratic Party having handed them</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.270" end="00:42:26.930" style="s2">Hillary Clinton and I was one of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.680" end="00:42:28.670" style="s2">people who was angry about that but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.930" end="00:42:30.590" style="s2">I did not vote for Trump but many people</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.670" end="00:42:32.240" style="s2">did vote for Trump thinking well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.590" end="00:42:33.890" style="s2">not gonna win they effectively thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.240" end="00:42:37.310" style="s2">they were casting a protest right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.890" end="00:42:39.860" style="s2">then holy moley they&#39;ve put this guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.310" end="00:42:42.050" style="s2">with his finger on the button and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.860" end="00:42:45.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like a very good idea good</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.050" end="00:42:46.970" style="s2">news guys your vote counts there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.320" end="00:42:50.570" style="s2">news and there&#39;s bad news your vote</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.970" end="00:42:53.300" style="s2">counts and your vote counts but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.570" end="00:42:56.270" style="s2">anyway I think the sense of we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.300" end="00:42:58.430" style="s2">hovering in a space where in general we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.270" end="00:43:00.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have any power but our power isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.430" end="00:43:02.180" style="s2">actually zero and so every so often</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.470" end="00:43:04.070" style="s2">people are exercising their power and</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.180" end="00:43:06.410" style="s2">they&#39;re discovering well I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.070" end="00:43:08.150" style="s2">vote against the European Union I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.410" end="00:43:10.580" style="s2">to thumb my nose at the European Union</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.150" end="00:43:13.100" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t want to leave it right I</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.580" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">meant to tell them I wanted to leave it</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.100" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">they were like storming out threatening</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.950" style="s2">a divorce that they didn&#39;t intend to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:21.950" style="s2">carry through with or something but but</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.950" end="00:43:23.780" style="s2">anyway so that&#39;s the question a can we</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.950" end="00:43:25.700" style="s2">fix the political system so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.780" end="00:43:28.550" style="s2">stop for - signaling because if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.700" end="00:43:30.650" style="s2">actually did have power it would cause</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.550" end="00:43:32.300" style="s2">people to sober up with respect to their</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.650" end="00:43:32.810" style="s2">virtue signaling which has gotten out of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.300" end="00:43:36.470" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.810" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">mm-hmm so anyway I&#39;ll leave it there and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.470" end="00:43:42.650" style="s2">let you as well yeah and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:45.020" style="s2">the I&#39;ve always I&#39;ve always looked at</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.650" end="00:43:47.540" style="s2">polarization you know the vicious</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.020" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">affective polarization that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.540" end="00:43:51.260" style="s2">experiencing this country today tribal</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:54.830" style="s2">polarization manifesting in political</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.260" end="00:43:58.220" style="s2">divides I&#39;ve I&#39;ve always looked at that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.830" end="00:44:01.400" style="s2">as essentially the the core the central</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.220" end="00:44:03.170" style="s2">structural problem in American politics</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.400" end="00:44:05.030" style="s2">and maybe just society more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.170" end="00:44:06.920" style="s2">speaking and this is a connection I</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.030" end="00:44:09.110" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to make and a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.920" end="00:44:10.490" style="s2">basic one and easy not easy to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.110" end="00:44:11.630" style="s2">understand what you what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.490" end="00:44:14.150" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.630" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">some folks are not concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.150" end="00:44:16.970" style="s2">problem of political and social</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:17.580" style="s2">polarization because they feel it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.970" end="00:44:19.380" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.580" end="00:44:21.780" style="s2">focus on the structural issues affecting</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.380" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">society you know the oligarchic way in</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.780" end="00:44:24.630" style="s2">which special interests run our</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">government regardless of the votes being</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.630" end="00:44:30.540" style="s2">cast problems with systems from criminal</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.610" style="s2">justice to health care to you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.540" end="00:44:35.340" style="s2">corporate relationship between any</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.610" end="00:44:36.570" style="s2">number of things but regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.340" end="00:44:39.660" style="s2">whether or not your issue is climate</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.570" end="00:44:42.150" style="s2">change immigration gun violence etc any</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.660" end="00:44:43.650" style="s2">enduring sort of policy solution to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.150" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">these problems is going to depend on</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.650" end="00:44:46.860" style="s2">there being a consensus between people</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:48.870" style="s2">of different points of views and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.860" end="00:44:51.660" style="s2">partisan affiliations and that consensus</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.870" end="00:44:56.010" style="s2">is itself going to be subject subject to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.660" end="00:44:57.750" style="s2">the relative social consensus and unity</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.010" end="00:44:59.510" style="s2">that exists within the American people</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.750" end="00:45:02.490" style="s2">sufficient to be able to motivate</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:04.170" style="s2">politicians to vote and interact with</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.490" end="00:45:07.830" style="s2">each other in a collaborative sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.170" end="00:45:09.540" style="s2">way and so you can&#39;t solve in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.830" end="00:45:11.430" style="s2">you can&#39;t solve global warming unless</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.540" end="00:45:14.070" style="s2">you get a broad cross-section of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.430" end="00:45:15.840" style="s2">people on board with a palatable policy</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.070" end="00:45:18.180" style="s2">solution and you can&#39;t do that unless</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.840" end="00:45:19.620" style="s2">you have a cultural shift that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.180" end="00:45:21.330" style="s2">possible for us to see each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.620" end="00:45:22.980" style="s2">something other than enemies is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.330" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">something something other than villains</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.980" end="00:45:28.680" style="s2">so I certainly you know one starting</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:30.810" style="s2">point for beginning to consolidate this</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.680" end="00:45:32.490" style="s2">movement is by making the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.810" end="00:45:35.310" style="s2">case that even if we&#39;re just looking at</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.490" end="00:45:39.000" style="s2">it as a practical matter you know we</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.310" end="00:45:41.310" style="s2">have to we have to be serious about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.000" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">question how do we establish you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.310" end="00:45:45.930" style="s2">social consensus and what is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:49.110" style="s2">relationship of that to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.930" end="00:45:51.030" style="s2">social bonds in a in a society but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.110" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">think that if you accomplish that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.030" end="00:45:57.660" style="s2">said the you set the the preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:00.390" style="s2">necessary for the establishing of a new</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.660" end="00:46:02.910" style="s2">center of leverage to begin to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.390" end="00:46:04.350" style="s2">move the existing structures around in</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.910" end="00:46:06.170" style="s2">such a way or to reform the existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.350" end="00:46:08.430" style="s2">structures in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.170" end="00:46:11.370" style="s2">counteracts the sorts of trends that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.430" end="00:46:13.260" style="s2">you&#39;re that you&#39;re identifying so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.370" end="00:46:15.240" style="s2">identifying this high level structural</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.260" end="00:46:18.090" style="s2">problem where people feel as if their</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.240" end="00:46:19.980" style="s2">participation in democracy doesn&#39;t count</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.090" end="00:46:22.410" style="s2">and all we can think to do is to throw a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.980" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">wrench in the system what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.410" end="00:46:28.500" style="s2">that if we were to rediscover our deeper</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:30.040" style="s2">bonds with each other on a social and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.500" end="00:46:32.380" style="s2">social context</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:35.500" style="s2">we could establish the unity necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.380" end="00:46:37.510" style="s2">necessary to begin to leverage that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.500" end="00:46:39.430" style="s2">against some of these existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.510" end="00:46:42.430" style="s2">structures because as you say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.430" end="00:46:45.250" style="s2">predicated on division and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.430" end="00:46:47.349" style="s2">you robbed them of that advantage then</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.250" end="00:46:49.030" style="s2">the equation changes but again it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.349" end="00:46:50.230" style="s2">catch-22 because how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.030" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">given the fact that they have the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.230" end="00:46:53.380" style="s2">advantage already and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.520" end="00:46:56.349" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely what it is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.380" end="00:46:58.030" style="s2">alternately trying to work out here so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.349" end="00:47:01.930" style="s2">have thoughts on that but is there</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.030" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">anything in that Oh jump on so much so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.930" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">think we are in an interesting pickle I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.460" end="00:47:11.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve mentioned this to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:13.890" style="s2">but years ago my good friend David Lodi</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.050" end="00:47:16.900" style="s2">and I wrote a paper on the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.890" end="00:47:19.300" style="s2">morality and morality is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.900" end="00:47:23.619" style="s2">puzzle because morality essentially</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.300" end="00:47:26.440" style="s2">involves people not taking opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.619" end="00:47:28.089" style="s2">that to a first approximation look like</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.440" end="00:47:31.500" style="s2">they would be Ellucian airily profitable</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.089" end="00:47:35.260" style="s2">right not acting on impulses for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.500" end="00:47:35.770" style="s2">the paper was titled the better angels</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.260" end="00:47:38.589" style="s2">of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.770" end="00:47:42.250" style="s2">obviously alluding to the same quote</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.250" end="00:47:50.050" style="s2">any case the paper put forward a model</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.160" end="00:47:52.950" style="s2">in which essentially as the threat to an</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.050" end="00:47:57.910" style="s2">entity grows the tendency to put aside</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.950" end="00:48:00.280" style="s2">the ability to profit at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.910" end="00:48:05.170" style="s2">others within the entity grows with it</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.280" end="00:48:06.970" style="s2">and as success is achieved the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.170" end="00:48:11.020" style="s2">to behave benevolently to other members</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.970" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">of that entity decreases right so in</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.020" end="00:48:14.410" style="s2">essence sorry I was actually as we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.150" end="00:48:15.700" style="s2">writing the paper I was explaining to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.410" end="00:48:18.310" style="s2">somebody who asked me what I was working</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.700" end="00:48:20.380" style="s2">on and they you know somebody without it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.310" end="00:48:22.420" style="s2">was not scientifically oriented and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.380" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">described this model to them and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.420" end="00:48:27.849" style="s2">said oh when times are good people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:29.589" style="s2">bad okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.849" end="00:48:33.510" style="s2">once again evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.589" end="00:48:38.470" style="s2">rediscovers folk wisdom but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.510" end="00:48:40.420" style="s2">why are we facing peoples why given that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.470" end="00:48:42.460" style="s2">times are actually quite uncertain now</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.420" end="00:48:44.110" style="s2">our people</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.460" end="00:48:45.550" style="s2">the power model would predict they would</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.110" end="00:48:46.630" style="s2">be more patriotic rather than less</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.550" end="00:48:48.100" style="s2">patriotic that they would put aside</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.630" end="00:48:50.170" style="s2">their differences and pull in the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.100" end="00:48:52.420" style="s2">direction as they do during war but</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.170" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">here&#39;s what I think is going on that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.420" end="00:48:56.320" style="s2">have two things in play how much</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:49:00.100" style="s2">jeopardy do you feel like you&#39;re in but</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.320" end="00:49:02.320" style="s2">we feel a lot of Jeopardy right and with</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.100" end="00:49:04.780" style="s2">whom are you collaborating so in other</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.320" end="00:49:08.040" style="s2">words what you have is a thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.780" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">patriotic over in the red space right</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.040" end="00:49:13.360" style="s2">fighting an enemy which is the blue and</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:16.390" style="s2">the blue folks are patriotic against the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.360" end="00:49:17.950" style="s2">red they see an enemy within America and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.390" end="00:49:22.300" style="s2">they are fighting it even though this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.950" end="00:49:24.220" style="s2">nonsense not nonsense but the the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.300" end="00:49:26.080" style="s2">that each one sees on the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.220" end="00:49:28.630" style="s2">actually a very tiny and consequential</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.080" end="00:49:30.730" style="s2">thing it&#39;s not the core of the people on</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.630" end="00:49:33.820" style="s2">the other side um there&#39;s a germ of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.730" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">truth in the perception but it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.820" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">magnified into this bogeyman that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:42.520" style="s2">of proportion to its actual reality I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:44.650" style="s2">think in each case so the upshot of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.520" end="00:49:46.690" style="s2">is to do any of the more you believe</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.650" end="00:49:49.180" style="s2">that the more true it becomes but but</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.690" end="00:49:51.070" style="s2">right it&#39;s a positive feedback so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.180" end="00:49:53.140" style="s2">point is the more divided we get the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.070" end="00:49:54.670" style="s2">heart of the job gets of reversing</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.140" end="00:49:56.830" style="s2">course and collaborating at a larger</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.670" end="00:49:59.020" style="s2">scale and this is in part I think why</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.830" end="00:50:00.370" style="s2">the radicalize one another yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.020" end="00:50:04.210" style="s2">radicalize each other that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.370" end="00:50:07.600" style="s2">right this is why though the right has</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.210" end="00:50:11.530" style="s2">the particular misapprehension that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.600" end="00:50:13.450" style="s2">has about I don&#39;t want to say climate</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.530" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">because I think the climate puzzle is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.450" end="00:50:21.070" style="s2">complex but about sustainability so when</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">I talk to people on the right and I say</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.070" end="00:50:26.380" style="s2">something about a sustainability crisis</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">they hear climate right they are primed</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.380" end="00:50:31.300" style="s2">to hear those things as synonymous I</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">can&#39;t escape it man my feeling is I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.300" end="00:50:34.870" style="s2">we have a sustainability crisis I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:37.300" style="s2">believe we have a climate crisis but if</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.870" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">the climate crisis isn&#39;t real we still</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.300" end="00:50:41.110" style="s2">have a sustainability problem right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:43.300" style="s2">we&#39;re you know if the climate crisis</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.110" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t real we got lucky on the climate</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.300" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">front it&#39;s not that we didn&#39;t behave in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.800" end="00:50:47.380" style="s2">a way that could have caused a climate</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:49.840" style="s2">problem but the core of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.380" end="00:50:51.730" style="s2">remains right the core problem is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.840" end="00:50:53.500" style="s2">behaving in a massively unsustainable</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.730" end="00:50:54.940" style="s2">way and this will not go on very long we</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.500" end="00:50:55.470" style="s2">will destroy ourselves through one</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.940" end="00:50:56.940" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.470" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">or another no matter what we do and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.940" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">of course that should galvanize not only</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:05.849" style="s2">Americans across left and right it</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:08.820" style="s2">should galvanize the world right now if</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.849" end="00:51:13.109" style="s2">you&#39;re on the right the idea of an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.820" end="00:51:16.349" style="s2">so large that we would be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.109" end="00:51:19.050" style="s2">galvanize at a global level is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.349" end="00:51:21.630" style="s2">frightening because of frankly some very</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.050" end="00:51:23.580" style="s2">real fears that exist for meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.630" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">reasons on the right about you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.580" end="00:51:28.369" style="s2">global power structures so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:31.320" style="s2">that you fear government as the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.369" end="00:51:33.960" style="s2">properly does to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.320" end="00:51:35.640" style="s2">fear government the idea of bigger more</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.960" end="00:51:38.220" style="s2">powerful government at larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.640" end="00:51:39.690" style="s2">scale is even more frightening the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.220" end="00:51:42.210" style="s2">solution is almost worse than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.690" end="00:51:43.859" style="s2">problem or maybe nice and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.210" end="00:51:45.690" style="s2">are many cases in which the right is</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.859" end="00:51:47.580" style="s2">actually correct about this that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.690" end="00:51:49.109" style="s2">solution is worth worse than the problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.580" end="00:51:51.660" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that the problem isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.109" end="00:51:53.640" style="s2">it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a way it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.660" end="00:51:56.280" style="s2">inevitable that if you attempt to build</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.640" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">if you attempt to architect solutions</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.280" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">you&#39;re going to create unintended</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:03.960" style="s2">consequences that you didn&#39;t see coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:05.640" style="s2">so because of that one has to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.960" end="00:52:07.109" style="s2">cautious in the building you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.640" end="00:52:08.369" style="s2">discover what those consequences are you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.109" end="00:52:09.690" style="s2">have to figure out how to mitigate them</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.369" end="00:52:11.790" style="s2">and sometimes you have to realize out</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.690" end="00:52:13.380" style="s2">solving that problem wasn&#39;t worth it now</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.790" end="00:52:15.960" style="s2">in the case of a global sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.380" end="00:52:18.570" style="s2">crisis I don&#39;t know and you have a spare</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:02.490" style="s2">is that has to be done very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.430" end="00:53:04.170" style="s2">and the meaningfully getting people to</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.840" end="00:53:24.900" style="s2">inconceivable that it could work but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.370" end="00:53:26.790" style="s2">think there are many hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.900" end="00:53:29.220" style="s2">away well but you pointed to something</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.790" end="00:53:31.650" style="s2">earlier which I thought was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.220" end="00:53:34.500" style="s2">enough to flag because you said that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.650" end="00:53:36.090" style="s2">given the uncertainty in our society</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.500" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">right now you might think under normal</p>

<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:48.650" style="s2">loaded on one side of the partisan</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.260" end="00:53:51.420" style="s2">spectrum or the other thoughts you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.650" end="00:53:54.990" style="s2">perpetuating our division but I actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.420" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">think that what we&#39;re seeing is probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.990" end="00:53:58.890" style="s2">more in accord with the predictions of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.970" style="s2">your model than not that you knows times</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.890" end="00:54:06.230" style="s2">are good people like bad and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.970" end="00:54:08.970" style="s2">because there&#39;s the strange sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.230" end="00:54:12.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this strange sort of paradox I</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.970" end="00:54:15.510" style="s2">think in the way we see and feel life in</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.600" end="00:54:17.430" style="s2">America today which is which is both</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.410" end="00:54:44.280" style="s2">is it&#39;s a big problem many places but</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.750" end="00:54:46.950" style="s2">you know problems are all always</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.280" end="00:54:49.290" style="s2">relative right relatively speaking you</p>

<p begin="00:54:54.450" end="00:54:58.710" style="s2">moment in which on the one hand we are</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.220" end="00:55:06.960" style="s2">Pinker&#39;s thesis is that this is the best</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.550" end="00:55:39.720" style="s2">have a heightened sort of consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.830" end="00:57:32.600" style="s2">and in that in so doing we wind up</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.070" end="00:58:24.550" style="s2">here yep you know and there is something</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.380" end="00:58:29.320" style="s2">you know whatever it is I do feel a kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.550" end="00:58:32.200" style="s2">of kinship with you and a few others but</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.320" end="00:58:33.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of sense of I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:58:38.260" end="00:58:45.010" style="s2">man I&#39;ve never read it I read it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.080" end="00:58:46.990" style="s2">I know but there&#39;s a at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.010" end="00:58:48.010" style="s2">the book I don&#39;t want to spoil it for</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.990" end="00:58:49.390" style="s2">you man oh go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.010" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">okay I&#39;m gonna spoil a little tiny bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.390" end="00:58:53.170" style="s2">okay okay the earth is actually I</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:58.590" style="s2">promise to forget okay good</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.170" end="00:59:00.670" style="s2">wonderful the earth is a an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.590" end="00:59:02.590" style="s2">solve the riddle of life the universe</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.670" end="00:59:04.840" style="s2">and everything right so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.590" end="00:59:06.970" style="s2">computer that tried to do it and it came</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.840" end="00:59:09.460" style="s2">up with okay 42 and that didn&#39;t satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.970" end="00:59:13.180" style="s2">people so they the earth is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.460" end="00:59:15.010" style="s2">explore the question and the earth is</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.180" end="00:59:17.050" style="s2">about to be destroyed to put a</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.010" end="00:59:21.340" style="s2">hyperspace bypass through the sector</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.050" end="00:59:29.230" style="s2">eminent domain right exactly galactic</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.340" end="00:59:30.730" style="s2">eminent domain yeah so anyway the earth</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.230" end="00:59:33.310" style="s2">is about to be destroyed but of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.730" end="00:59:34.450" style="s2">the earth is this project to discover</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.310" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">the meaning of life the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.450" end="00:59:38.440" style="s2">everything and that meaning arises in</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:40.180" style="s2">the mind of a young woman who suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.440" end="00:59:43.420" style="s2">realizes what the meaning of life the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.180" end="00:59:45.340" style="s2">universe and everything is right and she</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.420" end="00:59:47.140" style="s2">picks up the phone to deliver the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.340" end="00:59:49.300" style="s2">message right as the earth is destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.140" end="00:59:54.520" style="s2">so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.300" end="00:59:56.950" style="s2">how it&#39;s maybe even cosmically destined</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.520" end="00:59:58.840" style="s2">that upon discovery mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.950" end="01:00:01.300" style="s2">information won&#39;t even get out or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.840" end="01:00:04.330" style="s2">that&#39;s dumb luck but but anyway my point</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.300" end="01:00:07.630" style="s2">is there is something resonant in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.330" end="01:00:09.640" style="s2">story for me because I feel like you</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.630" end="01:00:11.650" style="s2">know maybe I&#39;m wrong maybe we&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.640" end="01:00:13.870" style="s2">better off than I think we are but you</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.650" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">know I&#39;m not just guessing that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.870" end="01:00:16.540" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:20.280" style="s2">mm-hmm I spent a lot of time studying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.540" end="01:00:23.250" style="s2">figure out how complex systems work and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.280" end="01:00:25.810" style="s2">this complex system is in grave danger</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.250" end="01:00:27.120" style="s2">for very simple reasons because of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.810" end="01:00:29.230" style="s2">amount of power we have at our disposal</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.120" end="01:00:31.300" style="s2">relative to the amount of wisdom we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.230" end="01:00:33.700" style="s2">to control it right yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.300" end="01:00:36.040" style="s2">so the point is if you are somewhere on</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.700" end="01:00:38.860" style="s2">earth and you&#39;ve spotted that problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.040" end="01:00:41.380" style="s2">mm-hmm then it&#39;s like you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.860" end="01:00:43.210" style="s2">Titanic hurtling into the North Atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.380" end="01:00:45.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s not going to last and the point</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.210" end="01:00:47.710" style="s2">as well is there anything to be done</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.940" end="01:00:48.850" style="s2">about it or am I gonna end up picking up</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.710" end="01:00:51.130" style="s2">the phone with the answer to life the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.850" end="01:00:56.350" style="s2">universe and everything and right well</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.130" end="01:00:58.330" style="s2">right well so we mentioned the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.350" end="01:01:00.790" style="s2">dynamic of self-fulfilling prophecy at</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.330" end="01:01:03.640" style="s2">play in all of this if you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.790" end="01:01:05.470" style="s2">right you know my feeling is that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.640" end="01:01:07.810" style="s2">left is not as bad as you&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.470" end="01:01:09.550" style="s2">if you&#39;re on the left I would say the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.810" end="01:01:11.530" style="s2">right is not as bad as you&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.550" end="01:01:13.750" style="s2">but the more you think that that is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.530" end="01:01:15.640" style="s2">case about the other side the more you</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.750" end="01:01:17.410" style="s2">are going to treat them accordingly the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.640" end="01:01:18.550" style="s2">more they&#39;re going to react to you in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.410" end="01:01:20.410" style="s2">way that&#39;s going to make them more</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.550" end="01:01:22.990" style="s2">sympathetic with the worst the worst</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.410" end="01:01:24.490" style="s2">angels let&#39;s say or with the demons of</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.990" end="01:01:25.960" style="s2">not only their own nature but it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.490" end="01:01:27.570" style="s2">to make them more sympathetic with those</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.960" end="01:01:29.350" style="s2">people in their groups who are already</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.570" end="01:01:31.600" style="s2">particularly radicalized</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.350" end="01:01:35.110" style="s2">and who are maybe as bad as you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.600" end="01:01:37.810" style="s2">think and so you know the polarization</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.110" end="01:01:39.340" style="s2">pushes people on the right closer to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.810" end="01:01:41.230" style="s2">alt-right people on the left closer to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.340" end="01:01:43.210" style="s2">mt anti-fog so forth all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.230" end="01:01:46.510" style="s2">gradations and then of course on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.210" end="01:01:49.870" style="s2">other in the other context you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.510" end="01:01:52.360" style="s2">world is not as bad off as we think but</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.870" end="01:01:54.580" style="s2">if we assume that it is you know that it</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.360" end="01:01:56.470" style="s2">is this is just the most in just time to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.580" end="01:01:58.120" style="s2">be alive in America or the United States</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.470" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">there we&#39;re going to act with the sort</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.120" end="01:02:02.440" style="s2">of desperation you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:04.540" style="s2">yeah that is going to cause us to virtue</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.440" end="01:02:06.520" style="s2">signal to put solutions on the table</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.540" end="01:02:07.840" style="s2">that are meant to polarize and not to</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.520" end="01:02:09.460" style="s2">solve things that it&#39;s going to push us</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.840" end="01:02:12.040" style="s2">towards all the negative inevitabilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.460" end="01:02:14.560" style="s2">that we imagine but become more and more</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.040" end="01:02:17.050" style="s2">real on the basis of our fears but this</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.560" end="01:02:18.790" style="s2">is why I started off actually by talking</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.050" end="01:02:20.200" style="s2">about the importance of a unifying</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.790" end="01:02:22.630" style="s2">narrative being something that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.200" end="01:02:24.940" style="s2">ultimately declared in sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.630" end="01:02:26.080" style="s2">first-person kind of way because I do</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.940" end="01:02:28.300" style="s2">believe that there is a positive</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.080" end="01:02:32.200" style="s2">reinforcing cycle to be triggered in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.300" end="01:02:34.600" style="s2">much the same way and you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.200" end="01:02:37.570" style="s2">understand if this comes across in a way</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.600" end="01:02:39.730" style="s2">of if this comes across as me saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.570" end="01:02:41.320" style="s2">something along the lines of you know I</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.730" end="01:02:43.120" style="s2">was from a faith-based perspective if</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.320" end="01:02:44.710" style="s2">you believe something you know it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.120" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">become it&#39;ll become real you know we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.710" end="01:02:48.370" style="s2">just need to manifest and attract a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:50.050" style="s2">better America and so forth but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.370" end="01:02:53.140" style="s2">but there&#39;s a more grounded way to put</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.050" end="01:02:55.690" style="s2">this I think which is to say that in my</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.140" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">conversation here with you Brit and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.690" end="01:02:59.050" style="s2">think it is substantively important for</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:03.130" style="s2">me to put this in personal terms</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.050" end="01:03:05.290" style="s2">actually but you know I&#39;m a if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.130" end="01:03:08.440" style="s2">just speaking on the levels of level of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.290" end="01:03:12.060" style="s2">labels you know I&#39;m a black Christian</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.440" end="01:03:15.130" style="s2">Republican you know and you are a</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.060" end="01:03:17.170" style="s2">progressive I don&#39;t know if you refer to</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:19.630" style="s2">yourself as atheist or agnostic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.170" end="01:03:21.280" style="s2">say a theist I don&#39;t say agnostic yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.630" end="01:03:22.450" style="s2">don&#39;t give you a label that does not</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.280" end="01:03:24.130" style="s2">hear if it doesn&#39;t fit but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.450" end="01:03:25.510" style="s2">skeptic it would that be would that be a</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.130" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">real I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.510" end="01:03:28.660" style="s2">supernatural going on in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">most people would call me an atheist</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.660" end="01:03:32.170" style="s2">understood understood</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:33.700" style="s2">so a person who other people might refer</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.170" end="01:03:35.770" style="s2">to as an atheist you are politically</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.700" end="01:03:38.260" style="s2">politically progressive I think you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.770" end="01:03:40.840" style="s2">white guy as well okay some days I am</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.260" end="01:03:42.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m not it depends how people feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.840" end="01:03:48.460" style="s2">about Jews I guess right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.490" end="01:03:49.630" style="s2">I for me though you are a person who and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.460" end="01:03:50.980" style="s2">believe the point of this is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.630" end="01:03:52.630" style="s2">flattery as a matter of fact just for</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.980" end="01:03:55.270" style="s2">people listening I am lying in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.630" end="01:03:58.210" style="s2">moment just to make a point but you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.270" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">what is best in America right hell yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.210" end="01:04:03.400" style="s2">I knew it somewhere deep down I knew it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:05.380" style="s2">that&#39;s why I said I was lying to be jump</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.400" end="01:04:08.590" style="s2">off the mica never know how I really</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.380" end="01:04:12.220" style="s2">feel but I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.590" end="01:04:12.900" style="s2">individual who genuinely does believe I</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.220" end="01:04:14.730" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.900" end="01:04:16.350" style="s2">in in Liberty and you have your</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.730" end="01:04:17.940" style="s2">conception of what that looks like in</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.350" end="01:04:20.190" style="s2">practice but you believe in the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.940" end="01:04:22.500" style="s2">you believe in the idea of equality and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.190" end="01:04:24.060" style="s2">justice before the law but on a kinetic</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.500" end="01:04:26.070" style="s2">sort of level there&#39;s nothing in our</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.060" end="01:04:28.260" style="s2">labels or our appearances that keep us</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.070" end="01:04:30.210" style="s2">from looking at each other and just sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.260" end="01:04:31.500" style="s2">of intuiting pretty quickly on the basis</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.210" end="01:04:34.560" style="s2">of little bit of conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.500" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper bomb there that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.560" end="01:04:39.480" style="s2">know even without even having any</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:41.640" style="s2">sustained personal interaction we can</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.480" end="01:04:44.070" style="s2">tell that there&#39;s a level of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.640" end="01:04:46.830" style="s2">level of commonality that allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.070" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">be basically trusting of one another</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.830" end="01:04:51.480" style="s2">enough to explore deeper levels of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:52.560" style="s2">friendship and collaboration and even if</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.480" end="01:04:55.650" style="s2">we never got to that point</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.560" end="01:04:57.540" style="s2">person-to-person it&#39;s because the groups</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.650" end="01:04:59.970" style="s2">that we come from all these different</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.540" end="01:05:01.530" style="s2">label differences right while there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.970" end="01:05:04.080" style="s2">differences between all these categories</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.530" end="01:05:07.590" style="s2">we exist within a larger sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.080" end="01:05:10.080" style="s2">cultural and historical context that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.590" end="01:05:12.390" style="s2">allows us even without thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.080" end="01:05:14.190" style="s2">I think as Americans to make something</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.390" end="01:05:17.040" style="s2">of an assumption day by day</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.190" end="01:05:18.930" style="s2">and and again this is less true for some</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.040" end="01:05:21.630" style="s2">folks and more true for others but</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.930" end="01:05:24.690" style="s2">certainly in my case and yours I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.630" end="01:05:27.090" style="s2">that we&#39;re largely predisposed towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.690" end="01:05:28.560" style="s2">thinking that you know I walk into a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.090" end="01:05:30.420" style="s2">supermarket with a bunch of people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.560" end="01:05:32.370" style="s2">look like Bret Weinstein I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:05:33.210" end="01:05:38.100" style="s2">is someone who isn&#39;t basically</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.500" end="01:05:46.200" style="s2">these labels signify to me signify any</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.950" end="01:05:48.330" style="s2">level of difference that would overwhelm</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.200" end="01:05:51.450" style="s2">the larger sort of category of</p>

<p begin="01:05:54.210" end="01:05:59.880" style="s2">more particularly Americans who have</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.760" end="01:06:02.070" style="s2">some basic sort of consensus over the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.880" end="01:06:04.410" style="s2">importance of these unifying ideals</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.070" end="01:06:06.540" style="s2">you know beneath what I would like for</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.410" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">the label American to actually mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.540" end="01:06:15.870" style="s2">and so in in declaring that you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:19.410" style="s2">part of the the the power of politics</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.870" end="01:06:22.050" style="s2">and statesmanship well done is that it</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.410" end="01:06:26.339" style="s2">introduces I think kind of an axiomatic</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.050" end="01:06:28.680" style="s2">language of moral and cultural saw</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.339" end="01:06:30.930" style="s2">garetty that needs to be filled in right</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.680" end="01:06:32.339" style="s2">I mean you know the the lofty rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.930" end="01:06:34.949" style="s2">needs to be filled in with an</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.339" end="01:06:36.959" style="s2">appreciation of historical context and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.949" end="01:06:40.410" style="s2">where idea our ideals come from</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.959" end="01:06:43.410" style="s2">but even that is substantively suffused</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.410" end="01:06:45.660" style="s2">by the experiences that we share in in</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.410" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">in debating over these things and</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.660" end="01:06:49.410" style="s2">fighting for them and working together</p>

<p begin="01:06:51.719" end="01:06:59.489" style="s2">and so forth and so I want to get people</p>

<p begin="01:06:59.489" end="01:07:04.499" style="s2">knee-jerk skepticism or cynicism towards</p>

<p begin="01:07:27.239" end="01:07:30.929" style="s2">difficulty in order to be at the point</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.219" end="01:07:33.749" style="s2">to where Steven Pinker&#39;s basic premise</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.929" end="01:07:34.979" style="s2">is still right at this very moment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.749" end="01:07:37.619" style="s2">stand we&#39;re standing on the edge of a</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.619" end="01:07:41.729" style="s2">completely gone off it yet just</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.390" end="01:07:44.489" style="s2">teetering looking over we&#39;re still at a</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.729" end="01:07:45.809" style="s2">lofty height in terms of everything that</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.489" end="01:07:47.400" style="s2">we have to be thankful for both</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.809" end="01:07:50.849" style="s2">materially and socially and culturally</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.400" end="01:07:51.769" style="s2">as a country so I want to stop you right</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.849" end="01:07:55.739" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.769" end="01:07:57.660" style="s2">there&#39;s something additional which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.739" end="01:07:59.549" style="s2">that the the force I mentioned the force</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.660" end="01:08:03.900" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t want us to unite that wants</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.549" end="01:08:05.910" style="s2">us to be divided that force introduces</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.900" end="01:08:09.719" style="s2">something into the conversation on both</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.910" end="01:08:11.640" style="s2">sides which I consider particularly</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.719" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">diabolical and I know you will have seen</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.640" end="01:08:20.159" style="s2">it too which is the implication that to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:22.619" style="s2">engage people on the other side is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:25.949" style="s2">invite some kind of danger or to</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.619" end="01:08:29.130" style="s2">contaminate yourself yeah morally and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.949" end="01:08:32.009" style="s2">what that does is it causes people not</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.130" end="01:08:34.139" style="s2">to be able to hear you not to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.009" end="01:08:36.389" style="s2">detect your humanity because they fear</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.139" end="01:08:40.109" style="s2">that if they were to give you a chance</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.389" end="01:08:42.450" style="s2">that it would suddenly make</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.109" end="01:08:45.120" style="s2">the enemy to the people on whom they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.450" end="01:08:48.150" style="s2">depending mm-hmm and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.120" end="01:08:49.680" style="s2">the the biggest hazard to the project</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.150" end="01:08:53.070" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.680" end="01:08:56.960" style="s2">creation of this heterodox central</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.070" end="01:09:01.350" style="s2">conversation the biggest hazard is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.960" end="01:09:03.480" style="s2">the normal mechanisms that allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.350" end="01:09:06.530" style="s2">detect who we might have a productive</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.480" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">conversation with have been unhooked my</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.530" end="01:09:10.730" style="s2">forces we can&#39;t see that would really</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:12.150" style="s2">rather we not have that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.730" end="01:09:13.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.150" end="01:09:16.620" style="s2">that&#39;s that well that&#39;s absolutely true</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.800" end="01:09:18.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s why in a lot of our language</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.620" end="01:09:20.550" style="s2">and better angels we talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.240" end="01:09:23.100" style="s2">that we are that we are red and blue</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.550" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">together right look at our website</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.100" end="01:09:26.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a phrase in there somewhere that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:29.520" style="s2">says that we are red and blue together</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.490" end="01:09:31.470" style="s2">in a working alliance and but I&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.520" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">from my vantage point it&#39;s why the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.470" end="01:09:36.540" style="s2">why the term American has to become</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">bigger and stronger and more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.540" end="01:09:39.960" style="s2">more resonant than that in the phrases</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:43.140" style="s2">you know Republican Democrat or</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.960" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">conservative and liberal again right the</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.140" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">it&#39;s okay for us to have these</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:49.530" style="s2">categories but the only reason I even</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:51.720" style="s2">mention your labels and my labels I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.530" end="01:09:53.550" style="s2">on a more fundamental level you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.720" end="01:09:55.260" style="s2">we&#39;re Brent and John and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.550" end="01:09:57.060" style="s2">more that&#39;s what&#39;s more important the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.260" end="01:09:59.790" style="s2">labels are always faulty approximations</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.060" end="01:10:02.670" style="s2">of what we really are in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.790" end="01:10:04.200" style="s2">essence but the reason it was important</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.670" end="01:10:06.570" style="s2">for me to mention those labels is to</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.200" end="01:10:08.280" style="s2">demonstrate the fact just by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.570" end="01:10:11.220" style="s2">our being here having this type of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.280" end="01:10:14.430" style="s2">conversation that there is a greater</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.220" end="01:10:17.010" style="s2">sort of shared identity or soil of</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.430" end="01:10:19.080" style="s2">values between us that transcends those</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.010" end="01:10:21.240" style="s2">things and so in the work of better</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.080" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">angels we&#39;ve highlighted we literally</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.240" end="01:10:24.300" style="s2">have a phrase for it red and blue pairs</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:27.210" style="s2">if you look at our social media</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.300" end="01:10:29.580" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;ll we&#39;ll post testimonials</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.210" end="01:10:30.570" style="s2">from people who have pairs of</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.580" end="01:10:32.280" style="s2">individuals who have developed</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.570" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">friendships across this right-left</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.280" end="01:10:38.550" style="s2">divide but the reason we do that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:40.350" style="s2">thing is to challenge precisely the kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.550" end="01:10:42.840" style="s2">of you know toxic norm that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.350" end="01:10:44.790" style="s2">pointing to which says that you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.840" end="01:10:47.670" style="s2">sacrificing something in yourself or</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.790" end="01:10:50.070" style="s2">betraying your team by daring to have a</p>

<p begin="01:10:53.620" end="01:10:58.630" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make the case that not</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.050" end="01:11:00.370" style="s2">only are you not selling out anyone on</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.630" end="01:11:03.460" style="s2">your side but you&#39;re developing a more</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.370" end="01:11:06.280" style="s2">accurate sense of just who your side</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.460" end="01:11:09.340" style="s2">really is that is to say that your side</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.280" end="01:11:11.890" style="s2">is a not to be if you&#39;re really going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.340" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">live up to the best of left or right the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.890" end="01:11:16.900" style="s2">American side and that American actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:20.740" style="s2">means something this isn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.900" end="01:11:22.270" style="s2">generic descriptor but you know but but</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.740" end="01:11:24.490" style="s2">but I do think that the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.270" end="01:11:28.720" style="s2">project done to to create and motivate</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.490" end="01:11:31.150" style="s2">and scale this this broader movement has</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.720" end="01:11:33.310" style="s2">to be again in revisiting this question</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.150" end="01:11:35.440" style="s2">of what makes us what makes us an</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.310" end="01:11:38.770" style="s2">American people what is this nation</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.440" end="01:11:42.670" style="s2">really in its essence and to introduce</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.770" end="01:11:44.580" style="s2">into the conversational landscape and</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.670" end="01:11:47.710" style="s2">the broader political conversation a</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.580" end="01:11:50.920" style="s2">narrative that drills into this point</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.710" end="01:11:54.070" style="s2">and is able to dislodge the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.920" end="01:11:56.140" style="s2">essential sort of duopoly that you have</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.070" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">between these two polarizing status quos</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.140" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">and so in that in this vein actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:04.870" style="s2">were we&#39;re currently launching well we</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:08.050" style="s2">will be launching the spring of 2020 our</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.030" end="01:12:14.830" style="s2">hit the stop and so from one part of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.390" end="01:12:19.620" style="s2">country to the next I&#39;ll actually be</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.830" end="01:12:22.900" style="s2">giving be giving speeches where I</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.620" end="01:12:26.620" style="s2">attempt to the utmost of my power to</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.660" end="01:12:41.590" style="s2">exist on each side of this divide and to</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.000" end="01:12:44.290" style="s2">weave these elements together into a</p>

<p begin="01:12:46.420" end="01:12:50.860" style="s2">basis for an answer to the question what</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.940" end="01:12:54.040" style="s2">does it mean to be an American and who</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.860" end="01:12:57.130" style="s2">we are and who are we as a country but</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.040" end="01:12:59.140" style="s2">in doing that what we will also be doing</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.130" end="01:13:01.960" style="s2">at these at these events across the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.140" end="01:13:03.850" style="s2">country is holding community debates</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.960" end="01:13:06.239" style="s2">that precede these speeches were and we</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.850" end="01:13:08.310" style="s2">invite people from across the aisle</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.239" end="01:13:09.840" style="s2">the local community so I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.310" end="01:13:11.850" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be and we&#39;re likely to be in</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:16.710" style="s2">Los Angeles in Nashville and Minnesota</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.850" end="01:13:18.690" style="s2">and and North Carolina and in different</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.710" end="01:13:20.760" style="s2">places and in each stop we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.690" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">bring people together to have a better</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.760" end="01:13:24.270" style="s2">angels debate on this question what does</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:28.130" style="s2">it mean to be an American or something</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.270" end="01:13:31.560" style="s2">to that effect and the the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.130" end="01:13:34.110" style="s2">the the nature of our debate programs</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.560" end="01:13:36.060" style="s2">that first of all it&#39;s a parliamentary</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.110" end="01:13:37.830" style="s2">style debate it&#39;s not just people sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.060" end="01:13:40.890" style="s2">of screaming at each other on a panel or</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.830" end="01:13:42.330" style="s2">what not be a madam chairperson you</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.890" end="01:13:45.090" style="s2">address your questions to the chair and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.330" end="01:13:47.010" style="s2">so forth and but our debates are</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.090" end="01:13:49.800" style="s2">designed not to focus on winning and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.010" end="01:13:51.960" style="s2">losing or scoring polemic appoints it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.800" end="01:13:55.170" style="s2">an invitation to the American people</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.960" end="01:13:57.840" style="s2">ultimately the people who participate to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.170" end="01:14:00.390" style="s2">speak in candid terms about why they</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.840" end="01:14:01.739" style="s2">what why they about why they believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.390" end="01:14:03.810" style="s2">what they believe about a given issue</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.739" end="01:14:06.210" style="s2">and the in this case what does it mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.810" end="01:14:08.070" style="s2">to be an American but to also be honest</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.210" end="01:14:10.170" style="s2">and upfront and comfortable reflecting</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.070" end="01:14:14.160" style="s2">upon their doubts and their</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.170" end="01:14:16.860" style="s2">uncertainties with respect to their view</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.160" end="01:14:18.750" style="s2">or their opinion on this question and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.860" end="01:14:20.969" style="s2">it&#39;s a debate structure that invites</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.750" end="01:14:23.190" style="s2">reflection and focuses on intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.969" end="01:14:25.290" style="s2">humility in a collaborative search for</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.190" end="01:14:28.590" style="s2">truth that extends across the aisle</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.290" end="01:14:31.230" style="s2">right and so our hope is to kick off</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.590" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">this larger conversation to bring the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.230" end="01:14:36.860" style="s2">American people into it in a direct way</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:39.570" style="s2">and hopefully and this is our ambition</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.860" end="01:14:42.390" style="s2">to ultimately bring the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.570" end="01:14:44.070" style="s2">attention to this conversation necessary</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.390" end="01:14:45.750" style="s2">to scale up this fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.070" end="01:14:49.380" style="s2">conversation about who we are as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.750" end="01:14:52.500" style="s2">people across the country in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.380" end="01:14:54.420" style="s2">can impact what is otherwise going to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.500" end="01:14:56.670" style="s2">just a terribly vicious presidential</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.420" end="01:14:59.210" style="s2">election that something that has the</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.670" end="01:15:01.710" style="s2">potential I think to rip apart what</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.210" end="01:15:05.550" style="s2">solidarity we have left in the center of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.710" end="01:15:08.370" style="s2">our our cultural core as Americans so</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.550" end="01:15:10.710" style="s2">the this is going to be an effort at</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.370" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">creating a centripetal force in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.710" end="01:15:18.060" style="s2">social consciousness and it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:18.810" style="s2">hands on deck right but I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.060" end="01:15:21.120" style="s2">moment that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.810" end="01:15:23.070" style="s2">going into because it will take us</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:26.700" style="s2">closer to the common sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.070" end="01:15:28.080" style="s2">appreciation of the real enemy that is</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.700" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">threatening all of us in this country</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.080" end="01:15:32.430" style="s2">which is to say really just sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:36.690" style="s2">worst angels of our nature ourselves or</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.430" end="01:15:38.340" style="s2">our eagerness to tear things apart that</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.690" end="01:15:40.050" style="s2">are valuable meaningful in this country</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.340" end="01:15:43.650" style="s2">just for the sake of getting back at the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.050" end="01:15:46.080" style="s2">other side at the end of the day I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.650" end="01:15:50.370" style="s2">that the moment that we will be in will</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:52.770" style="s2">be perhaps paradoxically as things do</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.370" end="01:15:57.240" style="s2">get seem to get bad right in certain</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.770" end="01:15:58.770" style="s2">areas the most opportune moment for</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.240" end="01:16:00.720" style="s2">something good to take place and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.770" end="01:16:05.670" style="s2">take shape in the heart of that you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.720" end="01:16:07.110" style="s2">and so I think that in what it is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.670" end="01:16:10.590" style="s2">and I are discussing here this question</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.110" end="01:16:14.340" style="s2">of how we consolidate this new space and</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.590" end="01:16:16.590" style="s2">grow it I think that timing is also you</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.340" end="01:16:18.300" style="s2">know a factor here because none of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.590" end="01:16:20.310" style="s2">are static questions all these questions</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.300" end="01:16:22.080" style="s2">are moving they&#39;re all in flow and flux</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.310" end="01:16:25.890" style="s2">and I think that the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.080" end="01:16:29.460" style="s2">web space has done something tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.890" end="01:16:32.460" style="s2">and providing a broad landscape upon</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.460" end="01:16:34.590" style="s2">which we can sort of loosen the garments</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.460" end="01:16:38.790" style="s2">of our partisan and tribal affiliations</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.590" end="01:16:41.490" style="s2">in a common pursuit pursuit of truth in</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.790" end="01:16:44.460" style="s2">a react we essence to the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.490" end="01:16:48.120" style="s2">reason and objectivity to allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.460" end="01:16:50.370" style="s2">explore both deeper similarities and a</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.120" end="01:16:52.740" style="s2">deeper understanding of complex material</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.370" end="01:16:54.510" style="s2">and social phenomenon and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.740" end="01:16:58.770" style="s2">what is left to be added to that</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.510" end="01:17:02.340" style="s2">potentially is a unearthing of our</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.770" end="01:17:05.490" style="s2">shared sort of cultural and moral sort</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.340" end="01:17:07.800" style="s2">of sort of foundation as a people in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.490" end="01:17:10.560" style="s2">way that takes a heterodox conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.800" end="01:17:12.660" style="s2">and routes this energy into the forming</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.560" end="01:17:14.520" style="s2">of a consolidated sense of transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.660" end="01:17:17.730" style="s2">identity and I think that if we can</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.520" end="01:17:21.030" style="s2">accomplish that then regardless of who</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.730" end="01:17:24.030" style="s2">wins in 2020 there will be a stabilizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.030" end="01:17:27.420" style="s2">and grounded social and political force</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.030" end="01:17:30.420" style="s2">in the United States that can begin to</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.420" end="01:17:32.579" style="s2">establish some leverage over the over</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.420" end="01:17:36.030" style="s2">the competing but also</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.579" end="01:17:38.159" style="s2">firstly collaborative polarizing media</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.030" end="01:17:41.639" style="s2">party and corporate corporate structures</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:43.619" style="s2">in America that are so invested in in</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.639" end="01:17:44.639" style="s2">sowing the seeds of division to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.619" end="01:17:47.189" style="s2">their own power</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.639" end="01:17:50.189" style="s2">I think the counterbalance could be</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.189" end="01:17:51.599" style="s2">established over the oddly enough over</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.189" end="01:17:53.219" style="s2">the course of the most divisive campaign</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.599" end="01:17:53.789" style="s2">in American history that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.219" end="01:17:56.099" style="s2">hoping for</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.789" end="01:18:00.179" style="s2">I love this idea and I agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.099" end="01:18:03.899" style="s2">that the what you have at the moment is</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.179" end="01:18:06.329" style="s2">an unpredictable landscape and that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.899" end="01:18:08.519" style="s2">the moment in which something new and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.329" end="01:18:10.019" style="s2">quite positive could emerge and if</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.519" end="01:18:13.079" style="s2">nothing new and positive emerges I</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.019" end="01:18:16.829" style="s2">expect it will go the other direction so</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.079" end="01:18:20.510" style="s2">at a personal level as an atheist</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.829" end="01:18:25.619" style="s2">adjacent person let me say Godspeed and</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.510" end="01:18:29.489" style="s2">if I can talk to my audience I think if</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.619" end="01:18:31.619" style="s2">you can hear what John is saying and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.489" end="01:18:34.469" style="s2">speaks to you which I imagine it will</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.619" end="01:18:37.409" style="s2">you should make a point of going to see</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.469" end="01:18:38.309" style="s2">one of these events if it is in your</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.409" end="01:18:42.689" style="s2">neck of the woods</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.309" end="01:18:45.929" style="s2">because the sense of camaraderie that</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.689" end="01:18:47.909" style="s2">arises out of a meeting of the minds</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.929" end="01:18:53.669" style="s2">between people who don&#39;t come from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.909" end="01:18:57.109" style="s2">same the same team is it is incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.669" end="01:18:59.639" style="s2">rewarding and it is also incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.109" end="01:19:01.289" style="s2">reassuring to discover that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.639" end="01:19:05.999" style="s2">narratives we&#39;ve been handed about other</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.289" end="01:19:08.189" style="s2">people and their their failure to to</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.999" end="01:19:09.689" style="s2">rise to the standards of humanity or</p>

<p begin="01:19:09.689" end="01:19:14.309" style="s2">other that to the extent that these</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.550" end="01:19:16.709" style="s2">events are designed to short-circuit</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.309" end="01:19:21.719" style="s2">that process and to jumpstart a better</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.719" end="01:19:27.269" style="s2">yeah they can also be joyful I mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.079" end="01:19:30.780" style="s2">there is a ridiculous amount of joy</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.269" end="01:19:34.139" style="s2">actually in in this work there there</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.780" end="01:19:38.369" style="s2">really is and you know so my fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:19:38.369" end="01:19:42.059" style="s2">are in the idea that we can accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.719" end="01:19:43.739" style="s2">this right stems from the fact that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.059" end="01:19:45.880" style="s2">really do believe that there&#39;s just sort</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.739" end="01:19:47.800" style="s2">of there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.880" end="01:19:50.620" style="s2">sort of I think an evolutionary momentum</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.800" end="01:19:54.969" style="s2">that ultimately sort of attends to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.620" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">more subtle but also more durable bonds</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.969" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">of social consolidation that happens</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:04.239" style="s2">through our positive connections I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:07.270" style="s2">you know hatred and fear and chaos are</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.239" end="01:20:09.940" style="s2">very obvious phenomenons and social life</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.270" end="01:20:12.750" style="s2">that quickly catalyze social momentum</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.940" end="01:20:16.989" style="s2">but again it&#39;s fractured and it leads to</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.750" end="01:20:19.929" style="s2">dissolution and deterioration but the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.989" end="01:20:23.110" style="s2">other but the the the antithesis of that</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.929" end="01:20:24.670" style="s2">is sort of the the substance of good</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.110" end="01:20:27.429" style="s2">will the webs of good will that allow us</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.670" end="01:20:29.159" style="s2">to actually order ourselves socially in</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.429" end="01:20:31.719" style="s2">a way that does not necessarily relate</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.719" end="01:20:36.730" style="s2">chiefly on force but arises from an</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:38.889" style="s2">internal motivation for us to treat each</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.730" end="01:20:42.159" style="s2">other in a certain way because at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.889" end="01:20:45.250" style="s2">end of the day we are also wired for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.159" end="01:20:48.310" style="s2">good-faith game as you said and there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.250" end="01:20:51.130" style="s2">something there&#39;s something simply</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.310" end="01:20:54.070" style="s2">satisfying about rediscovering these</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.130" end="01:20:57.429" style="s2">bonds and the idea that you know the the</p>

<p begin="01:20:57.429" end="01:21:03.190" style="s2">let us say can be extended far beyond</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.960" end="01:21:11.949" style="s2">that already exist between us would go</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.829" end="01:23:30.369" style="s2">similarly I think that the America of</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.389" end="01:23:32.550" style="s2">our of our of our children&#39;s generation</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.369" end="01:23:34.899" style="s2">you and I both have young children</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.550" end="01:23:36.129" style="s2">you&#39;re about 50 years older than I am so</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.899" end="01:23:38.139" style="s2">your kids are a little older than mine</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.129" end="01:23:44.559" style="s2">I&#39;m 50 years older than you that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.139" end="01:23:46.629" style="s2">a thing like no problems five or ten but</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.559" end="01:23:49.570" style="s2">um the America of our children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.629" end="01:23:52.030" style="s2">generation similarly is going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.570" end="01:23:54.969" style="s2">product yes of the chaos and</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.030" end="01:23:57.369" style="s2">polarization of you know the the Obama</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.969" end="01:23:59.169" style="s2">years and the Trump years and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.369" end="01:24:01.059" style="s2">but it&#39;s also going to be a product of</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.169" end="01:24:04.959" style="s2">the types of conversations and</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.059" end="01:24:07.689" style="s2">connections and and intellectual and</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.959" end="01:24:10.090" style="s2">social and moral shifts that you and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.689" end="01:24:11.230" style="s2">and so many others across this heterodox</p>

<p begin="01:24:11.230" end="01:24:16.270" style="s2">working on now and so it gives us reason</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.770" end="01:24:19.150" style="s2">to kind of look to the future</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.270" end="01:24:21.400" style="s2">with a realistic assessment of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.150" end="01:24:23.080" style="s2">that appreciation of the fact that on</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.400" end="01:24:25.750" style="s2">the one hand certain things perhaps have</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.080" end="01:24:28.600" style="s2">already been done in our society that</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.750" end="01:24:32.260" style="s2">will have to play out right I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.600" end="01:24:34.750" style="s2">you know how what the fallout is from</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.260" end="01:24:36.370" style="s2">from certain patterns we hope will be</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.750" end="01:24:39.340" style="s2">substantially mitigated by the positive</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.370" end="01:24:41.500" style="s2">things that we hope to engender but one</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.340" end="01:24:43.390" style="s2">way or another they&#39;re just as there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.500" end="01:24:44.739" style="s2">momentum to the negative and the chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.390" end="01:24:46.720" style="s2">things that are happening in America</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.739" end="01:24:49.390" style="s2">right now so to our is there a momentum</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.720" end="01:24:52.690" style="s2">to the constructive movements that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.390" end="01:24:55.660" style="s2">swelling up beneath us even as we speak</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.690" end="01:24:57.550" style="s2">and you know that momentum is going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.660" end="01:25:00.850" style="s2">come to a head to something constructive</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.550" end="01:25:03.460" style="s2">will come about and I&#39;m confident that</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.850" end="01:25:05.560" style="s2">it will endure to something that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.460" end="01:25:07.690" style="s2">a legacy that we&#39;re able to leave to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.560" end="01:25:10.690" style="s2">next generation of woods and wine</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.690" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">Stein&#39;s you know that comes along so</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.690" end="01:25:16.750" style="s2">well can I go back you raised the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:19.480" style="s2">specter of communism yeah and I feel is</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.750" end="01:25:21.970" style="s2">well worth saying that I am NOT nor have</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.480" end="01:25:23.950" style="s2">I ever been a member of the Communist</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.970" end="01:25:27.850" style="s2">Party no okay I was a little nervous</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.950" end="01:25:31.570" style="s2">there so actually there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.850" end="01:25:34.450" style="s2">family history there where we faced that</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.570" end="01:25:37.570" style="s2">particular McCarthy estat</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.450" end="01:25:40.120" style="s2">but I do want to point out that you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.570" end="01:25:42.760" style="s2">this conversation is now back about</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.120" end="01:25:46.870" style="s2">things like communism of all that of all</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.760" end="01:25:49.180" style="s2">referent ways of being and I want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.870" end="01:25:52.570" style="s2">just put what I believe to be the right</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.180" end="01:25:54.880" style="s2">answer here on the table because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.570" end="01:25:59.710" style="s2">better than fighting the caricatures</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.880" end="01:26:03.460" style="s2">sure I think people&#39;s fear of communism</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.710" end="01:26:06.820" style="s2">is on the one hand cartoonish and on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.460" end="01:26:08.290" style="s2">other hand accurate enough I understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.820" end="01:26:10.480" style="s2">what the fear is there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.290" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2">communism simply doesn&#39;t function based</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.480" end="01:26:16.690" style="s2">on game theory and that those who wish</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:19.239" style="s2">to engage in that particular utopian</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.690" end="01:26:22.810" style="s2">experiment are inviting a failure mode</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.239" end="01:26:24.580" style="s2">or one of several on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.810" end="01:26:27.340" style="s2">think this can be said</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.580" end="01:26:29.860" style="s2">of essentially all of the named</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.340" end="01:26:32.620" style="s2">ideologies that we find on the map and</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.860" end="01:26:35.440" style="s2">what we are in fact discovering is that</p>

<p begin="01:26:35.440" end="01:26:43.810" style="s2">work and that we are in need of a</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.520" end="01:26:56.620" style="s2">and then it ends in catastrophe if you</p>

<p begin="01:26:56.620" end="01:27:00.580" style="s2">figure out which portion of the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.600" end="01:27:02.620" style="s2">held by which of these ideological</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.580" end="01:27:05.350" style="s2">factions and then figure out again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.620" end="01:27:08.610" style="s2">a question of admixture how do you take</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.350" end="01:27:10.480" style="s2">the values from this system and</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.610" end="01:27:13.750" style="s2">disassociate them as much as possible</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.480" end="01:27:16.030" style="s2">with the costs on that system and blend</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.750" end="01:27:17.980" style="s2">these things so that we get a system in</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.030" end="01:27:19.990" style="s2">which we get you&#39;re not going to get a</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.980" end="01:27:22.000" style="s2">hundred percent of the benefits imagined</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.990" end="01:27:26.050" style="s2">in any of them but you can get a large</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.000" end="01:27:30.610" style="s2">fraction if you join them correctly and</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.050" end="01:27:33.100" style="s2">so in essence that recognition that yes</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.610" end="01:27:35.440" style="s2">the Communists are wrong right so are</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.100" end="01:27:37.570" style="s2">the libertarians right the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.440" end="01:27:39.760" style="s2">these entities are wrong is an</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.570" end="01:27:42.940" style="s2">invitation for all of us to have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.760" end="01:27:44.770" style="s2">discussion about well which portion is</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.940" end="01:27:47.200" style="s2">correct and which portion turned out not</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.770" end="01:27:48.580" style="s2">to be true and what do we do about that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.200" end="01:27:53.710" style="s2">knowledge once we figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.580" end="01:27:55.240" style="s2">to me that is a very exciting moment to</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.710" end="01:27:57.640" style="s2">live in if we can have that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.240" end="01:28:00.430" style="s2">which is the one I hear you trying to</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.640" end="01:28:03.400" style="s2">catalyze if we can have that</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.430" end="01:28:05.980" style="s2">conversation then the future might be</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.400" end="01:28:10.000" style="s2">very bright and we can figure out how to</p>

<p begin="01:28:52.240" end="01:28:56.290" style="s2">perspectives allows us to arrive at the</p>

<p begin="01:28:59.010" end="01:29:07.600" style="s2">the truth of that points us towards a a</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.110" end="01:29:22.240" style="s2">is the idea that these structures that</p>

<p begin="01:30:21.880" end="01:30:25.840" style="s2">has tended to be in American history and</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.490" end="01:30:27.400" style="s2">then in some respects is threatened</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.840" end="01:30:29.890" style="s2">today of course but that nevertheless</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.400" end="01:30:33.390" style="s2">has generally been on left and right a</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.890" end="01:30:35.530" style="s2">common appreciation of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.390" end="01:30:38.070" style="s2">self-governance as part of the heritage</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.530" end="01:30:40.950" style="s2">of our people but our ability to do that</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.070" end="01:30:44.860" style="s2">rests on our fidelity to the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.950" end="01:30:48.130" style="s2">reasoned deliberation is the means by</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.860" end="01:30:49.540" style="s2">which we are able to take subjective</p>

<p begin="01:30:55.210" end="01:31:01.600" style="s2">and there is a constitutional structure</p>

<p begin="01:31:01.600" end="01:31:06.370" style="s2">say that maybe it should be amended more</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.120" end="01:31:08.650" style="s2">easily than it has been maybe not this</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.370" end="01:31:11.320" style="s2">conversation to be had over that but</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.650" end="01:31:14.740" style="s2">nevertheless on a structural level it</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.320" end="01:31:17.110" style="s2">returns us to the idea that there are be</p>

<p begin="01:31:17.110" end="01:31:21.670" style="s2">society for the importance of the rule</p>

<p begin="01:31:27.490" end="01:31:32.350" style="s2">social level there need be a similar</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.620" end="01:31:34.270" style="s2">respect paid towards the idea that part</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.350" end="01:31:37.660" style="s2">of the very substance of liberty and</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.270" end="01:31:40.060" style="s2">equality itself is the freedom for us to</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.660" end="01:31:42.310" style="s2">be able to interact with one another in</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.060" end="01:31:45.820" style="s2">the area of reasoned discourse and</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.310" end="01:31:47.890" style="s2">deliberation in in politics per se and</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.820" end="01:31:51.730" style="s2">every other aspect of our lives which</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.890" end="01:31:53.770" style="s2">lends meaning to the idea of equality on</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.730" end="01:31:59.020" style="s2">a social level in the first place right</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.770" end="01:32:01.180" style="s2">in other words reason is the in in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.020" end="01:32:04.600" style="s2">pursuit of really the pursuit of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.180" end="01:32:09.430" style="s2">pursuit of truth is part of the fuel</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.600" end="01:32:12.010" style="s2">that animates the fuel that drives our</p>

<p begin="01:32:12.010" end="01:32:15.700" style="s2">culture and so when we ask this question</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.260" end="01:32:17.610" style="s2">what does it mean to be an American I</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.700" end="01:32:20.740" style="s2">believe that part of the answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.610" end="01:32:24.040" style="s2">is a belief in the power of logic and</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.740" end="01:32:26.170" style="s2">reason and conversation to allow us to</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.040" end="01:32:29.260" style="s2">work together in a constructive and a</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.170" end="01:32:31.480" style="s2">collaborative way so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.260" end="01:32:32.680" style="s2">practical argument to be made for what</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.480" end="01:32:34.960" style="s2">it is you&#39;re talking about the synthetic</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.680" end="01:32:37.480" style="s2">approach to finding a more viable</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.960" end="01:32:40.210" style="s2">philosophical way forward out of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.480" end="01:32:43.180" style="s2">admixture of our various philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.210" end="01:32:46.060" style="s2">and ideological starting points but that</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.180" end="01:32:48.520" style="s2">process itself is something that I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.060" end="01:32:51.100" style="s2">descends to us in part from an American</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.520" end="01:32:53.620" style="s2">heritage that at its core is committed</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.100" end="01:32:56.080" style="s2">to the ideals that that yield that and</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.620" end="01:32:59.980" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the story that needs</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.080" end="01:33:01.690" style="s2">to be told is that we are a perhaps were</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.980" end="01:33:02.660" style="s2">not always a reasonable people as</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.690" end="01:33:04.880" style="s2">Americans</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.660" end="01:33:07.310" style="s2">but it is in us to seek to be that it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.880" end="01:33:09.980" style="s2">part of our heritage to believe in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.310" end="01:33:11.630" style="s2">power of that you know this nation</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.980" end="01:33:13.430" style="s2">nation was formed through deliberative</p>

<p begin="01:33:24.170" end="01:33:29.690" style="s2">know and that&#39;s actually a wonderfully</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.200" end="01:33:32.330" style="s2">inspiring thing to imagine that men can</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.690" end="01:33:35.480" style="s2">bring their ideals to a process to a</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.330" end="01:33:37.130" style="s2">project of forming a community that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:33:49.370" end="01:33:54.020" style="s2">part of what we need to do so would you</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.170" end="01:33:56.570" style="s2">would you join me in the sentiment that</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.020" end="01:34:02.210" style="s2">extremism in pursuit of reasonableness</p>

<p begin="01:34:04.810" end="01:34:09.290" style="s2">maybe force people to be reasonable we</p>

<p begin="01:34:54.170" end="01:35:00.650" style="s2">speaking I mean again there&#39;s sort of a</p>

<p begin="01:35:00.650" end="01:35:06.290" style="s2">and groups that are seeking to not only</p>

<p begin="01:36:42.439" end="01:36:47.329" style="s2">has been lacking is the consolidation</p>

<p begin="01:37:07.219" end="01:37:11.599" style="s2">is tended in the direction of trying to</p>

<p begin="01:38:07.939" end="01:38:13.809" style="s2">think what the President did is very</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.679" end="01:38:18.169" style="s2">troubling that on the other hand mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.809" end="01:38:20.659" style="s2">basically he famously speaks</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.169" end="01:38:24.909" style="s2">off-the-cuff and says really apologize</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.659" end="01:38:26.839" style="s2">and to take this one too impeachment</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.909" end="01:38:28.639" style="s2">frankly I&#39;m not sure what the right</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.839" end="01:38:31.029" style="s2">thing to do is because it is obviously</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.639" end="01:38:33.439" style="s2">very troubling to have a president imply</p>

<p begin="01:40:51.530" end="01:40:56.270" style="s2">encourage people about his just not be</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.560" end="01:40:59.360" style="s2">so obsessed with Donald Trump and look</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.270" end="01:41:04.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not that he&#39;s not an important you</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.360" end="01:41:06.590" style="s2">know figure in all of this he is and but</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.280" end="01:41:09.739" style="s2">Trump would not exist if we were not for</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.590" end="01:41:11.869" style="s2">pre-existing patterns is a symptom he</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.739" end="01:41:13.520" style="s2">really is a symptom and and and some</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.869" end="01:41:16.699" style="s2">people want to push back against that</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.520" end="01:41:20.150" style="s2">but anybody who sees him as the root</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.699" end="01:41:22.820" style="s2">cause of these larger problems is on the</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.150" end="01:41:24.320" style="s2">one hand therefore I think going to act</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.820" end="01:41:26.389" style="s2">in a way to where they&#39;re going to seek</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.320" end="01:41:28.520" style="s2">a short-term solution to the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.389" end="01:41:31.460" style="s2">Donald Trump which is likely not even to</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.520" end="01:41:33.199" style="s2">be effective and that might be oh what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.460" end="01:41:35.510" style="s2">happened I hear with this emerge this on</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.199" end="01:41:37.070" style="s2">these these people are so focused on</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.510" end="01:41:39.949" style="s2">Trump that they have the sense that if</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.070" end="01:41:41.480" style="s2">we can just deal with that problem that</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.949" end="01:41:44.239" style="s2">we will be somewhere and the fact is we</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.480" end="01:41:47.780" style="s2">would be nowhere but even if but even if</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.239" end="01:41:50.900" style="s2">they succeeded in that in that effort it</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.780" end="01:41:52.909" style="s2">would likely result in a you know it</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.900" end="01:41:54.830" style="s2">would likely be attended by more or less</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.909" end="01:41:55.760" style="s2">the deafness to the to the broader and</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.830" end="01:41:56.900" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.760" end="01:41:59.180" style="s2">concerns which brought him about in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.900" end="01:42:01.250" style="s2">first place which will therefore lead to</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.180" end="01:42:03.320" style="s2">a continuation of those subtlety and</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.250" end="01:42:05.060" style="s2">trend will still be here 20 years down</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.320" end="01:42:07.040" style="s2">the road one way or another because</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.060" end="01:42:08.600" style="s2">somebody you know craft you&#39;re smarter</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.040" end="01:42:10.340" style="s2">than the president saw and so forth will</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.600" end="01:42:13.310" style="s2">come back the other way and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.340" end="01:42:15.590" style="s2">a similar thing to conservatives who</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.310" end="01:42:18.620" style="s2">believe that because look actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.590" end="01:42:20.330" style="s2">precisely parallel for many Republicans</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.620" end="01:42:23.300" style="s2">and conservatives including a good many</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.330" end="01:42:24.680" style="s2">who would never who would tell you</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.300" end="01:42:26.210" style="s2">pretty readily that they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.680" end="01:42:28.460" style="s2">they don&#39;t want their kids to look to</p>

<p begin="01:42:28.460" end="01:42:35.090" style="s2">felt that there needed to be a a strong</p>

<p begin="01:43:23.900" end="01:43:27.260" style="s2">arrived at within the American people</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.580" end="01:43:28.850" style="s2">themselves there&#39;s a political</p>

<p begin="01:43:28.850" end="01:43:32.930" style="s2">had on top of that which I think allows</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.070" end="01:43:38.360" style="s2">for quite a bit of room for disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.930" end="01:43:42.500" style="s2">right you know but for there to be sort</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.360" end="01:43:44.870" style="s2">of a revival in our democratic or</p>

<p begin="01:43:50.210" end="01:43:56.150" style="s2">upon which we will be able to absorb the</p>

<p begin="01:43:56.150" end="01:44:00.500" style="s2">might be elected to office who is more</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.160" end="01:44:02.150" style="s2">or less off off kilter in terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.500" end="01:44:04.400" style="s2">they choose to govern this nation</p>

<p begin="01:44:20.940" end="01:44:26.040" style="s2">have a shiny head of hair to a unique</p>

<p begin="01:44:37.770" end="01:44:45.270" style="s2">necessary thing I think you know for us</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.710" end="01:44:48.120" style="s2">to draw people&#39;s attention away from you</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.270" end="01:44:52.110" style="s2">know the-the-the figures who arise as</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.120" end="01:44:54.300" style="s2">kind of the caricatures of you know who</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.110" end="01:44:58.020" style="s2">the enemy is on the other side or who</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.300" end="01:45:00.179" style="s2">your champion is right and to return it</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.020" end="01:45:01.679" style="s2">squarely to focus on the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.179" end="01:45:03.480" style="s2">really this isn&#39;t a question of you and</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.679" end="01:45:05.880" style="s2">Donald Trump this is a question of you</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.480" end="01:45:07.620" style="s2">and your neighbor you know I see them</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.880" end="01:45:09.239" style="s2">like that right this is the question of</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.620" end="01:45:10.679" style="s2">you and your neighbor right and to see</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.239" end="01:45:15.870" style="s2">the connection between one and the other</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.679" end="01:45:19.080" style="s2">yeah I I love this framing I have</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.870" end="01:45:22.440" style="s2">complex feelings about the president I</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.080" end="01:45:24.060" style="s2">feel we are imperiled I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.440" end="01:45:29.159" style="s2">feel like he&#39;s up to the challenge of</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.060" end="01:45:31.409" style="s2">the office on the other hand all right</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.159" end="01:45:34.020" style="s2">let me try reaching across the aisle on</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.409" end="01:45:36.360" style="s2">this one Donald Trump accomplished</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.020" end="01:45:39.540" style="s2">something that nobody else in recent</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.360" end="01:45:44.340" style="s2">memory has done that he broke through</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.540" end="01:45:47.909" style="s2">the duopoly and that required somebody</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.340" end="01:45:50.400" style="s2">of a particularly unusual Constitution</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.909" end="01:45:52.110" style="s2">and we are now left with such a person</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.400" end="01:45:55.739" style="s2">in office which has been an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.110" end="01:45:57.510" style="s2">experience to be sure but to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.739" end="01:45:59.969" style="s2">that we were suffering from the duopoly</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.510" end="01:46:04.290" style="s2">and something broke through it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.969" end="01:46:08.100" style="s2">Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders was my guy</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.290" end="01:46:11.219" style="s2">in this fight but he couldn&#39;t do it and</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.100" end="01:46:13.110" style="s2">in the end he folded to Clinton which I</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.219" end="01:46:16.070" style="s2">must say still leaves a bitter taste in</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.110" end="01:46:19.590" style="s2">my mouth I think he should have stayed</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.070" end="01:46:21.480" style="s2">true to the fight but Trump did manage</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.590" end="01:46:24.660" style="s2">to break through the duopoly which tells</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.480" end="01:46:27.270" style="s2">in fact that it is possible and that is</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.660" end="01:46:28.890" style="s2">an important if he&#39;s done nothing else</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.270" end="01:46:30.480" style="s2">he has done that service for us as he</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.890" end="01:46:32.730" style="s2">has demonstrated that the story that</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.480" end="01:46:35.370" style="s2">could not be disrupted by anything was</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.730" end="01:46:36.630" style="s2">in fact open to be challenged by</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.370" end="01:46:41.090" style="s2">somebody who was sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.630" end="01:46:44.310" style="s2">politically savvy which I think he is I</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.090" end="01:46:46.380" style="s2">wanted to add one other thing goes back</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.310" end="01:46:51.480" style="s2">to a point you made early in this</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.380" end="01:46:55.470" style="s2">conversation about it was about the</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.480" end="01:46:57.330" style="s2">content that is not analytical involved</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.470" end="01:47:00.210" style="s2">in the discussions across certain</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.330" end="01:47:01.470" style="s2">divides right and I&#39;ve noticed the same</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.210" end="01:47:04.020" style="s2">thing and in fact it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.470" end="01:47:06.630" style="s2">conversation between Heather and me for</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.020" end="01:47:10.020" style="s2">many many years in fact at least since</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.630" end="01:47:11.910" style="s2">we Heather did her field work for a</p>

<p begin="01:47:16.200" end="01:47:21.030" style="s2">is the smart one yes but she is my</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.770" end="01:47:25.260" style="s2">better half I don&#39;t know where we get</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.030" end="01:47:27.870" style="s2">that fraction but anyway she she was</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.260" end="01:47:30.120" style="s2">working in Madagascar and we had the</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.870" end="01:47:31.860" style="s2">pleasure of traveling at a pleasure and</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.120" end="01:47:35.850" style="s2">frustrations very frustrating country</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.860" end="01:47:38.760" style="s2">that traveling but one thing that allows</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.090" end="01:47:49.890" style="s2">that&#39;s true in Madagascar is that when</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.890" end="01:47:52.860" style="s2">people meet they very typically say in</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.890" end="01:47:54.800" style="s2">Volvo which means basically what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.860" end="01:47:56.340" style="s2">news and the response is Shmi fool</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.800" end="01:47:58.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no news</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.340" end="01:48:00.750" style="s2">um and it&#39;s just like hey what&#39;s up not</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.980" end="01:48:02.400" style="s2">much right it&#39;s not a big deal it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.750" end="01:48:04.110" style="s2">fact not different from our culture but</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.400" end="01:48:06.960" style="s2">because you&#39;re learning this language</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.110" end="01:48:09.030" style="s2">that&#39;s so very foreign you hear people</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.960" end="01:48:12.000" style="s2">saying what&#39;s the news there is no news</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.030" end="01:48:15.600" style="s2">and it strikes you this is such an odd</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.000" end="01:48:19.040" style="s2">tradition right but over time thinking</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.600" end="01:48:23.000" style="s2">about it there is some value to</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.040" end="01:48:26.010" style="s2">exchanging absolutely meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.000" end="01:48:28.380" style="s2">systemic readings with each other and in</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.010" end="01:48:30.360" style="s2">my opinion what the value of that is is</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.380" end="01:48:32.870" style="s2">that it actually because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.360" end="01:48:34.800" style="s2">content in it it allows you to evaluate</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.870" end="01:48:36.930" style="s2">the state of the per</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.800" end="01:48:38.460" style="s2">on the other side and so for example if</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.930" end="01:48:42.330" style="s2">you were to meet a close friend somebody</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.460" end="01:48:46.500" style="s2">you knew well and you said what&#39;s up and</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.330" end="01:48:48.420" style="s2">they said not much very likely you could</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.500" end="01:48:51.170" style="s2">detect if they were preoccupied with</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.420" end="01:48:53.670" style="s2">something very serious if they were in a</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.170" end="01:48:55.830" style="s2">frivolous mood you could detect that</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.670" end="01:48:59.030" style="s2">because the content is always the same</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.830" end="01:49:02.460" style="s2">which makes it impossible to hide the</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.030" end="01:49:04.400" style="s2">emotional background and so anyway my</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.460" end="01:49:07.320" style="s2">point here is that I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.400" end="01:49:09.660" style="s2">evolutionarily people have traditions</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.320" end="01:49:14.400" style="s2">that allow those with whom you have</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.660" end="01:49:16.830" style="s2">established trust to read your mental</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.400" end="01:49:18.480" style="s2">state so that they can be more empathic</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.830" end="01:49:20.520" style="s2">so that they can you know if you hear a</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.480" end="01:49:22.080" style="s2">friend say yeah not much is up but you</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.520" end="01:49:24.390" style="s2">can detect that something is that bees</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.080" end="01:49:28.470" style="s2">act come on but what&#39;s really up right</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.390" end="01:49:30.900" style="s2">yeah so my point in the context of your</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.470" end="01:49:36.420" style="s2">project is that it might be very</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.900" end="01:49:37.440" style="s2">valuable to find some exercise that</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.420" end="01:49:40.410" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t have any political</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.440" end="01:49:44.310" style="s2">content whatsoever but allows people to</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.410" end="01:49:48.390" style="s2">sort of establish enough human basics</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.310" end="01:49:52.020" style="s2">that you know I mean I I mentioned this</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.390" end="01:49:54.620" style="s2">to Chloe Valerie I just saw well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.020" end="01:49:58.620" style="s2">something about the way people online</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.620" end="01:50:01.110" style="s2">interact over pets mmm be it cats or</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.620" end="01:50:03.120" style="s2">dogs there&#39;s so unifying thing on the</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.110" end="01:50:05.100" style="s2">Internet completely our love of kittens</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.120" end="01:50:08.430" style="s2">and puppies right I mean the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.100" end="01:50:11.460" style="s2">somebody you know it it almost doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.430" end="01:50:14.280" style="s2">matter what divides you when you watch</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.460" end="01:50:17.850" style="s2">some dog do some particularly impressive</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.280" end="01:50:19.770" style="s2">or noble thing you have a natural human</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.850" end="01:50:21.300" style="s2">reaction that doesn&#39;t depend on what</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.770" end="01:50:22.950" style="s2">culture you come from or what your</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.300" end="01:50:27.540" style="s2">political biases are any of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.950" end="01:50:31.170" style="s2">so I wonder if there&#39;s not if there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.540" end="01:50:34.140" style="s2">not some work to be done establishing a</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.170" end="01:50:37.440" style="s2">set of traditions for the heterodox mmm</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.140" end="01:50:39.990" style="s2">population that just simply I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.440" end="01:50:41.610" style="s2">know I go to these parties and</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.990" end="01:50:44.160" style="s2">gatherings where these people have</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.610" end="01:50:46.200" style="s2">accumulated in some number and there is</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.160" end="01:50:46.929" style="s2">sort of a tenor to the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.200" end="01:50:50.499" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.929" end="01:50:52.510" style="s2">like we are not paying attention to oh</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.499" end="01:50:55.349" style="s2">that&#39;s Robbie George he&#39;s a Republican</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.510" end="01:50:58.119" style="s2">right nobody is thinking that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.349" end="01:51:00.090" style="s2">evaluating each other on individual</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.119" end="01:51:02.619" style="s2">merits there are tensions there are</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.090" end="01:51:04.599" style="s2">affinities all these things exist but</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.619" end="01:51:06.849" style="s2">there is sort of a sense of like geez at</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.599" end="01:51:09.699" style="s2">least that other thing isn&#39;t at this</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.849" end="01:51:11.739" style="s2">party right at least nobody here is you</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.699" end="01:51:13.630" style="s2">know wagging their finger at somebody</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.739" end="01:51:15.969" style="s2">else because of who they voted for in</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.630" end="01:51:18.999" style="s2">the last election yeah yeah well you</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.969" end="01:51:21.010" style="s2">know we&#39;ve had an annual convention for</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.999" end="01:51:22.630" style="s2">better angels national convention two</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.010" end="01:51:26.699" style="s2">years in a row now better angels by the</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.630" end="01:51:29.019" style="s2">way uh sort of got its start in 2016</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.699" end="01:51:30.459" style="s2">immediately following the presidential</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.019" end="01:51:32.199" style="s2">election that&#39;s when we had our first</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.459" end="01:51:34.719" style="s2">workshop but it didn&#39;t really mature as</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.199" end="01:51:39.070" style="s2">an organization until it&#39;s all into the</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.719" end="01:51:41.380" style="s2">spring or so of 2017 I believe and we</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.070" end="01:51:43.420" style="s2">had our first annual convention 2018 and</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.380" end="01:51:45.550" style="s2">then again st. Louis this year where we</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.420" end="01:51:48.459" style="s2">had among others</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.550" end="01:51:50.170" style="s2">Tea Party leader ray wor from Cincinnati</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.459" end="01:51:52.780" style="s2">and Hawk Newsom of black lives matter</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.170" end="01:51:55.119" style="s2">engaged in a conversation that went over</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.780" end="01:51:58.239" style="s2">fabulously well with folks in the</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.119" end="01:52:00.789" style="s2">audience but the well the delegates who</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.239" end="01:52:02.679" style="s2">attended so we had 150 delegates or so</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.789" end="01:52:04.510" style="s2">from each side of the aisle red and blue</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.679" end="01:52:05.979" style="s2">come out to Barry come out to the</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.510" end="01:52:07.239" style="s2">convention not just to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.979" end="01:52:10.659" style="s2">conversations but to actively</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.239" end="01:52:15.099" style="s2">participate in our workshop programs and</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.659" end="01:52:18.099" style="s2">to deliberate on the content of better</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.099" end="01:52:20.170" style="s2">angels 2019 platform which members of</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.099" end="01:52:22.659" style="s2">your audience kin can read at our</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.170" end="01:52:25.209" style="s2">website when we outlined the mission and</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.659" end="01:52:28.479" style="s2">the goals of the organization in over</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.209" end="01:52:31.329" style="s2">the course of over the course of 2019</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.479" end="01:52:34.380" style="s2">and details some of the various</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.329" end="01:52:37.239" style="s2">initiatives that we would be pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.380" end="01:52:39.130" style="s2">that document was a product of a</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.239" end="01:52:41.709" style="s2">deliberative interaction between folks</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.130" end="01:52:45.369" style="s2">on both sides now you know you could say</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.709" end="01:52:46.719" style="s2">that this is this is political but it</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.369" end="01:52:49.179" style="s2">didn&#39;t really deal with political issues</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.719" end="01:52:51.249" style="s2">exactly dealt with our attempt to shift</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.179" end="01:52:53.889" style="s2">the culture the participation in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.249" end="01:52:56.110" style="s2">programs gives people the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.889" end="01:52:58.659" style="s2">dig into sort of personal subject matter</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.110" end="01:53:00.400" style="s2">and so forth to establish these bonds of</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.659" end="01:53:02.020" style="s2">connection but what</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.400" end="01:53:03.159" style="s2">was most powerful really and</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.020" end="01:53:05.350" style="s2">particularly as I listened to you speak</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.159" end="01:53:06.730" style="s2">is for me to think about all of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.350" end="01:53:09.750" style="s2">things that happened in the space</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.730" end="01:53:13.420" style="s2">between those exercises and those events</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.750" end="01:53:16.120" style="s2">because are coalescing around the work</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.420" end="01:53:17.920" style="s2">of bringing Americans together resulted</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.120" end="01:53:22.719" style="s2">in the small talk of bringing Americans</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.920" end="01:53:25.300" style="s2">together right and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.719" end="01:53:28.270" style="s2">process of seeing a social language</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.300" end="01:53:31.120" style="s2">begin to kind of develop between groups</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.270" end="01:53:34.690" style="s2">of people who did not share one before</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.120" end="01:53:37.239" style="s2">and in coming together across the the</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.690" end="01:53:39.010" style="s2">Gulf in these perspectives are sort of</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.239" end="01:53:40.989" style="s2">in the process of inventing it or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.010" end="01:53:42.460" style="s2">in some cases rediscovering it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.989" end="01:53:43.989" style="s2">hard to know whether it&#39;s more of one</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.460" end="01:53:48.010" style="s2">than the other</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.989" end="01:53:52.510" style="s2">but there is a process of generating</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.010" end="01:53:56.290" style="s2">sort of the social language that ties us</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.510" end="01:53:57.969" style="s2">together that is reflected in just sort</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.290" end="01:54:03.610" style="s2">of the way we say hello or how&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.969" end="01:54:05.140" style="s2">going you know or and that seems like</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.610" end="01:54:07.060" style="s2">the least important part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.140" end="01:54:09.219" style="s2">doing might actually be the most</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.060" end="01:54:12.550" style="s2">important part because as that starts to</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.219" end="01:54:14.040" style="s2">congeal you see the the windows by which</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.550" end="01:54:17.739" style="s2">we were able to develop an intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.040" end="01:54:19.989" style="s2">appreciation for who we are and a level</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.739" end="01:54:22.900" style="s2">of connection that allows us to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.989" end="01:54:25.300" style="s2">begin to feel comfortable just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.900" end="01:54:27.460" style="s2">taking it for granted that the person</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.300" end="01:54:31.000" style="s2">with whom I&#39;m speaking is somebody who I</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.460" end="01:54:33.219" style="s2">share some level of humanity with and</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.000" end="01:54:34.989" style="s2">some level of common interest that is</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.219" end="01:54:37.449" style="s2">not just technical or material but</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.989" end="01:54:37.810" style="s2">earnestly felt from one person to the</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.449" end="01:54:40.570" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.810" end="01:54:41.770" style="s2">and so differences can arise on top of</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.570" end="01:54:44.620" style="s2">that rapport but if you have that</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.770" end="01:54:46.929" style="s2">rapport underlying it there becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.620" end="01:54:48.790" style="s2">space for grace if you will to</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.929" end="01:54:50.830" style="s2">accommodate you know the tensions of</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.790" end="01:54:54.449" style="s2">disagreement that might arise and a</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.830" end="01:54:58.449" style="s2">further conversation and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.449" end="01:55:01.199" style="s2">restoring just sort of our our intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.449" end="01:55:05.679" style="s2">social appreciation of one another is</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.199" end="01:55:07.630" style="s2">every bit as much of a vital outcome of</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.679" end="01:55:09.790" style="s2">the consolidation of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.630" end="01:55:11.469" style="s2">movement as is anything else because</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.790" end="01:55:13.739" style="s2">again it&#39;s it&#39;s the little things that</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.469" end="01:55:16.500" style="s2">sustain us and social interaction</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.739" end="01:55:20.489" style="s2">and those are the easiest things to</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.500" end="01:55:22.370" style="s2">forget and I think also I&#39;m not 100%</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.489" end="01:55:25.620" style="s2">sure I believe this but I think I do</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.370" end="01:55:28.350" style="s2">once you have seen somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.620" end="01:55:31.739" style="s2">humanity once an individual you know a</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.350" end="01:55:33.570" style="s2">person can fake it kind of a camera but</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.739" end="01:55:35.460" style="s2">if you&#39;ve spoken with somebody and you</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.570" end="01:55:37.350" style="s2">felt their humanity it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.460" end="01:55:39.750" style="s2">unlearn that lesson they might behave</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.350" end="01:55:42.090" style="s2">badly they might disappoint you but you</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.750" end="01:55:44.370" style="s2">don&#39;t forget that they&#39;re a person right</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.090" end="01:55:46.320" style="s2">so in some sense establishing those</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.370" end="01:55:50.820" style="s2">bonds may be very durable once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.320" end="01:55:52.080" style="s2">there and very very important well John</p>

<p begin="01:57:17.700" end="01:57:23.040" style="s2">am launching - John Wood jr. show where</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.890" end="01:57:26.280" style="s2">I will be leaning in to basically the</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.040" end="01:57:27.070" style="s2">this this project of articulating a</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.280" end="01:57:29.530" style="s2">narrative of</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.070" end="01:57:33.760" style="s2">we are as Americans that can evolve over</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.530" end="01:57:36.400" style="s2">time right and so my my intention on the</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.760" end="01:57:38.890" style="s2">John Wood jr. show is to speak to this</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.400" end="01:57:40.960" style="s2">budding movement in the center of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.890" end="01:57:43.090" style="s2">American consciousness if you will and</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.960" end="01:57:45.520" style="s2">to tell a story about who we are that</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.090" end="01:57:47.020" style="s2">leans a little bit into Who I am because</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.520" end="01:57:49.210" style="s2">I do come from a biracial and a</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.020" end="01:57:52.150" style="s2">multicultural and bipartisan sort of</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.210" end="01:57:54.340" style="s2">family background and I&#39;ve grown up</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.150" end="01:57:56.260" style="s2">seeing people cross these divides</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.340" end="01:57:57.880" style="s2">sometimes in ways that don&#39;t work but</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.260" end="01:58:00.460" style="s2">frequently in ways that do and that</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.880" end="01:58:02.500" style="s2">endure you know I&#39;m sort of a product of</p>
