<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">the core practice which is philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">contemplative uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">companionships this is a way of</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">these three things linked together</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">sense of the text because the practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">centers on a text</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">making sense of the text all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">others the other people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">entering into fellowship with</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">and making sense with others</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">because all sense making is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">done with and through</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">other people these</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">are all interconnected remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">contemplate hillary what&#39;s our basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">attitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:22.159" style="s2">we are trying to travel far away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">the familiar</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.159" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">automatic our opinion our normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">self and see something that we have not</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">seen before</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">seen something we have not seen before</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s zero in first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">network today we&#39;re moving more towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">the practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">so some practice principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">okay so making sense of the text</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">so what are what&#39;s the main couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">main principles here</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">so thinking through the text</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">be by means of it and beyond it like</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">seeing through my glasses contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">thinking through the text not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">thinking about the text</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">or thinking at the text and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">doing is relating not only to the what</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">of the text the content of the text but</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">the how</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">of the text what do you mean about</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">relating to the how what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">primarily doing here when you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">sense of the text is you are trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">to adopt the perspective of the text</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">or more more personally the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">of the author of the text so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s plato</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to adopt plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">so think about doing this adverbially</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to do is to see let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">the text is from plato i&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">through the text so i can see myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">other people the others in the group and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">the world the situation when i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">see it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">platonically adverbially i don&#39;t i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">so much what i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">i want to i it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s serious play i want to play as</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">as i&#39;m reading the text listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually me thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">those words as if i&#39;m plato thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">those words</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">for the first time and what do i see</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">this is somewhat like lectio right how</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">do i see myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">and others and the world through this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">so what i&#39;m very much trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">right is i&#39;m trying to engage in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">and visioning i want to see things</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">through the text the way the author of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">the text</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">saw them as they were thinking those</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal you&#39;re here which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">very different from our normal goal</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">right our normal goal is to get to</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">and deepening that process</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">of really enacted understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">of the text so that&#39;s the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do here</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">when we are trying to speak</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">in reference to the text what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">invoke we&#39;re trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">to the text speak from</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">the emerging presence</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">of the author of the text so as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">see the text platonically you start to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">right of what it&#39;d be like to be plato</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">speak from that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">give voice to that you are and think</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">you&#39;re entering into a chorus a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">people it&#39;s like there&#39;s been a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">music created called plato</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re all singing it and the text</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">are the notes</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re using to sing plato into</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">it&#39;s very magical in the ritual sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">the word magic</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the basic principle we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">envision and invoke envision and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">invoke we&#39;re trying to see through the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">adverbially</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">you might be asking where are we going</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">to get taxed and how big should it be</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">hang off on those practical questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll answer those but let&#39;s get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">principles first</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">okay making sense of others so i won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">write that down you&#39;re just making sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">of others</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">what do we want to do here okay so here</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">the main thing is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">internalize other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">and you say what that means take their</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">but also let their words reverberate</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">and this is a good reverb reverberate</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">within you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">try to create from mindfulness an inner</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">space of silence</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">away from that part of you that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">judge give opinions</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">react that states and let the words</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">reverberate in you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like alexia listening you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">want to let the words of other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">reverberate in you as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">you want to see what their words</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">in conjunction with the text is like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">triangle here&#39;s their words</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">here&#39;s the words of the text and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">they sort of triangulate in on you and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">they call something forth from you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">then they write the there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">so you&#39;re invoking plato but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">evoking</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">from you okay evocation</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">so you&#39;re trying to have an evocative</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">response and you&#39;re triangulating</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">the words of the text and the words of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">let create a space it reverberate inside</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">so that something is evoked in you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">but what we&#39;re seeking here is to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">something to emerge from your depths</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">other than from the familiar center</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">of right your speaking mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">fioria so</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">evocation so we had</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">right first two we are envisioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">an invocation now we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">internalization and evocation</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:47.839" style="s2">okay so again envisioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re making sense of the text and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">you&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">trying to right invoke the person i</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">invoke the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:57.920" style="s2">presence of plato sounds almost magical</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.920" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">and here right when we are making sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">of others</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">what we want to do is internalize them</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">by reverberating</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">and then evoking what&#39;s evoked from us</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">by from the words of the text and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">we create a silent space we reverberate</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">until something is evoked</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">from us so you&#39;re going to be speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">at a much slower pace</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">than you normally do</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">okay making sense with others making</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">sense with others</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">okay so the thing to what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">think about here is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">the idea of coupled emergence</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to couple with</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">the text and with others but especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">with the others</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.120" style="s2">so that they&#39;re what&#39;s emerging from</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">them and what&#39;s emerging from you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.120" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging from the text</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">are all coordinated coupled together</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">so here what we&#39;re trying to do is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">metaphor that&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">consistently by the have and a reminder</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">that we&#39;re making use of this book</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">as well as a bunch of other books by</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">lahav</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">all right is resonate resonate</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">all these musical metaphors of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">and here what you&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">you are speaking and you&#39;re making sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">with others</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">this is incorporate incorporating</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">this literally means that we now think</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">of it as corporations</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">but originally goes back to the body of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">christ</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:41.279" style="s2">this is sharing one body we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">co-embody</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.279" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">together so you speak and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">to incorporate what other people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">said and what the text has said</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">so this is the opposite of what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">normally want to do normally we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">distinguish ourselves look at me</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">and we want to distinguish ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">right from the text</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">and what people others have said this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">the opposite we&#39;re trying to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">the text and what others have said and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">another metaphor that&#39;s used all right</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">we&#39;ll have and many other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">is jazz right you&#39;re trying to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">on what other people have said</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">incorporate it into what you say add on</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">vary it like in jazz where somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">plays something</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">i pick up on it and then i play with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">and vary it and then pass it on to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">who picks up on picks up on it plays</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">and passes it on so the main metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">you&#39;re doing here is we&#39;re trying as i</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">mentioned last time</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to create a chorus of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">voices all of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">each one of us is trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">voice to plato or to spinoza or to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re creating a chorus of voices</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">all right now what does that mean what</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">are some things we shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">well here&#39;s what we shouldn&#39;t do don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">agree or disagree with the text if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">start agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">saying i agree or disagree you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">doing this practice</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">okay don&#39;t evaluate it this is good this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">is bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">okay three things to avoid you want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">avoid automaticity just</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">what does automaticity mean just</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">automatically i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">you know quickly um acting</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">out of habit acting a lot of what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">acting out of speaking out of our normal</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">opinions so</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">we want to avoid automaticity we want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">autobiography avoid autobiography don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">give your anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">don&#39;t relate this to your personal story</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">autobiography and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">avoid authority don&#39;t speak as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">authority on anything</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">because the author who is present is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">you not the other person it&#39;s the author</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">of the text</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">who is being presented present</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">presented and presented okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">so i want you to think of 3d</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">co-emergence what i mean by 3d</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get the depth of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">text</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">the depth of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">and the depth of others</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get these to all</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">mutually afford each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">3d co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">if you get lahav not all of this is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">la have this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">me uh putting it together integrated</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">with epicureanness of integrating with</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">some cockside mnemonics</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">and ideas and also integrating it uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">with other practices i&#39;ve done that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">similar to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">but so the 3d co-emergence that but this</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">is still this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">what this is going to the core of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">what i would argue bahave is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:10.800" style="s2">get us to see he uses these words</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t quite schematize it this way</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.800" end="00:15:14.639" style="s2">but i think this is very</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">very consonant with his text depth of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.639" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">the text depth of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">depth of others</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">okay so now the setup</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">how do we set this practice up</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">so you have a four by four he recommends</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">four to six all the work i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">all the participants</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">this seems to be the golden number you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">want four people who to agree to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">agree to me at least a minimum of four</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">four people who agreed to meet and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">is going to be very much online</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">four times what you&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">you&#39;re going to rotate the facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">each time it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">different facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">what does the facilitator do okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">facilitator goes to agora this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s uh www</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">dot filo practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">this is where at least start and then of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">course with time there are other sources</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">dot org and there you will find a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">two paragraph readings philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">readings that have been chosen</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:40.639" style="s2">to be specifically used in this practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">when you when everybody meets the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.639" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">facilitator will organize the order when</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">you&#39;re meeting in person you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">spatially when you&#39;re meeting online</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">a good idea is to order people</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">alphabetically</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">and everybody remember who comes before</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">them and who comes after them</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">all right so organize the order</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">and the facilitator is going to lead</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">people through</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">the the sequence of uh of the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">the sequence of practices</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">okay so one of the things the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">thing the facilitator does is when</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">people meet</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">of course people are welcomed they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">greeted but the facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">basically tries to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">reduce or prevent socializing do not</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">by socializing socialization comes after</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">people should greet each other but then</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">we should move immediately into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">practice that&#39;s actually highly</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.840" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">in a couple places like because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">people get in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">they get into this other mode and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">it actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">thwarts them getting into the the mode</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get into with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">so plan to meet 60 to 90 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.360" style="s2">okay so the sequences as i said</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">obviously the facilitator welcomes</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">everybody comes in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">greets everybody right</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">and then what you want to do is you want</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">he he has a very much vague notion he</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">says do centering practices</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">i recommend setting up the core four of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:18.880" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">find your centered all of you together</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">take some time</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">10 minutes or so find your center find</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:29.360" style="s2">your route find your flow find your</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.360" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">okay then you&#39;re going to do the main</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">which i will describe shortly</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">and then everybody does</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s a four everybody does a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">what did they get from this and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2">if people want you can go into</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">socializing</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the basic sequence</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s talk about some basic</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">procedures these are</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">uh these are uh practices that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">going to engage in regularly and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">reliably that cultivate the skills</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">that you are going to be putting into</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:28.960" style="s2">as you do the main exercise okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.960" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">is slow reading</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">so the name is quite um explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">whenever the text is being read it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">usually as we&#39;ll see it&#39;s initially read</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">by the facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">the facilitator reads it slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">reads it in a lectio divina fashion</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">reads it in the sense of reciting it</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">the reader should pause periodically</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">throughout to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">give people a time to a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">and and also a chance to start to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">reverberate with it like in lexia</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">and so as i said here what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">to do here is this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:13.840" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to afford the reading is</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">trying to afford people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.840" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">internalizing the text</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">starting to be able to envision it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">right starting to be starting to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">preparing to invoke it</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">so that&#39;s the intent the slow reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">really this is take this seriously</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">this is also a way of bringing a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">reverential attitude in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">reverence doesn&#39;t mean i agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">or everything is true</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">reverence is this ha this is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">of being profound</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">okay so the next is precious speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">these are the halves names precious</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">okay so what are what so when you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk first about the form of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">your speech</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">you want condensed and focused speech</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">what&#39;s the principle i want to say as</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">with as few words as possible i want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">say as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">with as few words as possible and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">won&#39;t utter more than one</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">or maybe two sentences at most</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the manner</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">the manner especially goes into that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">point about resonating that resonance</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">and here&#39;s where the previous epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">practices come in</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">speak and as you&#39;re speaking</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">associations and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">you&#39;re also seeking various connections</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">between all those associations</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:07.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not speaking that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s slow reading and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:05.840" style="s2">precious speaking</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">third kind of procedure intentional</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">okay there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">so when you&#39;re listening as i said</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">listen from the desk</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">try to create a space of silence within</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">letting things reverberate</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">savor what other people are saying</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">savor it savor the text this is why</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve practiced savoring so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">you are i like uh rusin&#39;s title of his</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">to others you&#39;re bearing witness to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">like you are at a birth of a child</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">bearing witness to it remember that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the original meaning of conceive</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">your concepts but now we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">give birth</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">we&#39;re bearing witness we&#39;re giving birth</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">to plato or spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">or augustine and we&#39;re also giving birth</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.600" style="s2">in coordination with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">so as i said when you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">you speak from the depths</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">what it basically is here is extended</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">precious speaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">so you do the listening i just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">so here now you&#39;re going to speak maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:56.400" style="s2">or five sentences max with</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">same form same manner</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.400" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">right so you do this very savoring</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.440" end="00:26:02.559" style="s2">like alexio davina listening and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.559" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">when it&#39;s your turn to speak and people</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">are taking turns</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">speaking the facilitator makes sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">that people speak in turn according to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">the order that was assigned</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">so as i said you&#39;re trying to speak so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">and what the project is here is together</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">cooperative coupled fashion we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">to co-presence</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.760" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">in an adverbial fashion the author of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">the text the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">view of the text the way of seeing</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">and that is calling from us and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">calling to each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">3d coupled co-emergence</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">okay so now what&#39;s the main exercise oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">sorry one more</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">one more sorry one more procedure</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">ruminatio</p>
