<p begin="00:00:00.500" end="00:00:08.670" style="s2">hello everybody thanks for tuning in</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.090" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">again in case you didn&#39;t listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.670" end="00:00:17.250" style="s2">first video of my conversation with with</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:20.630" style="s2">you Woodson you has got a ton of degrees</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.250" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">and he&#39;s written a ton of poetry books</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.630" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">books on theology and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">he&#39;s quite prolific and I really got the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">sense in talking with him</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">and I&#39;m and I met him after reading one</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:40.309" style="s2">of his books his uh his high daguerreian</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:40.309" style="s2">theological I would say investigations</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.920" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">in reaching I reached out to him after I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.230" end="00:00:49.059" style="s2">read the book because I was quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:51.850" style="s2">impressed with his thoughts and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.059" end="00:00:55.570" style="s2">unique view that he had on things and to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.850" end="00:00:57.969" style="s2">me spoke very directly to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.570" end="00:01:00.460" style="s2">the meaning crisis and in our particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.969" end="00:01:02.619" style="s2">time so I reached out to him it knees</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">bent and he&#39;s so friendly and so open to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.619" end="00:01:07.240" style="s2">talking and I really I really got the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:10.689" style="s2">sense of the source from which he writes</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.240" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">write is really not one of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.689" end="00:01:18.310" style="s2">figure something out or or find out any</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:20.200" style="s2">kind of final final conclusion around</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.310" end="00:01:23.560" style="s2">anything will defend anything but rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.200" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">like he&#39;s really an artist and you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.560" end="00:01:28.420" style="s2">really feel that in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:31.060" style="s2">the first video was a lot about getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.420" end="00:01:34.539" style="s2">to just to know him and his you know his</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.060" end="00:01:35.709" style="s2">views and where you know why he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.539" end="00:01:38.289" style="s2">interested in the things of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.709" end="00:01:40.209" style="s2">instrument and then he had some</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.289" end="00:01:43.330" style="s2">technical difficulties and the video cut</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.209" end="00:01:45.250" style="s2">off and then he came back on and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.330" end="00:01:48.070" style="s2">forgot to press the record button for</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.250" end="00:01:49.990" style="s2">about the first 10 minutes so this video</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.070" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">picks up from the point where I pressed</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.990" end="00:02:02.679" style="s2">record button my adventures in becoming</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:04.899" style="s2">a host I guess some kind so just so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.679" end="00:02:07.719" style="s2">know this one this is that first 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.899" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">minutes is is we were for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.719" end="00:02:15.190" style="s2">just really kind of getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:18.790" style="s2">process of thought itself and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.190" end="00:02:22.350" style="s2">thinking is right in the deeper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.790" end="00:02:28.049" style="s2">the word and especially him being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.350" end="00:02:28.049" style="s2">Haida garyun scholar and a theologian</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.130" end="00:02:33.590" style="s2">what the movement of thoughts and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:37.070" style="s2">way that Heidegger knew opened up in his</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.590" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">work what that&#39;s done to him and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.070" end="00:02:41.390" style="s2">that&#39;s done historically and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:44.110" style="s2">differently allowed like different</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.390" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">theologians have have taken that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.110" end="00:02:50.660" style="s2">integrated that into their theologies</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:52.310" style="s2">and what became possible with that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.660" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">this is where we start to get a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.310" end="00:02:58.340" style="s2">bit more into dialogue oh swear I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:03:00.290" style="s2">definitely was lightbulbs were going off</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.340" end="00:03:02.030" style="s2">for me and I think for him too in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.290" end="00:03:03.710" style="s2">conversation and I think it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.030" end="00:03:05.320" style="s2">beginning and I&#39;m really glad that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.710" end="00:03:07.520" style="s2">part of the conversation the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.320" end="00:03:11.090" style="s2">really enjoyed him and I&#39;ll be joined</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.520" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">his spirit a lot so uh thanks for tuning</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.090" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">in and enjoy the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:24.800" style="s2">moving beyond that these are terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.060" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">constantly circling back circling back</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.800" end="00:03:28.940" style="s2">trying to figure out a better way to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:31.400" style="s2">this word better we articulated so then</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.940" end="00:03:34.100" style="s2">as he begins that book by going at</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.400" end="00:03:36.710" style="s2">Plato&#39;s and the sophist by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.100" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">we for God would be his and the opening</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.710" end="00:03:41.480" style="s2">part of that book he eventually starts</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">going back to pre-socratic so looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:46.070" style="s2">Heraclitus and Parmenides and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:49.960" style="s2">and saying wait a minute so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.070" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">listening to this that is always always</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.960" end="00:03:55.190" style="s2">already a part of what I&#39;m doing yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">after to myself to that because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.190" end="00:04:01.100" style="s2">the only way I can know logos yes I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:04.210" style="s2">could Alethea is by allowing myself to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.100" end="00:04:06.860" style="s2">catch up with a late year realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.210" end="00:04:08.990" style="s2">tradition metaphysics humanism are</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.860" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">things that are pulling me away from it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.990" end="00:04:13.700" style="s2">even though the idea was that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:16.610" style="s2">things were meant to make being human</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.700" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">easier over time yeah but it became</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.610" end="00:04:22.610" style="s2">easier but it also had hollowed out to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:24.290" style="s2">you yes everything is to human right the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.610" end="00:04:26.480" style="s2">service thing so did you want to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.290" end="00:04:28.640" style="s2">of that and figure out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.480" end="00:04:31.910" style="s2">keep things out like it was so empty</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.640" end="00:04:35.240" style="s2">display or something yeah so and so then</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.910" end="00:04:37.220" style="s2">you can be primed and attune to these</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.240" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">logos and be able to see things and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.220" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">truer you know sort of a concealed</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">fashion because could they write a good</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">you know the world is full of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.340" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">concealment</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">yeah language itself is a consumer so</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">then you have to figure out how can I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:52.820" style="s2">say things or get to things in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.820" end="00:04:58.520" style="s2">reduces what naturally wants to conceal</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:05:01.460" style="s2">itself yeah so they can be on conceal</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.520" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">and be ready for me to grasp with and be</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:05.150" style="s2">able to understand in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">phenomenological way like right moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.150" end="00:05:09.470" style="s2">into my ruling the my like you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2">the ideal the foreground I&#39;m like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.470" end="00:05:12.680" style="s2">foreground for knowledge all those</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.450" end="00:05:15.110" style="s2">things are there you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">how do I get myself position so then I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.110" end="00:05:19.610" style="s2">can really see that in a very in a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:20.600" style="s2">that and this is kind of what he</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.610" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">mentions like we&#39;re here at claims I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.600" end="00:05:24.530" style="s2">here class is already knowing this my</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:26.630" style="s2">great that he requires Parmenides and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:30.169" style="s2">Plato comes in he just turns the table</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.630" end="00:05:31.400" style="s2">over different right it&#39;s not being true</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.169" end="00:05:31.849" style="s2">that someone was really think you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.400" end="00:05:34.459" style="s2">that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.849" end="00:05:37.099" style="s2">goes back to me right yeah that said</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.459" end="00:05:38.689" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s like was it Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.099" end="00:05:42.169" style="s2">I think for cities like back the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.689" end="00:05:44.899" style="s2">philosopher the philosopher doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.169" end="00:05:48.529" style="s2">kind of original orig like out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.899" end="00:05:51.169" style="s2">nothing think anew yeah what he knows it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.529" end="00:05:53.119" style="s2">or not he actually is the one in the in</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.169" end="00:05:54.949" style="s2">the big philosophers little ones then</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.119" end="00:05:59.179" style="s2">because we&#39;re on to--they ology comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.949" end="00:06:02.959" style="s2">from my they&#39;re able to think that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.179" end="00:06:04.819" style="s2">emerging thought that or the emergent or</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.959" end="00:06:08.059" style="s2">movement or change in the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.819" end="00:06:13.159" style="s2">of being and they&#39;re able to like mink</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.059" end="00:06:16.789" style="s2">it decisive right this des prés like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.159" end="00:06:21.080" style="s2">Anto the innermost ring and the oh right</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.789" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">yeah yes yeah yes able to do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.080" end="00:06:25.159" style="s2">that&#39;s tangible they really mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.610" end="00:06:26.689" style="s2">something and this goes to like how</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.159" end="00:06:28.819" style="s2">you&#39;d have certain certain people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.689" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">love what Bart is doing because Bart is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.819" end="00:06:33.649" style="s2">not doing what they want someone to stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:35.240" style="s2">true to you know the scriptures nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.649" end="00:06:38.059" style="s2">the tradition and say screwed to take</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.059" end="00:06:41.689" style="s2">to do at the level they&#39;re doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.039" end="00:06:42.110" style="s2">then you have to look in Baltimore and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.689" end="00:06:43.669" style="s2">Rahner</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.110" end="00:06:46.519" style="s2">they&#39;re saying I can still talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.669" end="00:06:48.459" style="s2">those things those doctrines Christology</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.519" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">and I can talk about soteriology</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:56.749" style="s2">things but then route throws in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.879" end="00:06:59.089" style="s2">that is not ain&#39;t concealed in the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.749" end="00:07:01.369" style="s2">understanding of yeah but he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.089" end="00:07:03.800" style="s2">pull out of the things that what was</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.369" end="00:07:05.029" style="s2">controller yeah what was concealed</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.800" end="00:07:06.259" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re more concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.029" end="00:07:08.419" style="s2">and that that&#39;s why that&#39;s what Roger</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.259" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">ends up getting to a support which made</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:12.889" style="s2">him so huge and because think about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:14.839" style="s2">he&#39;s a Catholic thinker and he&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.889" end="00:07:17.029" style="s2">much probably the only one maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.839" end="00:07:20.029" style="s2">even doing this within that sort of camp</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.029" end="00:07:22.579" style="s2">and that sort of approach is looked as</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.029" end="00:07:24.019" style="s2">being well you have a lane to be you</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.579" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">have to stand at Lane with and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.019" end="00:07:28.069" style="s2">someone that says well I&#39;m gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:31.550" style="s2">a different Lane that includes all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.069" end="00:07:33.559" style="s2">other great it Rogers it&#39;s not inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.550" end="00:07:36.019" style="s2">there&#39;s something that&#39;s exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.559" end="00:07:38.119" style="s2">probably includes both the two things at</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.019" end="00:07:41.149" style="s2">the same time which I think runners</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.119" end="00:07:42.860" style="s2">fascinating is he wrote so many works in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.149" end="00:07:44.419" style="s2">his career of his er if you ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:44.940" style="s2">like is a huge volume of working me he</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.419" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">wrote his</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.940" end="00:07:51.630" style="s2">higher life articles is his major book</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.060" end="00:07:54.270" style="s2">of course that is very highly influenced</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.630" end="00:07:56.760" style="s2">with very kind of postural influence but</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:58.290" style="s2">he wanted to write about every single</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.760" end="00:08:00.480" style="s2">thing you could possibly think of in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.290" end="00:08:04.230" style="s2">terms of biology he pretty much did so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.480" end="00:08:06.780" style="s2">he is unsurpassed in terms of his body</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.230" end="00:08:10.530" style="s2">of work that way and until it of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.780" end="00:08:13.980" style="s2">going to create a real systematic</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.530" end="00:08:15.720" style="s2">theology that is using existence as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.980" end="00:08:18.360" style="s2">centerpiece is almost as if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.720" end="00:08:19.470" style="s2">some sort of doctor yeah anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.360" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">that becomes a thing that ties</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.470" end="00:08:23.820" style="s2">everything together yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">Beaumont of course with language and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.820" end="00:08:28.860" style="s2">tradition and you&#39;ll robot start off</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:30.660" style="s2">trying to figure out about synoptic</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.860" end="00:08:32.190" style="s2">tradition synoptic problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.660" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">gospel but he moves from there said we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.190" end="00:08:35.909" style="s2">made him maybe all these things are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:38.669" style="s2">mythology maybe we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.909" end="00:08:40.340" style="s2">how to take the mythology out of it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.669" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">mythology then becomes something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.340" end="00:08:46.980" style="s2">conceals so that we don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">can never get to what Jesus really means</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.980" end="00:08:52.380" style="s2">yeah outside of that so tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">all these things have to be kind of yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.380" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">they&#39;re stripped down so then everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.470" style="s2">can come up in Oakland steel fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:01.050" style="s2">they they&#39;re doing some things that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.470" end="00:09:02.940" style="s2">carving paths that are raised</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.050" end="00:09:05.490" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t have happened here not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.940" end="00:09:07.770" style="s2">good variety you had a group dinner</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.490" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">piece of that and you know I think some</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.770" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">of them eventually tried to resist that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">over time I think kind of maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">kind of minimizing a certain extent I me</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:19.950" style="s2">to the rights only a couple of instances</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:22.200" style="s2">where he says yeah I he got rid</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.950" end="00:09:24.900" style="s2">Heidegger and I know you really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.200" end="00:09:26.700" style="s2">talk about him a lot right no he does</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.900" end="00:09:29.640" style="s2">well he keeps it to the you know to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.700" end="00:09:31.950" style="s2">way you know even even runners like you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:37.050" style="s2">know yeah those other things there by</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.950" end="00:09:38.670" style="s2">those runners dissertations they do they</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.580" end="00:11:03.790" style="s2">back to his early time his early careers</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">early you know studies in Heidegger and</p>

<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:41.050" style="s2">with Heidegger in theology by way of him</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.950" end="00:11:42.340" style="s2">remembering cuz he often would tell me</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.050" end="00:11:44.860" style="s2">that you know he said you know if you</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.770" end="00:12:11.740" style="s2">was a huge influence but he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.420" end="00:12:14.590" style="s2">missing a whole lot though he keeps</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.740" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">kind of suppressed but I talked with him</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.590" end="00:12:18.070" style="s2">McGowan was a lot about Heidegger that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.740" style="s2">was something that we spent lots of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.070" end="00:12:22.660" style="s2">now we talk every Saturday now when you</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.210" end="00:13:09.280" style="s2">thinking that happens to be articulated</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.090" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">by Heidegger in a way you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.280" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">go to to build what you&#39;re doing so then</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.180" end="00:13:38.020" style="s2">from a school of thought that just is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.420" end="00:13:40.380" style="s2">inseparable from even just a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.760" end="00:16:36.070" style="s2">humanism is that it&#39;s not doing enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.459" end="00:16:38.089" style="s2">to address the issue which I think he</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.870" end="00:17:03.740" style="s2">that is definitely now I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.089" end="00:17:06.020" style="s2">discounts Archer does some great things</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.740" end="00:17:08.839" style="s2">but and I think that&#39;s a good point that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.020" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">I think becomes part of this sort of way</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.839" end="00:17:13.939" style="s2">and that how you realize is when a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:16.039" style="s2">of Sartre students were then going back</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.939" end="00:17:17.929" style="s2">and say well if sorry we start to wrote</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.820" end="00:17:54.919" style="s2">his work even be at a time I think be</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:56.809" style="s2">being at tired yeah he&#39;s big he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.240" end="00:18:02.779" style="s2">before you know the temporality is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.710" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">important great and man doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.779" end="00:18:10.520" style="s2">without time yeah is something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">becomes the the framework that allows me</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.520" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">to be in a lot of ways you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:18.710" style="s2">think he&#39;s the tradition thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:20.390" style="s2">for him was always tricky because when</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">you&#39;re rebelling is tradition it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.390" end="00:18:26.029" style="s2">of like you have to do so in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:27.500" style="s2">is nuanced yeah but then realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.029" end="00:18:29.270" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be able to do what you were</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.290" end="00:19:19.100" style="s2">kind of opens up this foot game right</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:20.990" style="s2">then no one had really thought about</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.100" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">before I think I&#39;m gonna focal : you</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.470" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">there&#39;s something see I think in many</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:11.260" style="s2">where I really get this sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.690" end="00:20:11.260" style="s2">Heidegger and theology right some ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.320" end="00:20:16.910" style="s2">Heidegger never and this is where this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.260" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">is where the sense of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.910" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">Heidegger kind of um broke the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:29.809" style="s2">right but he was but he had his eye on</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:31.820" style="s2">right just over it there was a say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.809" end="00:20:35.750" style="s2">that there were inside of the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.820" end="00:20:40.429" style="s2">was concealed the intelligibility of</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.429" end="00:20:45.740" style="s2">they go they relook at all the symbols</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.160" end="00:20:49.940" style="s2">and then they they draw out right the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.740" end="00:20:52.700" style="s2">the ability that was concealed in the in</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.940" end="00:20:55.490" style="s2">in its nearness of the church and all</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.700" end="00:20:59.750" style="s2">the traditions right in here he figure</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.490" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">Eight&#39;s it and I and I think that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.750" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">of maybe where some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.950" end="00:21:05.530" style="s2">post-modernism like health or tray is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">they just took that they just</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.530" end="00:21:12.679" style="s2">breaking it yeah they didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:14.360" style="s2">sense of the emergence of the new ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.679" end="00:21:16.790" style="s2">of the new annum</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.360" end="00:21:19.549" style="s2">mating because it made sense right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.790" end="00:21:21.500" style="s2">so like and all that is part of a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.549" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">movement but this is the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.500" end="00:21:25.640" style="s2">which is really interesting and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:28.370" style="s2">you probably interested in to this is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.640" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">think that where we may be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.370" end="00:21:40.100" style="s2">for the first time in what anything is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:41.750" style="s2">technology makes it possible where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.100" end="00:21:42.549" style="s2">having this conversation and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.750" end="00:21:44.750" style="s2">people that are gonna listen</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.549" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">conversation and have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.750" end="00:21:48.860" style="s2">about this conversation in or tolerable</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:52.220" style="s2">Heidegger they&#39;ve never went to college</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.860" end="00:21:54.380" style="s2">yes oh yeah for sure yeah yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.220" end="00:21:57.320" style="s2">movement of you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.380" end="00:22:00.770" style="s2">that I think Peterson really reveals</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:02.990" style="s2">right yeah fears is that people actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">have an attention span a like they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.990" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">really do want to think about deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:10.160" style="s2">things and they will at them like and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.370" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">they&#39;ll consider really be into it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.160" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">it changes lives right yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.590" end="00:22:15.950" style="s2">Peterson is easy debate I mean that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.380" style="s2">like if you usually watch things at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.950" end="00:22:24.200" style="s2">time who had thought that right it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.380" end="00:22:26.299" style="s2">be a big like something it was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.200" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">you know look at it like you know but of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.299" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">course it didn&#39;t play out like I thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:33.650" style="s2">it would you know but I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:35.150" style="s2">like he talks because I I mean I love</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.650" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">these days work to them yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.150" end="00:22:41.770" style="s2">written about him multiple times he kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">of is someone who is trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.770" end="00:22:46.730" style="s2">philosophy be more than just philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:48.710" style="s2">like he&#39;s really yeah using it in ways</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:51.500" style="s2">they can this speak to people he writes</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.710" end="00:22:53.299" style="s2">books that are not necessarily for</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.500" end="00:22:55.790" style="s2">academics they&#39;re for anybody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.299" end="00:22:57.230" style="s2">interested a builder or Heidegger or you</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.790" end="00:22:59.870" style="s2">know look on you know a psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.230" end="00:23:01.160" style="s2">so he&#39;s really popularizing things and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.870" end="00:23:03.980" style="s2">of course Peterson the same way I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.160" end="00:23:08.679" style="s2">he he&#39;s doing a lot for his field but</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.980" end="00:23:11.510" style="s2">also becoming part of a pop culture of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.679" end="00:23:13.160" style="s2">public intellectual that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.510" end="00:23:15.290" style="s2">as many of these days you know kid out</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:21.500" style="s2">centerpieces of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.860" end="00:23:22.850" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s not all tears I mean you</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.850" end="00:23:25.880" style="s2">used to be a time or like hiding or</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.140" style="s2">going these interviews and in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.880" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">interview for days but you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.140" end="00:23:32.270" style="s2">that too much anymore geez you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:34.250" style="s2">not the same you know yeah and but they</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.270" end="00:23:36.380" style="s2">better yeah they get Peterson I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.250" end="00:23:37.870" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s other Stoops that have come to</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.380" end="00:23:41.000" style="s2">me they&#39;ve asked me questions about</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.870" end="00:23:42.380" style="s2">Peterson and psychoanalysis and Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.000" end="00:23:43.580" style="s2">for example I think the other week a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.380" end="00:23:46.220" style="s2">student asked about parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.580" end="00:23:47.750" style="s2">computer on my will you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.220" end="00:23:49.820" style="s2">you might you might want to read Marx</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.750" end="00:23:51.799" style="s2">although more carefully I mean I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.820" end="00:23:53.870" style="s2">saying Peter said it wrong I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.799" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">a take and his multiple take you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.870" end="00:23:57.710" style="s2">have before that&#39;s not the only take</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.240" style="s2">yeah and so much to go back to that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.710" end="00:24:01.340" style="s2">can get a better handle of what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.240" end="00:24:02.870" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about and see where you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.340" end="00:24:05.990" style="s2">stand on it which I think important</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.870" end="00:24:07.910" style="s2">right I think it Hank my friend Doug</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.990" end="00:24:11.030" style="s2">Chris who you&#39;d really like a lot he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.910" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">but he says about Peterson he says you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.030" end="00:24:16.910" style="s2">know he I think he says thing more than</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:19.790" style="s2">a psychologist more than a bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.910" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">cultural commentator more than all eight</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.790" end="00:24:30.040" style="s2">he&#39;s a pretty yeah definitely he he is</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:34.100" style="s2">yeah he sermonize is what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.040" end="00:24:36.260" style="s2">that&#39;s me in the watch in many ways like</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.100" end="00:24:41.270" style="s2">it&#39;s great he&#39;s revealing the need for</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.260" end="00:24:43.940" style="s2">father ship that&#39;s yeah right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.270" end="00:24:45.890" style="s2">he makes a lot of you know good sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.940" end="00:24:48.200" style="s2">assessments that I think open up</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.890" end="00:24:50.090" style="s2">conversations about things in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.200" end="00:24:51.950" style="s2">would never have happened before right</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.090" end="00:24:55.010" style="s2">but I think we need more of I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.950" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">know the idea having the intellectual is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.010" end="00:24:58.730" style="s2">someone that is not necessarily how you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.770" style="s2">think how to think but there&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.730" end="00:25:02.929" style="s2">that just opens questions like Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.770" end="00:25:05.929" style="s2">does I mean Socrates tells theaetetus</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.929" end="00:25:07.460" style="s2">you know you know I&#39;m not here to to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.929" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">someone to tell you what the answers are</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.460" end="00:25:11.660" style="s2">I&#39;m here to be a midwife right each on</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.190" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">the path toward thinking which i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.660" end="00:25:16.820" style="s2">is what we really need I think in terms</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:19.429" style="s2">of intellectual progression doctor I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.820" end="00:25:21.850" style="s2">think when you&#39;re talking about this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.429" end="00:25:23.800" style="s2">just getting a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.850" end="00:25:27.700" style="s2">this is what I think that people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.800" end="00:25:32.170" style="s2">starting to understand is that to really</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.700" end="00:25:34.780" style="s2">do philosophy oh right yeah it takes</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.170" end="00:25:35.170" style="s2">it&#39;s an act of courage yeah for sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.780" end="00:25:38.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.170" end="00:25:41.590" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s a dignity in in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.800" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">act of questioning which is not a badass</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.590" end="00:25:50.680" style="s2">right yeah because it&#39;s you&#39;re opening</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.680" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2">awestruck in the Wonder but it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.220" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">gotta confront it&#39;s like II it&#39;s messy</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:03.130" style="s2">business you know it&#39;s like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:05.290" style="s2">not fronting things like what no and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.130" end="00:26:08.650" style="s2">that actually take courage so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.290" end="00:26:11.050" style="s2">this kind of feedback this hotter poetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.650" end="00:26:14.020" style="s2">feedback loop of where where it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.050" end="00:26:15.850" style="s2">can be it&#39;s really an adventurous yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.020" end="00:26:17.620" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s the excitement is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.850" end="00:26:20.350" style="s2">just being at the edge of somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.620" end="00:26:22.270" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something about us there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.350" end="00:26:28.900" style="s2">something about does not write about</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.850" end="00:30:21.310" style="s2">mm-hmm that being prone to those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.980" end="00:30:23.100" style="s2">of things I think seems to be spilling</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.310" end="00:30:25.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed how encouraging it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.100" end="00:30:27.550" style="s2">mm-hmm and it doesn&#39;t even have to have</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.550" end="00:30:33.070" style="s2">could be like things I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.770" end="00:30:35.590" style="s2">pretending but like I just Epiphany of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.070" end="00:30:37.930" style="s2">some sort something yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.590" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">something that just kind of achieved you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.930" end="00:30:42.820" style="s2">in some way that you hadn&#39;t been before</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:45.280" style="s2">calibrates me yes it realizes like oh</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.280" end="00:30:49.030" style="s2">and looking for it but like it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.990" end="00:30:52.840" style="s2">already here and that already always</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.030" end="00:30:57.430" style="s2">nest I feel like there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.840" end="00:31:01.450" style="s2">faith mmm but I feel about there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.430" end="00:31:03.430" style="s2">an index of like a trust of uh that no</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.450" end="00:31:05.820" style="s2">that&#39;s like an awakening of like know</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.430" end="00:31:10.090" style="s2">there&#39;s an intelligibility that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.820" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t need even my a piston</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.090" end="00:31:15.610" style="s2">piston a right here right where bigger</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:18.430" style="s2">than I am that I&#39;m inside of it I&#39;m of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.610" end="00:31:20.010" style="s2">it and that I can recognize myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.430" end="00:31:23.560" style="s2">having it already</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.010" end="00:31:26.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m Lovell there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.560" end="00:31:30.820" style="s2">that and I think is a kind of faith that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.680" end="00:31:32.620" style="s2">I that that just can kind of awaken yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.820" end="00:31:34.090" style="s2">nothing Heidegger for sure I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.620" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">think he&#39;s definitely there and being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.090" end="00:31:39.220" style="s2">time and I&#39;ve often wondered you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of debates on why he never</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.220" end="00:31:44.170" style="s2">finished he gave his own reason why he</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:47.800" style="s2">never finished it but I think that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.170" end="00:31:51.100" style="s2">could be that either he the the way the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.800" end="00:31:54.370" style="s2">path he was taking that book was to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.100" end="00:31:56.290" style="s2">point that he felt like he could not he</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.370" end="00:31:58.179" style="s2">could no longer articulated anyway</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.290" end="00:32:00.249" style="s2">because it was something that was too</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.179" end="00:32:02.230" style="s2">head of all rays all readiness to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.249" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">something that was already there so how</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.230" end="00:32:07.179" style="s2">are you going to articulate something</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:09.490" style="s2">away which language reduces and language</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.179" end="00:32:13.419" style="s2">confines or something like that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.490" end="00:32:16.119" style="s2">beyond anything they went like what</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.419" end="00:32:25.929" style="s2">language to fuck what is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.119" end="00:32:28.179" style="s2">called language or something you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.929" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">good handle of like what this is where a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.179" end="00:32:33.580" style="s2">lot of theologians you know really turn</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:36.220" style="s2">to it I do because they see in him De</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.580" end="00:32:38.740" style="s2">Stijl article underpinnings to his work</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.220" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s very obvious even though he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:42.669" style="s2">never saying theology he&#39;s never seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:45.460" style="s2">God but it&#39;s something that&#39;s underneath</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.669" end="00:32:48.639" style="s2">it that is always speaking to things</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.460" end="00:32:51.899" style="s2">that exist in a way that make the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.639" end="00:32:53.889" style="s2">be what it is but then is something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.899" end="00:32:55.570" style="s2">requires us to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.889" end="00:32:57.879" style="s2">transcendent way like we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.570" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">about it outside of the body in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.879" end="00:33:01.029" style="s2">certain way and that&#39;s why I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:02.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why he&#39;s never really you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.029" end="00:33:04.299" style="s2">here&#39;s really he&#39;s not concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.200" end="00:33:06.639" style="s2">the body that same way he&#39;s were</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.299" end="00:33:08.980" style="s2">concerned with these transcendent things</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.639" end="00:33:10.419" style="s2">so of course Marla Ponte comes in and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.980" end="00:33:12.009" style="s2">tries to including the body but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.419" end="00:33:14.139" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s his own take but</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.009" end="00:33:16.590" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s are concerned with what</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.139" end="00:33:18.940" style="s2">makes the body the body and it would mix</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.590" end="00:33:21.159" style="s2">makes them makes the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.940" end="00:33:24.340" style="s2">the body he&#39;s concerned with the levels</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.159" end="00:33:26.980" style="s2">removed beyond that ya know the body is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.340" end="00:33:28.899" style="s2">just the throne is what makes this</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.980" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">throne this happen you know if it makes</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.899" end="00:33:33.490" style="s2">this anxiety happen what makes</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:35.619" style="s2">temporality happen yeah he&#39;s looking at</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.490" end="00:33:37.720" style="s2">that on a more deeper level right which</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.619" end="00:33:42.190" style="s2">speak would speak to this idea so he</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.720" end="00:33:44.350" style="s2">does who has whole career he says he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.190" end="00:33:47.379" style="s2">touching different pieces and he so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.350" end="00:33:48.990" style="s2">see a trajectory his career where often</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.379" end="00:33:51.730" style="s2">some peepers have said well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.990" end="00:33:53.230" style="s2">early Heidegger later that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.730" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">to say he&#39;s doing something different</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.230" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">later period versus really how did he</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:33:59.230" style="s2">throw the same thing you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:34:03.549" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.230" end="00:34:05.139" style="s2">you know with my mentors like he&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.549" end="00:34:07.570" style="s2">he&#39;s never taken his eye off the ball</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.139" end="00:34:10.119" style="s2">and he&#39;s just that he&#39;s trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.570" end="00:34:11.550" style="s2">out how can I circle back and get</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.119" end="00:34:13.650" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.550" end="00:34:15.030" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t have before and then and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.650" end="00:34:17.490" style="s2">then once I learned some more come back</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.030" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">again and again and then include this</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.490" end="00:34:20.880" style="s2">thinker go to the Hegel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">he go his career he&#39;s going to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.880" end="00:34:26.400" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out how to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:28.260" style="s2">know I say this better and of course you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.400" end="00:34:29.880" style="s2">got the Nazism thing which was a circle</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.260" end="00:34:32.490" style="s2">attached to he was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.880" end="00:34:34.830" style="s2">how is this pure principle gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.490" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna help awaken this</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.830" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">on concealment oh it&#39;s not and when he</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:39.929" style="s2">come back around again and you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">just constantly going through these</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.929" end="00:34:44.970" style="s2">paths do you know when he gets the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:47.490" style="s2">of his career he&#39;s he arrives at poetry</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.970" end="00:34:50.040" style="s2">and language you know and thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.490" end="00:34:51.570" style="s2">the big thinker in literal God you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.040" end="00:34:53.580" style="s2">it&#39;s so funny because it&#39;s like on some</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.570" end="00:34:59.070" style="s2">level this is so I think that people can</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.580" end="00:35:03.300" style="s2">just really relate to just I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.070" end="00:35:05.730" style="s2">doing X Y &amp; Z because of this but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.300" end="00:35:07.860" style="s2">actually kind of moved towards it and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.730" end="00:35:10.410" style="s2">get to this and I realized the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.860" end="00:35:14.210" style="s2">time what I really was doing was this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.410" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">and so change history right but</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.210" end="00:35:22.530" style="s2">constantly happening this somehow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">bigger than us but it and it constants</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.530" end="00:35:29.340" style="s2">ahead of us behind us but like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:30.810" style="s2">the matter is never settled exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.340" end="00:35:33.300" style="s2">constantly like he&#39;s constantly trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.810" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">to settle those things and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.300" end="00:35:37.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why sometimes he looked at as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:40.230" style="s2">you know some people that are detractors</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.770" end="00:35:42.120" style="s2">of Heidegger might say oh whoa he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.230" end="00:35:43.620" style="s2">a Frankenstein philosopher and she was</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.120" end="00:35:46.170" style="s2">putting pieces together I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.620" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">using he&#39;s Jews enough reggae he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.170" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">our deal tie and these different people</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">are putting together but he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:55.470" style="s2">then hone in on something that they</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t own and yet he&#39;s using them as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.470" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">stepping stool but it becomes a step</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:02.220" style="s2">until he pushes away these were served</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:05.160" style="s2">with how do I circle back and how do I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.220" end="00:36:07.080" style="s2">keep figuring out race and I&#39;m better</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.160" end="00:36:08.610" style="s2">way and that&#39;s basically is words you</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.080" end="00:36:11.310" style="s2">know like dials on is something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.610" end="00:36:13.050" style="s2">nobody&#39;s existence but it has a much</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.310" end="00:36:16.770" style="s2">more nuance it has the idea of fairness</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.050" end="00:36:19.350" style="s2">going on and as a side deal of being in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.770" end="00:36:24.380" style="s2">terms of lower case B upper case B and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.350" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">then this idea of a sign in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.380" end="00:36:29.480" style="s2">having a sort of a maybe a musicality to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:31.190" style="s2">an aesthetic to that I think is beneath</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.480" end="00:36:33.619" style="s2">that which I think he&#39;s playing into too</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.190" end="00:36:35.269" style="s2">so that all these things are kind of on</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.619" end="00:36:37.579" style="s2">the phone the forefront of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.269" end="00:36:38.809" style="s2">doing so then by the time he gets the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.579" end="00:36:41.029" style="s2">end of his career and he started looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.809" end="00:36:42.289" style="s2">at all the pre-socratics he&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.029" end="00:36:45.829" style="s2">that they are the ones that have already</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.289" end="00:36:47.869" style="s2">been doing this well before Plato so now</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.829" end="00:36:49.519" style="s2">if I can go back to them then I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.869" end="00:36:51.950" style="s2">figure out where we&#39;ve gone wrong since</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.519" end="00:36:53.660" style="s2">Plato in a way that I didn&#39;t do it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.950" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">what&#39;s the thought what&#39;s the thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.660" end="00:37:00.920" style="s2">that parameters did you that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">think a new beginning right the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.920" end="00:37:06.170" style="s2">beginning words like it kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:09.170" style="s2">back in the atmosphere before that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.170" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">thought got crystallized he kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.170" end="00:37:13.430" style="s2">no and it could have gone this way any</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">good he goes all right so let&#39;s replay</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.430" end="00:37:18.769" style="s2">all of history we get the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:24.799" style="s2">yeah he has no idea where he&#39;s gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.769" end="00:37:26.809" style="s2">up in the musicality in the tone us of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.799" end="00:37:29.299" style="s2">like I think I&#39;m really getting what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.809" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">mean by the aesthetic that it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.299" end="00:37:34.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like when a it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">beauty of it it&#39;s the intelligibility of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.279" end="00:37:40.190" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s not the proposition right</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:43.460" style="s2">decisions are just the weave the fabric</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.190" end="00:37:45.829" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s always just kind of right</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.460" end="00:37:47.509" style="s2">there and that&#39;s the thing I thought one</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.829" end="00:37:49.490" style="s2">of the most interesting things is when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.509" end="00:37:51.140" style="s2">heard someone say that like Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.490" end="00:37:54.230" style="s2">refuse and his collecting works he</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.140" end="00:37:57.019" style="s2">refused to put an index yeah true I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.230" end="00:37:59.660" style="s2">think that is that is this there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.019" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot because it says what he</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.660" end="00:38:04.099" style="s2">he&#39;s like in it sometimes people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:07.089" style="s2">write me in the last me what was</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.099" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s view on done it a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.089" end="00:38:14.150" style="s2">don&#39;t think Heidegger had Jews I hear a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:16.609" style="s2">really yeah I think for him I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:19.190" style="s2">his directive for the collective works</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.609" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">were that they be ways not works yes I</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.190" end="00:38:24.589" style="s2">heard was so he&#39;s conserved that so how</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:27.829" style="s2">are these ways of thinking that lead for</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.589" end="00:38:29.150" style="s2">different paths and not about titles and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.829" end="00:38:30.859" style="s2">works and things like that so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.150" end="00:38:32.779" style="s2">you see the dem order in a way where he</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.859" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">has like being a time is number two and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.779" end="00:38:36.410" style="s2">then he&#39;s got like his early stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:37.849" style="s2">number one and then everything he does</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.410" end="00:38:39.890" style="s2">after that are all like</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.849" end="00:38:41.569" style="s2">other things and then you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.890" end="00:38:43.819" style="s2">very end where he&#39;s got journals and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.569" end="00:38:46.339" style="s2">stuff like this and diary like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.819" end="00:38:48.739" style="s2">where he is the journal entries are just</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.339" end="00:38:52.430" style="s2">healed constantly retooling constantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.739" end="00:38:54.440" style="s2">we articulate and constantly retreading</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.430" end="00:38:55.940" style="s2">past he&#39;s had before in order to get new</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.440" end="00:38:58.130" style="s2">thinking in new ways of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.940" end="00:39:01.130" style="s2">things he did wanted stuff to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.130" end="00:39:02.509" style="s2">codified that was right yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.130" end="00:39:04.009" style="s2">it&#39;s like when he talked about like</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.509" end="00:39:06.259" style="s2">people make fun of him a lot because he</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.009" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">said you know he&#39;s he never says I well</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.259" end="00:39:08.869" style="s2">I thought that he says thinking exactly</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:10.489" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.869" end="00:39:12.920" style="s2">what is that think about like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.489" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">actually this is this is why what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.920" end="00:39:18.229" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s something that being</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:20.420" style="s2">communicated in just that move right</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.229" end="00:39:23.150" style="s2">here I think it&#39;s like almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.420" end="00:39:25.880" style="s2">practice of like like I I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.150" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">actually general semantics has this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.880" end="00:39:30.739" style="s2">thing about consciousness abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:33.799" style="s2">where they&#39;re like don&#39;t use is and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.739" end="00:39:36.380" style="s2">know it&#39;s this practice that forces you</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.799" end="00:39:40.150" style="s2">to distinguish back from territory right</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:42.680" style="s2">and lately that territory is Nitin is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.150" end="00:39:44.209" style="s2">like you&#39;re looking to the territory for</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.680" end="00:39:47.299" style="s2">that right yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.209" end="00:39:49.309" style="s2">he&#39;s like embedded philosophical kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.299" end="00:39:52.489" style="s2">practices that I think that he was</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.309" end="00:39:54.140" style="s2">constantly doing mmm-hmm that was a way</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.489" end="00:39:56.119" style="s2">to do it to say that you know instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.140" end="00:39:57.529" style="s2">saying that I have a question that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.119" end="00:39:58.940" style="s2">want to ask you say there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.529" end="00:40:00.769" style="s2">that wish to be asked when you talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.940" end="00:40:03.229" style="s2">about this like really abstract way like</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.769" end="00:40:05.839" style="s2">right like the question is is its own</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.229" end="00:40:07.969" style="s2">thing in his own entity you know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.839" end="00:40:09.380" style="s2">then begs to ask its own question and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.969" end="00:40:12.109" style="s2">leaving the human out of it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.380" end="00:40:14.180" style="s2">always this sort of a yeah compartment I</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.109" end="00:40:15.709" style="s2">mean severe because it&#39;s beautiful you</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.180" end="00:40:18.769" style="s2">hear it but it&#39;s kind of jarring for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.709" end="00:40:20.779" style="s2">first time what I did say I asked the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.769" end="00:40:24.459" style="s2">question it&#39;s more to than that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.779" end="00:40:27.199" style="s2">trying to articulate in the way that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.459" end="00:40:30.559" style="s2">honing in on the question and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.199" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">letting the question be superseded or be</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.559" end="00:40:34.759" style="s2">controlled by the I the subject the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:36.109" style="s2">subject obviously stations are very</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.759" end="00:40:38.359" style="s2">important for him he&#39;s trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.109" end="00:40:40.759" style="s2">beyond that right he&#39;s this Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.359" end="00:40:42.410" style="s2">problem that they cart kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.759" end="00:40:44.049" style="s2">pushes out in the world he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.410" end="00:40:46.609" style="s2">gonna be on that by saying that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.049" end="00:40:49.039" style="s2">everything is its own entity and every</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.609" end="00:40:51.150" style="s2">entity has its own voice yeah its own</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.039" end="00:40:53.060" style="s2">sort of the static its own</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.150" end="00:40:57.740" style="s2">presented his own being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.060" end="00:40:57.740" style="s2">within the temporality which is exist</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.580" end="00:41:04.710" style="s2">that like like yeah unconcealed but</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.980" end="00:41:07.820" style="s2">conceals at the same time like next day</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.710" end="00:41:11.010" style="s2">I think I really kind of got it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.820" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">like we&#39;re like after being I know he</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.010" end="00:41:15.780" style="s2">talked about he wanted to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:16.680" style="s2">fundamental ontology but I got this he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.780" end="00:41:18.630" style="s2">like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.680" end="00:41:26.010" style="s2">there ain&#39;t nothing fundamental here</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.630" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I&#39;m still using ontology</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.010" end="00:41:29.490" style="s2">I&#39;m still using ontology that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:31.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem so you know move away</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.490" end="00:41:33.620" style="s2">from that yeah so then he starts saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.260" end="00:41:35.730" style="s2">well let me look at in terms of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.620" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re talking about metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.730" end="00:41:37.470" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.290" style="s2">well I don&#39;t really use that either</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.470" end="00:41:42.150" style="s2">because that&#39;s still ruin it ideas with</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.290" end="00:41:44.820" style="s2">metaphysics are then you know then we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.150" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">to human ears we go to a lathe you like</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.820" end="00:41:49.170" style="s2">a seelman and that for him but those</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:52.710" style="s2">more of a pure path right a pure</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.170" end="00:41:54.420" style="s2">reservoir that does can&#39;t be more heavy</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.710" end="00:41:57.870" style="s2">lifting than what he&#39;s doing before</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.420" end="00:41:59.430" style="s2">nothing yeah in a very different way do</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.870" end="00:42:01.350" style="s2">you think about that just in your like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.430" end="00:42:03.540" style="s2">just admit just imagine just think about</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.550" end="00:42:43.410" style="s2">am i because I think that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.200" end="00:42:46.500" style="s2">sense of like a your identity is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.410" end="00:42:50.250" style="s2">kind of that can Kinki there&#39;s ways in</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.250" end="00:42:56.190" style="s2">good there&#39;s other ways your attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:43:00.300" style="s2">needs to see something or something</p>

<p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:09.859" style="s2">then that&#39;s right that takes something</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.099" end="00:43:11.180" style="s2">actually here that does it once you hear</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.859" end="00:43:12.920" style="s2">it the way he hears it he&#39;s like why</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.180" end="00:43:15.619" style="s2">continue to write this book because now</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.920" end="00:43:17.330" style="s2">it&#39;s obsolete it doesn&#39;t he says that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.619" end="00:43:20.180" style="s2">he&#39;s like he said being in time he says</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.330" end="00:43:22.700" style="s2">never lived up to the task</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.180" end="00:43:26.420" style="s2">reached his full fruition because he</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.700" end="00:43:27.980" style="s2">realized as he wrote it that I&#39;m the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.420" end="00:43:29.630" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate is never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.980" end="00:43:32.180" style="s2">be calculated in this this is never</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.630" end="00:43:34.130" style="s2">going to get there so so he I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.180" end="00:43:37.070" style="s2">leaves I mean there&#39;s a whole half of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.130" end="00:43:38.690" style="s2">every rope so he wrote he has lectures</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.070" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">that people have often looked at as</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.690" end="00:43:43.700" style="s2">being ways to fill in when he left out</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:45.080" style="s2">of the book but he&#39;s well beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.700" end="00:43:47.300" style="s2">book by the time we get to the you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.080" end="00:43:48.530" style="s2">late twenties early thirties well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.300" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">doing with other things about it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.530" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">concerned with truth and you concerned</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.930" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">time becomes a one of the I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:10.970" style="s2">the most interesting unfinished books of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:13.070" style="s2">philosophy that&#39;s out there every you</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.970" end="00:44:14.930" style="s2">know to have a complete or complete and</p>

<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:27.050" style="s2">he has another book later on called</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.339" end="00:44:29.180" style="s2">existence and be the age I think is</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.050" end="00:44:31.640" style="s2">trying to talk about the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.180" end="00:44:34.040" style="s2">me anytime but it doesn&#39;t really try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.640" end="00:44:37.609" style="s2">go any further than that you know I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.040" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">to have a copy all right on it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.609" end="00:44:48.920" style="s2">always like it&#39;s always go by be I&#39;ve I</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.920" end="00:44:53.060" style="s2">start thinking about like ecstatic time</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.810" end="00:44:55.430" style="s2">right and then you know he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.060" end="00:44:57.619" style="s2">right in the beginning of the reckoning</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.430" end="00:44:59.089" style="s2">of being a time he talks about where you</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.619" end="00:45:02.030" style="s2">know and I think he&#39;s responding</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.089" end="00:45:07.089" style="s2">he&#39;s breaking open Hegel right Hegel is</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.030" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">complete you can&#39;t like everything big</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.089" end="00:45:12.500" style="s2">Hegel is a system is just about anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:15.230" style="s2">that was right yeah Hegel&#39;s tries to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.500" end="00:45:16.520" style="s2">categorize everything that&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.230" end="00:45:17.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s what happens when he</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.520" end="00:45:21.970" style="s2">put at like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.410" end="00:45:23.620" style="s2">actualities as as the king in Hydra he</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.970" end="00:45:25.210" style="s2">says right like in the first couple of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.620" end="00:45:31.930" style="s2">pages I think he said talks about like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.210" end="00:45:34.210" style="s2">no it&#39;s possibility is above xx like</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.040" end="00:47:49.550" style="s2">kind of begin it but they aren&#39;t the end</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.540" end="00:47:50.780" style="s2">of you and it cuz you can disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.550" end="00:47:52.430" style="s2">them to you have to think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.780" end="00:47:55.640" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s correct he could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.430" end="00:47:57.500" style="s2">yeah you know he&#39;s right at a time it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.640" end="00:47:59.420" style="s2">rule from our time and so there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.500" end="00:47:59.840" style="s2">mean that he&#39;s correct he can be missing</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.420" end="00:48:01.610" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.840" end="00:48:04.760" style="s2">so they they have an issue with trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.610" end="00:48:07.310" style="s2">to actually counter these thinkers in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.760" end="00:48:08.810" style="s2">way that right Breen&#39;s what they think</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.310" end="00:48:10.550" style="s2">to the folds and the more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.810" end="00:48:12.500" style="s2">way I think we have an issue with that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.550" end="00:48:17.540" style="s2">some okay so I I have I have taught I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:19.010" style="s2">thought they get just perplexed by the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.540" end="00:48:20.150" style="s2">language I think and that throws them</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.010" end="00:48:22.010" style="s2">off I&#39;m like well don&#39;t worry about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.150" end="00:48:24.710" style="s2">language just look at what words do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.010" end="00:48:26.180" style="s2">know yeah and then how is he using these</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.710" end="00:48:28.460" style="s2">words in a way they&#39;re different from</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.180" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">what you would use where that beat you</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.460" end="00:48:30.710" style="s2">and then go from there</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.630" end="00:48:32.690" style="s2">yeah I mean you know what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.710" end="00:48:35.300" style="s2">time it is you know a being means so</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.690" end="00:48:37.330" style="s2">where&#39;s the why is he time those to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.300" end="00:48:40.820" style="s2">that way and what is at stake what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.330" end="00:48:43.190" style="s2">what sort of impact does that have on</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.820" end="00:48:44.750" style="s2">how we look at these two words right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.190" end="00:48:47.590" style="s2">you know I think they become gives more</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.750" end="00:48:52.940" style="s2">insight to them that way yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.590" end="00:48:54.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed like in teaching and to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.940" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">wait first of all you just don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.620" end="00:48:59.240" style="s2">any control like I&#39;ve just noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">like a waiter the stuff you have about a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.240" end="00:49:02.980" style="s2">hill that&#39;s notice like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.940" end="00:49:10.280" style="s2">methods but like there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:13.370" style="s2">wild thing about people&#39;s freedom but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.280" end="00:49:16.010" style="s2">I get I think one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.370" end="00:49:17.810" style="s2">think with social media it&#39;s almost it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.010" end="00:49:21.080" style="s2">almost impossible to comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.810" end="00:49:26.080" style="s2">to what degree we are going to buy it</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.080" end="00:49:29.150" style="s2">right imagine it&#39;s just it&#39;s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.080" end="00:49:34.310" style="s2">you know it&#39;s only been 15 years that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.150" end="00:49:35.990" style="s2">yeah yeah hey but we&#39;re now having kids</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.310" end="00:49:40.310" style="s2">that don&#39;t have a memory before the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.990" end="00:49:42.660" style="s2">Internet and so what the real brain mmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.310" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">different yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.660" end="00:49:47.579" style="s2">he&#39;s just and there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.130" end="00:49:49.799" style="s2">understand it but it passionately like</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.579" end="00:49:52.200" style="s2">these new technological structures</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.799" end="00:49:54.539" style="s2">aren&#39;t just like it is inside of your</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.200" end="00:49:58.470" style="s2">talked about they&#39;re not just the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.539" end="00:50:02.369" style="s2">gadgets but then they&#39;re that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.470" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">understanding of being right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.369" end="00:50:08.759" style="s2">scale deserve right here right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.450" end="00:50:11.369" style="s2">more like it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I get the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.759" end="00:50:13.950" style="s2">senses at our time in technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.369" end="00:50:17.519" style="s2">dominance of it kind of figure eise&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.950" end="00:50:19.230" style="s2">all ground right it&#39;s it just the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.519" end="00:50:22.230" style="s2">the moment there&#39;s background it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.230" end="00:50:24.599" style="s2">figure eise&#39;s and it is it doesn&#39;t sway</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.230" end="00:50:26.670" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t it all point to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.599" end="00:50:31.790" style="s2">background sure yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.670" end="00:50:33.290" style="s2">pretty background and seeing that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.790" end="00:50:36.050" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.290" end="00:50:41.180" style="s2">this sense especially with with with</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.050" end="00:50:45.550" style="s2">with philosophy at this level to spend</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.180" end="00:50:45.550" style="s2">time at something that&#39;s difficult right</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:52.040" style="s2">that isn&#39;t immediately useful</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.740" end="00:50:54.320" style="s2">yeah right right it&#39;s just almost to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.040" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">point where I think I think is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.320" end="00:50:59.480" style="s2">almost to the point where I think kids</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:51:01.820" style="s2">probably can&#39;t even perceive their minds</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.480" end="00:51:03.980" style="s2">are just not able to teach channel at</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.820" end="00:51:05.960" style="s2">the abstract way like that because they</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.980" end="00:51:09.530" style="s2">have I guess that muscle just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.960" end="00:51:11.450" style="s2">there not is prefigured and then this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.530" end="00:51:13.730" style="s2">transfigured so it&#39;s like prefiguring</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.450" end="00:51:15.380" style="s2">and then like all the work is done so</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.730" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">then they don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.380" end="00:51:20.330" style="s2">their their reality is given versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:21.770" style="s2">constructing your own reality by a stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.330" end="00:51:23.060" style="s2">on what you encounter you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.770" end="00:51:25.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have this so when they read like</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.060" end="00:51:29.270" style="s2">Aristotle or Plato he like world</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.520" end="00:51:33.640" style="s2">well what is he saying like today he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.270" end="00:51:33.640" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a gap can&#39;t you just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.810" end="00:51:40.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no right or wrong answer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.830" end="00:51:43.160" style="s2">like dude ask people how many different</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.940" end="00:51:45.950" style="s2">ways can you interpret Aristotle but</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.160" end="00:51:47.750" style="s2">they&#39;re like well I mean any number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.950" end="00:51:49.490" style="s2">ways depend upon what you bring to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.750" end="00:51:52.670" style="s2">table when you read it yeah course you</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.490" end="00:51:54.740" style="s2">understand the language so it could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.670" end="00:51:56.120" style="s2">millions of different ways no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.740" end="00:51:58.910" style="s2">not growing waiting I say so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.120" end="00:52:00.650" style="s2">figure out what way speaks to you based</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.910" end="00:52:02.840" style="s2">on what you know and they&#39;d be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.650" end="00:52:04.790" style="s2">get something from this that&#39;s me you</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.840" end="00:52:07.070" style="s2">know and so I think even I say that some</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.790" end="00:52:08.900" style="s2">students I mean you can tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.070" end="00:52:10.280" style="s2">they&#39;re sweating I mean you see the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.900" end="00:52:12.710" style="s2">smoke coming off their hands and this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.280" end="00:52:15.350" style="s2">this is like really yeah heavy lifting</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.710" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">we think about like read this text and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.350" end="00:52:18.380" style="s2">then tell me what you think of it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">just gonna sit back I&#39;m just gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.380" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">you some brief kind of frame you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:25.130" style="s2">this is playlist there is foul and kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:28.280" style="s2">of Facebook you have to do all the work</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.130" end="00:52:31.070" style="s2">yeah that stuff is like really taxing</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.280" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">for them to do that - anything - and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.070" end="00:52:35.150" style="s2">guess I you know I mean I know you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:37.730" style="s2">think of this - you speak of this as</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.150" end="00:52:39.080" style="s2">well was like you know when when I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.730" end="00:52:40.910" style="s2">growing up on me you know I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.080" end="00:52:43.190" style="s2">reading all these other thinkers I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.910" end="00:52:44.780" style="s2">reading uh looking at Leonardo da</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.190" end="00:52:45.500" style="s2">Vinci&#39;s work and dealing with work you</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.780" end="00:52:47.870" style="s2">know and slide</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.500" end="00:52:49.340" style="s2">you know I did all it on my own I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.870" end="00:52:50.570" style="s2">anybody telling me like you know hey</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.340" end="00:52:53.030" style="s2">this is what you think this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.570" end="00:52:54.710" style="s2">the piata this is like architects look</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.030" end="00:52:58.780" style="s2">at my order you know figured out a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.710" end="00:53:01.250" style="s2">moment and then it became a more organic</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.780" end="00:53:03.830" style="s2">experience than one that is packaged and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.250" end="00:53:05.480" style="s2">you know prefigured and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.830" end="00:53:08.330" style="s2">thing I think these tools Nadi&#39;s don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.480" end="00:53:10.310" style="s2">have right whatever don&#39;t have you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.330" end="00:53:11.600" style="s2">yeah and then and then the attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.310" end="00:53:13.130" style="s2">span is a whole different thing like</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.600" end="00:53:14.330" style="s2">your attention span really short so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.130" end="00:53:16.330" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for sound bytes looking</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.330" end="00:53:18.910" style="s2">for things that are easily digestible</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:20.930" style="s2">which I think if you&#39;re gonna read</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.910" end="00:53:25.220" style="s2">Heidegger you&#39;re not gonna get him and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.930" end="00:53:27.140" style="s2">just you know two minutes you have to</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.140" end="00:53:31.670" style="s2">tired you know I bet I would be probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.260" end="00:53:37.430" style="s2">hundreds of times make it something</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.670" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">different every time and I thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.430" end="00:53:40.490" style="s2">like it&#39;s like that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:44.120" style="s2">little scary</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.490" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">yes it&#39;s the challenge of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.120" end="00:53:48.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like I mean human beings will do</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:51.830" style="s2">well you know go through anything if</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.350" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">they like a good enough reason to do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.830" end="00:53:56.510" style="s2">yeah yeah right he&#39;s like people go</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.770" end="00:53:59.570" style="s2">through some enormous amount of pain</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.510" end="00:54:03.170" style="s2">well apparently if it&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.570" end="00:54:05.270" style="s2">enough however I&#39;m just afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.170" end="00:54:09.260" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the way phones</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.320" end="00:57:51.620" style="s2">like that&#39;s a vanishing horizon right</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.240" end="00:57:53.300" style="s2">different world right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.620" end="00:57:55.940" style="s2">different way of thinking yes different</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.300" end="00:57:57.860" style="s2">yeah to say that it&#39;s not like oh I</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.480" end="00:58:04.390" style="s2">like it&#39;s not even it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.630" end="00:58:06.740" style="s2">concealed wasn&#39;t it easier way out</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.390" end="00:58:09.320" style="s2">parents like Heidegger I think was</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.740" end="00:58:12.170" style="s2">really right on them eerily right on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.320" end="00:58:13.820" style="s2">way cuz he&#39;s like saying like the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.170" end="00:58:18.170" style="s2">thing about this age is that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.820" end="00:58:21.050" style="s2">concealed is concealment yes because</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.170" end="00:58:23.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t reveal that it&#39;s concealed</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.050" end="00:58:25.600" style="s2">instead the only thing that we call real</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.420" end="00:58:31.820" style="s2">are things that we can organize position</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.600" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">optimize extreme distances and now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.820" end="00:58:35.420" style="s2">look at just in the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.890" style="s2">it used to like a few years ago it would</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.420" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">have been weird to like think about your</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.890" end="00:58:44.020" style="s2">body and hack it</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:46.700" style="s2">yeah right how what it&#39;s like the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.020" end="00:58:49.010" style="s2">popular way of thinking about things and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.700" end="00:58:51.830" style="s2">here it&#39;s really interesting like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.010" end="00:58:56.450" style="s2">that that that has happened so quickly</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.830" end="00:59:00.230" style="s2">and no one&#39;s walking around really going</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.450" end="00:59:02.090" style="s2">god this is really uncanny for a change</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.230" end="00:59:04.810" style="s2">boom right because it&#39;s there that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.090" end="00:59:09.380" style="s2">there&#39;s that kind of quality where the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.810" end="00:59:13.730" style="s2">strangeness becomes that the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.380" end="00:59:15.590" style="s2">home miss be comes concealed right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.730" end="00:59:17.390" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of concealed with this</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.590" end="00:59:18.530" style="s2">happening in a way that you&#39;ll realize</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.390" end="00:59:20.840" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna see you like it just</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.530" end="00:59:22.490" style="s2">constantly happening yeah and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.840" end="00:59:24.950" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re actually at a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.490" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">disadvantage yet every step first is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.950" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">being it I mean it&#39;s kind of like a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:32.140" style="s2">almost like a boss sense of fun</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:33.610" style="s2">concealment like his it&#39;s a concealed on</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.140" end="00:59:37.600" style="s2">concealment like it seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.610" end="00:59:39.370" style="s2">really there but really is distance</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.600" end="00:59:40.840" style="s2">that&#39;s giving between what we actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.370" end="00:59:42.820" style="s2">are having access so we think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.840" end="00:59:44.650" style="s2">having access to right you know we with</p>

<p begin="01:00:41.890" end="01:00:49.960" style="s2">the person in real life yeah did heal</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.600" end="01:00:51.250" style="s2">with the other Ness and the other yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.960" end="01:00:55.300" style="s2">but there was any other choice</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.250" end="01:00:57.580" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re fighting but if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.300" end="01:01:00.010" style="s2">choice your nervous system isn&#39;t gonna</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.010" end="01:01:05.460" style="s2">somebody when I can just text him like</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.380" end="01:01:08.290" style="s2">exactly all that other nurse right like</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.460" end="01:01:12.070" style="s2">do you think about it that other Ness is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.290" end="01:01:15.720" style="s2">how we come to realize that we are right</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.070" end="01:01:17.890" style="s2">here I relationality which i think is I</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.720" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.890" end="01:01:23.320" style="s2">that is the thing that like I feel</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.010" end="01:01:26.530" style="s2">pretty motivated to just keep looking at</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.320" end="01:01:29.080" style="s2">right you&#39;re right it&#39;s a philosophy is</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.530" end="01:01:31.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a one level it is cut you can go</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.080" end="01:01:33.880" style="s2">into these abstractions but it it</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.030" end="01:01:35.920" style="s2">reveals the thing that&#39;s most near and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.880" end="01:01:38.860" style="s2">think happens through a relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.920" end="01:01:42.730" style="s2">conversation right um</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.860" end="01:01:45.190" style="s2">and and kind of allowing people to start</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.730" end="01:01:46.930" style="s2">to touch in on it is what I like is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.190" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">these kinds of conversations just</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.930" end="01:01:50.920" style="s2">listening to them right swaggin like</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.840" style="s2">like hearing this all the time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.920" end="01:01:56.470" style="s2">like oh I listen to this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.840" end="01:01:58.900" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t even realize like it just</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.470" end="01:02:00.970" style="s2">opened up this whole world right here</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.900" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">right about this whole thing and all of</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.970" end="01:02:06.730" style="s2">a sudden they&#39;re engaged in in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:09.040" style="s2">dialogue because I think it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.730" end="01:02:12.490" style="s2">like our lives you can very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.040" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">easy to run oh it&#39;s easy but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.490" end="01:02:18.190" style="s2">um you can look at a dialogue is like</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:20.380" style="s2">you can look at your relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.190" end="01:02:24.390" style="s2">world as a conversation right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.380" end="01:02:26.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a so it&#39;s this constant sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.390" end="01:02:29.020" style="s2">linguistic interpolation of each other</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.920" end="01:02:31.390" style="s2">like you costly like interpolate and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.020" end="01:02:34.120" style="s2">language and then you become the subject</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.390" end="01:02:37.030" style="s2">and object of language becomes something</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.120" end="01:02:39.490" style="s2">that then compartmentalizes and you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.030" end="01:02:40.870" style="s2">hear you converse it&#39;s all about you</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.180" end="01:03:39.400" style="s2">think I think you got I think be the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.370" end="01:03:41.500" style="s2">gathering is I think essential yeah to</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.400" end="01:03:43.870" style="s2">figure it out all the questions that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.500" end="01:03:46.510" style="s2">think we looked at in terms of hey what</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.870" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">does it mean to the gathering I think is</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.510" end="01:03:51.370" style="s2">the state-based distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:52.700" style="s2">philosophy and philosophy yeah right I</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.370" end="01:03:54.530" style="s2">mean I mean your head</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.700" end="01:03:56.420" style="s2">you know Eagles gathering things but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.530" end="01:03:58.849" style="s2">mean that because philosophy is not</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.420" end="01:04:00.650" style="s2">philosophy right right you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.849" end="01:04:03.260" style="s2">Heidegger then gets a hold of like will</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.650" end="01:04:05.270" style="s2">he focus on the phenomena whose spirit</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.260" end="01:04:07.369" style="s2">is being kind of the way he acts this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.270" end="01:04:10.940" style="s2">Hegel but then Hegel then is something</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.369" end="01:04:12.410" style="s2">that is to philosophy is to rooted in</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.940" end="01:04:13.940" style="s2">tradition yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.410" end="01:04:16.790" style="s2">even though tradition is nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.940" end="01:04:19.010" style="s2">with that but then we can&#39;t be so locked</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.790" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">in that when we lose the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.010" end="01:04:25.040" style="s2">the sort of concealment that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:26.030" style="s2">that we need to get yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.040" end="01:04:28.760" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.030" end="01:04:30.440" style="s2">yeah yeah right now great talking with</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.630" end="01:05:26.750" style="s2">becoming more and more necessary to get</p>
