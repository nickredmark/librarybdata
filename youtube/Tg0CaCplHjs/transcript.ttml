<p begin="00:00:04.640" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">so this is the second part of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.320" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">hopefully ongoing series with John Bob a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">key and Jordan Greenhalgh which was</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:17.910" style="s2">really fascinating we caught up for</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">about an hour a couple of weeks ago and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.910" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">where we got to at that point was John I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:26.599" style="s2">think you were just asking Jordan about</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">his concept of simulated thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.599" end="00:00:31.949" style="s2">simulated thinking versus genuine</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">thinking and how that maps onto your</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.949" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">concept of do I use your</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">concept of John and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">Jordan pick up and say if there are any</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">parallels between the two yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:49.460" style="s2">Kant thinks David and it&#39;s good to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">you again Jordan there the context was</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.460" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">Jordan had given a very clear exposition</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">of you know his take I&#39;d spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:03.170" style="s2">the meeting crisis in a mental fog and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:06.860" style="s2">then he had talked about how that crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.170" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">can be exemplified in a personal way and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.860" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">then that brought up this this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">people people getting into a mental fog</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:18.890" style="s2">and what how that plays out and then he</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">introduced the distinction well</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.890" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">discussed thing that state between</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">simulated thinking and I believe he said</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">real thinking and that that really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">struck a chord with me because that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">seems to connect to some really</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">important ideas you know Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">idea about you know real thinking as</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">opposed to just getting caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:45.570" style="s2">cultural code and then and that that has</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.420" style="s2">had an influence on my thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.570" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">this idea of self deception and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.420" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">bullshitting oneself and that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">is taken from Harry Frankfurt&#39;s work his</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">seminal essay on in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">Frankfurt made an important distinction</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">between lying and bullshitting this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">relevant in two ways because as he</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">pointed out in the essays what I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">20 years old now you know everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">senses that is rising and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the symptoms of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">meaning crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">cultural level it&#39;s important but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">think it&#39;s also important for</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:20.819" style="s2">self-deception and when I let me explain</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.819" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">so the liar is committed to manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">you by your commitment through the truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:30.599" style="s2">of your beliefs so if I get you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">believe that Susan loves you when she</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.599" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t I can manipulate your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">accordingly because you&#39;re committed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:42.269" style="s2">acting on the basis of the truth okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">now Franklin pointed out that unlike the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.269" end="00:02:46.349" style="s2">liar the artist doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">that way the artist manipulates</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.349" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">you by getting you indifferent to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">whether or not something is true and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">then I sort of develop that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">by something that I think is strongly</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">implied in Frankfurt&#39;s work which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2"> artist manipulates you like oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">not only getting you indifferent to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">truth but by getting you caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:10.709" style="s2">the salience of what&#39;s being said how</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">catchy it is and so a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.709" end="00:03:16.099" style="s2">example of this is political discourse</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">or advertising in which the advertiser</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.099" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">presents something that you know is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">true you see somebody drinking alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:25.799" style="s2">in a bar right and they&#39;re immediately</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:27.959" style="s2">surrounded by happy attractive people</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.799" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">and with that I&#39;ve never seen that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.959" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">the bar in my life and everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not true and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">because right away right you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">well I know that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">but you&#39;re actually losing in that game</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.829" style="s2">because now you&#39;re indifferent to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s true and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.829" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">that matters is right the alcohol has</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">been made salient to you by its</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:50.220" style="s2">association with sexuality success and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">you go out and buy the alcohol that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.220" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">precisely why the advertisers for all</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:57.510" style="s2">the money in now that&#39;s a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">instance of because you&#39;re made</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.510" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">indifferent to the truth and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:04.139" style="s2">caught up in sailing now why does that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:06.060" style="s2">relevant to self-deception and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.139" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">where I think it might tie in with</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.060" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">Jordans distinction I take it that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">can&#39;t and there&#39;s a lot of philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">who argue about this and I think many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">them come to the similar conclusion you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">can&#39;t really lie to yourself you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">say well I know Susan doesn&#39;t love me</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">but I&#39;ll say it and you know because</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:26.640" style="s2">saying something to yourself is it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:27.570" style="s2">same thing as believing it believing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.640" end="00:04:29.820" style="s2">not something you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.570" end="00:04:31.860" style="s2">as an active will you can desire you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.820" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">hope you can will but you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.860" end="00:04:38.370" style="s2">sort of make yourself believe and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:40.200" style="s2">that&#39;s important because then the common</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.370" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">metaphor we have would sort of situate</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.200" end="00:04:45.480" style="s2">us at the propositional level I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">incorrectly for self deception is we lie</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.480" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">to ourselves whereas I think what we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">is ourselves because well we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.070" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">can&#39;t directly manipulate belief what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">can directly manipulate with our</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:59.790" style="s2">attention is salience I can make</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:02.490" style="s2">something salient to you just by getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.790" end="00:05:04.140" style="s2">you to attend to it like you know how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.490" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">your right hand doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.140" end="00:05:08.190" style="s2">now what&#39;s salient to you it stands out</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:09.240" style="s2">for you it gets your attention but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.190" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">trick the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:13.290" style="s2">attention is it&#39;s not only something we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">direct it&#39;s something that grabs us so</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.290" end="00:05:18.840" style="s2">also salient for you it grabs your</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:20.850" style="s2">attention and so attention as this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">self-organizing capacity which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.850" end="00:05:26.070" style="s2">tremendously adaptive but it also makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">it liable in this following fashion</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.070" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">you know the advertiser directs your</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:32.640" style="s2">attention towards the alcohol in these</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">other stimuli that makes the alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.640" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">more salient to you that&#39;s gonna catch</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">your attention more often which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:41.010" style="s2">more salient to and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">deceived and you can do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.010" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">with yourself you can deceive yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">by getting a walk by not paying</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:49.110" style="s2">attention to how you&#39;re paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:50.750" style="s2">you can get caught up in this Dilla</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.110" end="00:05:53.160" style="s2">Terius</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:05:55.650" style="s2">self-organization of your attention that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.160" end="00:05:59.690" style="s2">gets you caught in this sort of salient</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.650" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">spiral and that leads you to have your</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.690" end="00:06:05.730" style="s2">behavior directed in a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.610" end="00:06:08.250" style="s2">salience of the information is being</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.730" end="00:06:11.160" style="s2">disconnected from your evaluation of its</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.250" end="00:06:14.630" style="s2">truth its realness its moral goodness</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.160" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">etc and I find that this is a pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.630" end="00:06:19.710" style="s2">pattern in a lot of people&#39;s cognition I</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">think when you&#39;re looking into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.710" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">what therapists are working with they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:26.730" style="s2">often trying to break out of salience</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">misdirection oh just teach talk to him</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.730" end="00:06:31.350" style="s2">one more minute I think that&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">Jordan a lot to work with so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.350" end="00:06:34.890" style="s2">things I talk about when people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:36.660" style="s2">doing therapeutic work is aspect</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.890" end="00:06:39.390" style="s2">disguise so here&#39;s a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.660" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">example somebody comes in to therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.390" end="00:06:42.630" style="s2">they know oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:44.669" style="s2">have a problem I&#39;m too stubborn</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.630" end="00:06:47.009" style="s2">everybody says I&#39;m too stubborn I got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.669" end="00:06:48.870" style="s2">change my stubbornness and the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.009" end="00:06:51.990" style="s2">is okay and then you talk off you go</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.870" end="00:06:53.250" style="s2">away and and you come around and you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.990" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">tell me something you really like about</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.250" end="00:06:57.539" style="s2">yourself like you really identify with</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.080" end="00:06:59.669" style="s2">it oh I&#39;m really persistent I stick with</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.539" end="00:07:02.759" style="s2">things and I keep going no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.669" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s like mmm so what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.759" end="00:07:06.419" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:08.669" style="s2">about the same thing without realizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.419" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">it because they&#39;re changing the salience</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.669" end="00:07:13.530" style="s2">of this particular mental feature right</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.150" style="s2">and when they when they&#39;re seeking help</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.530" end="00:07:17.550" style="s2">they&#39;re picking up on the naked are</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.150" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">making salient the negative features but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:21.180" style="s2">when they&#39;re identifying right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.550" style="s2">picking up on the positive features and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.180" end="00:07:25.530" style="s2">so they themselves in that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.550" end="00:07:27.479" style="s2">and so I&#39;m trying to give a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.530" end="00:07:29.099" style="s2">very concrete examples for you to work</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.479" end="00:07:30.599" style="s2">with Jordan that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.099" end="00:07:32.430" style="s2">bullshitting yourself and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.599" end="00:07:34.380" style="s2">working at this attentional level and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.430" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">the level at which were sort of creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.380" end="00:07:45.300" style="s2">our identities in our interactions</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:46.409" style="s2">wow that&#39;s great that was I have felt as</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.300" end="00:07:47.699" style="s2">we went through that actually for there</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.409" end="00:07:48.120" style="s2">was a journey and just that little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.699" end="00:07:51.659" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.120" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">setting up the larger story my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.659" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">that there&#39;s actually something very</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:57.930" style="s2">interesting to be found here the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:08:02.690" style="s2">physical shape of it it almost feels</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.930" end="00:08:07.580" style="s2">like a like a particular geometry</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.690" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">I noticed I&#39;m actually a little bit a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.580" end="00:08:12.990" style="s2">little bit of bashed it feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:16.169" style="s2">maybe more than I feel that at least I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.990" end="00:08:18.030" style="s2">person can Congrats but I&#39;m also excited</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">to see if by venturing in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.030" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">something actually emerges between us</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:24.289" style="s2">which would be wonderful good and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:26.460" style="s2">expect that if it does it&#39;ll be largely</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.289" end="00:08:30.360" style="s2">because you were here because this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.460" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">definitely a place where well you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.360" end="00:08:35.130" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:37.260" style="s2">punching vigorously in the direction so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.130" end="00:08:40.919" style="s2">the distinction that I tried to make in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.260" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">this concept simulated thinking and just</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.919" end="00:08:46.079" style="s2">real thinking action was based in the in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">the in the in the conversation or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.079" end="00:08:52.470" style="s2">way that I expressed it on a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">foundational distinction between habit</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.470" end="00:08:57.750" style="s2">mode and explore mode</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:09:00.150" style="s2">and so the notion is that there&#39;s an in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.750" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">normal thinking there&#39;s a fluid</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.150" end="00:09:06.120" style="s2">relationship between habit mode and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:10.340" style="s2">explore mode where those those aspects</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.120" end="00:09:13.980" style="s2">of life that are most they can be I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.340" end="00:09:15.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t recognize as being more or less</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.980" end="00:09:17.580" style="s2">identical to circumstances that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.960" end="00:09:20.520" style="s2">dealt with in the past and therefore can</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.580" end="00:09:23.190" style="s2">be addressed effectively using well-worn</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.520" end="00:09:25.470" style="s2">habits are the appropriate domain of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.190" end="00:09:29.280" style="s2">habit mode I&#39;ve actually learned that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.470" end="00:09:30.960" style="s2">apparently Brits notice that Americans</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.280" end="00:09:33.720" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been driving more and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.960" end="00:09:35.570" style="s2">longer drive and haven&#39;t moved in with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:39.330" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a little bit frightening</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.570" end="00:09:40.770" style="s2">right okay talk and think while driving</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.330" end="00:09:43.380" style="s2">in a way that isn&#39;t ordinary for them</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.770" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">right right and then of course we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.380" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">Explorer mode where we&#39;re were quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">specific</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:10:00.900" style="s2">acting but rather are moving more slowly</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.170" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">through experience and paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.900" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">in a more open-ended way seeking</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">be arising for which to respond this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.000" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">ordinary thinking and the notion that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:18.330" style="s2">propose that there&#39;s this kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:22.200" style="s2">Eddy that can enter into when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.330" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">particular form of habit mode that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.200" end="00:10:28.970" style="s2">presents itself as being seeking mode</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">and then begins the process of eating</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.970" end="00:10:33.420" style="s2">the normal fluid relationships that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">find ourselves in habit mode and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.420" end="00:10:36.690" style="s2">thinking that we&#39;re thinking normally</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:39.840" style="s2">and now we&#39;re najran simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.690" end="00:10:42.600" style="s2">oh let me let me see if I can point it</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.840" end="00:10:44.370" style="s2">to some specific cognitive mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:46.770" style="s2">that I wear of it I think they fit into</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.370" end="00:10:51.090" style="s2">the model you just put so let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.770" end="00:10:53.100" style="s2">good example of simulated thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.090" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">which habit thinking I&#39;m trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.100" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">your terms carefully here is being</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">extended into what looks like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.090" style="s2">exploration but isn&#39;t would be something</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">like the confirmation bias the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.090" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">confirmation bias is you look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:05.490" style="s2">you&#39;re exploring but you&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.900" end="00:11:07.020" style="s2">exploring because you&#39;re only looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.490" end="00:11:08.460" style="s2">for information that will already</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.020" end="00:11:09.840" style="s2">confirm your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.460" end="00:11:12.090" style="s2">don&#39;t look for any information that will</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.840" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">actually challenge it so while it looks</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.090" end="00:11:17.430" style="s2">like you&#39;re doing research or exploring</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:20.250" style="s2">you&#39;re actually not doing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.430" end="00:11:21.780" style="s2">actually just reinforcing the beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.250" end="00:11:23.940" style="s2">you have because you&#39;re falling prey to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.780" end="00:11:25.380" style="s2">the confirmation bias and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.940" end="00:11:28.080" style="s2">this is one of the things that drives</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.380" end="00:11:31.710" style="s2">echo-chamber II in social media it just</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.080" end="00:11:34.830" style="s2">reinforces it very very quickly and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.710" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">strikes me as a good instance of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.830" end="00:11:38.970" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about because of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:41.580" style="s2">you should look for confirmation when</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.970" end="00:11:43.080" style="s2">you&#39;re doing exploration but right but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.580" end="00:11:45.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a bias precisely because it only</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.080" end="00:11:48.090" style="s2">makes the confirming evidence salient</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.510" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">and you don&#39;t direct attention towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.090" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">something that might dis confirm your</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">belief and so that&#39;s a prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:55.640" style="s2">incidence of bullshitting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.920" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">and so the confirmation bias would be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.640" end="00:12:00.120" style="s2">lynchpin between sort of habit thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.350" end="00:12:01.980" style="s2">pretending to be exploratory thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.120" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">that is also quintessentially an</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.980" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">instance of are you familiar</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">work and the Tainter curve you know all</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:15.050" style="s2">right this is this I think this is going</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:19.650" style="s2">to be badass all right check this out so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.050" end="00:12:21.330" style="s2">painters work is anthropological so he</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.650" end="00:12:22.950" style="s2">takes a look at the book the big book</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.330" end="00:12:25.580" style="s2">the main book is the the collapse of</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.520" end="00:12:42.930" style="s2">okay go ahead on the top 5 top 5 list so</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.550" end="00:12:46.110" style="s2">spoiler alert but the the proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.930" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">here is that in the context of a society</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.110" end="00:12:49.350" style="s2">so a group of people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">together and communicating with each</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.350" end="00:12:55.620" style="s2">other and building an increasingly</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.560" end="00:13:12.330" style="s2">like that bronze in the bronze age food</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.570" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">corn in there and the Mayan Empire right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.330" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">right and what and what you see is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s actually it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">to suss out because it&#39;s there&#39;s two</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:26.730" style="s2">happen had simultaneous and his curves</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.180" end="00:13:29.880" style="s2">are superimposed on each other so one</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.730" end="00:13:31.890" style="s2">has to do with a series of what are now</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.880" end="00:13:33.330" style="s2">pretty well understood s curves that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">associated with what happens when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.330" end="00:13:38.660" style="s2">engaging in innovation</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:41.940" style="s2">so innovation has a characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.660" end="00:13:45.270" style="s2">exploring for a while with little upside</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.940" end="00:13:46.890" style="s2">until it hits some set of structures</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.270" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2">that seem to work and then it exploits</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.890" end="00:13:49.470" style="s2">those structures and you get an</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:51.780" style="s2">acceleration and then you could have</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.470" end="00:13:54.710" style="s2">tapped out everything that you can and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.780" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">kind of come to the top of the S curve</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.710" end="00:13:58.290" style="s2">you get the exact same curve in</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:02.640" style="s2">psychology when you&#39;re studying insight</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.290" end="00:14:03.960" style="s2">problem-solving mmm well and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.640" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">guessing for the same reason actually I</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.960" end="00:14:08.700" style="s2">guess it is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:11.790" style="s2">fundamental about the nature of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.700" end="00:14:15.450" style="s2">particular mode of being in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.790" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2">with reality sure yeah you were you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.450" end="00:14:19.380" style="s2">proposing an isomorphism that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:21.930" style="s2">we&#39;re exploring yeah yeah exactly and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.380" end="00:14:24.090" style="s2">awesome okay so so in the tape thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.930" end="00:14:27.720" style="s2">what you have is on the one hand you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.090" end="00:14:29.310" style="s2">got that dynamic so in the beginning you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.720" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">have I start and then on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.310" end="00:14:34.080" style="s2">you have the dynamic of the some</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:37.460" style="s2">relatively increasing difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.080" end="00:14:42.150" style="s2">getting access to the resource under the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.460" end="00:14:43.290" style="s2">low-hanging fruit in the beginning while</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.150" end="00:14:45.630" style="s2">you&#39;re technology for extracting</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.290" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">petroleum really sucks petroleum is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.630" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">relatively easy to get right so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.390" end="00:14:53.070" style="s2">got like X capacity and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:54.900" style="s2">increase your technology and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.070" end="00:14:56.610" style="s2">petroleum is still relatively easy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.900" end="00:14:59.010" style="s2">get she actually get a significant</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:15:00.690" style="s2">increase on X but then you&#39;ve harvested</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.010" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">all the low-hanging fruit and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.690" end="00:15:04.200" style="s2">noticing is that it&#39;s harder to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:05.580" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually getting all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.200" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">low-hanging fruits your technology has</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.580" end="00:15:09.570" style="s2">to get better to keep on but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:11.640" style="s2">still got a lot of room in improvement</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.570" end="00:15:12.870" style="s2">of technology so your technology does</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.640" end="00:15:13.770" style="s2">keep in it right it gets a lot better so</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.870" end="00:15:15.510" style="s2">you don&#39;t just keep up you actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.770" end="00:15:18.180" style="s2">accelerate so you see this acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.510" end="00:15:21.300" style="s2">curve right but what that happening is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.180" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">as you begin to move up the s-curve in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.300" end="00:15:24.390" style="s2">technology you&#39;re also beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">cross</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.390" end="00:15:29.100" style="s2">what is a obviously it very much depends</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">on the particular it is the resource but</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.100" end="00:15:32.640" style="s2">a different kind of curve that tends to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:36.180" style="s2">have a depletion characteristic on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.640" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">resource right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.180" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">and you&#39;re also taking the resource and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.480" end="00:15:44.400" style="s2">making it more and more fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">the society itself this is the that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.400" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">third piece is crucial so you you get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:53.000" style="s2">a point where you actually find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:56.100" style="s2">not just kind of liking or enjoying or</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.000" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">be rewarded by investments in technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.100" end="00:16:00.450" style="s2">you&#39;re certainly in the red Queens race</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">we actually have your must continue to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:04.529" style="s2">actually increase your investment in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:06.600" style="s2">technology just to keep pace but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.529" end="00:16:09.330" style="s2">still actually getting a positive return</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.600" end="00:16:10.890" style="s2">on investment in in in Rd because</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.330" end="00:16:12.210" style="s2">there&#39;s still plenty of resource to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.890" end="00:16:14.040" style="s2">there&#39;s still plenty of room in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.210" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">technology curve but you hit a certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.040" end="00:16:20.400" style="s2">inflection point where you&#39;ve moved from</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:23.670" style="s2">a highly very fluid seeking optionality</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.400" end="00:16:25.140" style="s2">to a oh wait now the society if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.670" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">start to slow down what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.140" end="00:16:29.370" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna feel the pinch at the social</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:33.140" style="s2">level we&#39;re gonna feel an unpleasantness</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.370" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">as the from the neurological level the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.140" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">serotonin does not continue to flow</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.930" style="s2">right but then you start getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">yourself into a real problem because as</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.930" end="00:16:45.750" style="s2">the technology begins to move through</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:48.060" style="s2">the curve you&#39;re actually now having to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.750" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">increase the the amount of investment</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.060" end="00:16:52.709" style="s2">just to continue to stay at pay so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve moved from an acceleration mode</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.709" end="00:16:56.820" style="s2">in in the fundamental curve to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.170" end="00:16:58.860" style="s2">velocity mode so acceleration is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.820" end="00:17:00.060" style="s2">actually decreasing velocities continue</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.860" end="00:17:01.470" style="s2">to increase so it still feels like</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.060" end="00:17:04.380" style="s2">you&#39;re getting a positive ROI in fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.470" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">you are but the acceleration is slowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.380" end="00:17:07.559" style="s2">down and this is where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:09.630" style="s2">teachers model where you hit the key</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.559" end="00:17:13.319" style="s2">pivot point like right here is the point</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.630" end="00:17:17.579" style="s2">where society could shift like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.319" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">like you know 1975-1977 in oil and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.579" end="00:17:22.140" style="s2">America were like okay now we&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">concerted effort to move consciously to</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.140" end="00:17:28.410" style="s2">a different infrastructure we still have</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:30.809" style="s2">enough resource and enough runway in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.410" end="00:17:32.580" style="s2">technology in innovation space and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.809" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">still not so fully addicted to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.580" end="00:17:37.110" style="s2">resource that pivoting from an oil based</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:39.330" style="s2">economy to an electronic tricity based</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.110" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">economy while painful is quite doable</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.330" end="00:17:44.970" style="s2">but generally speaking and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:46.770" style="s2">the the similarity really rain from</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.970" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">you&#39;re generally speaking you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.770" end="00:17:50.100" style="s2">generally speaking the cost of changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">your mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.100" end="00:17:55.170" style="s2">and the ability to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:57.750" style="s2">into continuing down this road causes</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.170" end="00:18:00.120" style="s2">you not to almost ever as a society make</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.750" end="00:18:02.220" style="s2">the choice to switch at that point then</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.120" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">you get yourself into the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.220" end="00:18:07.410" style="s2">curve where now the technology is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">beginning to show less and less return</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.410" end="00:18:13.860" style="s2">so now we&#39;re past oil derricks in the in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">the oceans in the 60s and 70s now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.860" end="00:18:16.230" style="s2">starting to get into the deepwater</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">horizon where you&#39;re actually having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.230" end="00:18:21.690" style="s2">real crazy deep to get returning or</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:22.950" style="s2">fracking to be able to and the resource</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.690" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">is now getting to the point where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.950" end="00:18:26.970" style="s2">on the other side of the Hubble curve in</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.930" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">oil and you&#39;re actually getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.970" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">depleting the resources are now getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:34.830" style="s2">past there the peak um so you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">to really scramble the technology is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.830" end="00:18:39.810" style="s2">incredible just to keep pace and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.270" style="s2">you&#39;re really locked into something</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.810" end="00:18:43.890" style="s2">because the society has now made not</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.270" end="00:18:45.750" style="s2">just an investment in oil it&#39;s made a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.890" end="00:18:47.640" style="s2">massive investment in the capacity like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.750" end="00:18:49.380" style="s2">think about how how deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.640" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">intertwine and while you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.380" end="00:18:52.830" style="s2">think about this from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">and neurological level right how deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.830" end="00:18:57.210" style="s2">intertwined things are like how the</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:11.880" style="s2">gasoline I mean this hugely complicated</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.780" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">fabric of a massive commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.880" end="00:19:15.750" style="s2">something that is now in the tantrum</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:18.180" style="s2">story reaching a point where it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.750" end="00:19:19.260" style="s2">longer sustainable and you hear a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.180" end="00:19:22.500" style="s2">through one of multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.260" end="00:19:25.500" style="s2">pathways so then just take that same</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.500" end="00:19:27.930" style="s2">exact story and we map it to the story</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.500" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">of and simulated thinking so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.930" end="00:19:32.940" style="s2">have a in simulated thinking what I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">is I have an a reasonably optimized</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.940" end="00:19:40.140" style="s2">habit structure able to respond to life</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:42.390" style="s2">in some rapid and at least initially</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.140" end="00:19:44.270" style="s2">perhaps very effective way like at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.390" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">store that I like to use is just math</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.270" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">right if the way we teach kids math</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:52.710" style="s2">particularly arithmetic is through habit</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:55.140" style="s2">mode right</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.710" end="00:19:56.760" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t intelligent my early 30s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.140" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">before I actually grasp even</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">multiplication but I can multiply when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.300" style="s2">can be a calculator yeah but I could not</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:04.190" style="s2">I didn&#39;t understand what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.300" end="00:20:07.410" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.190" end="00:20:09.150" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been given this tool that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.410" end="00:20:11.010" style="s2">very effective by the way I can build</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.150" end="00:20:13.050" style="s2">more on I can actually do physics on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.010" end="00:20:14.100" style="s2">basis of my capacity to be a calculator</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.050" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">even though I still don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.100" end="00:20:17.340" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening sure I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:18.540" style="s2">build more and more on this</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.340" end="00:20:21.809" style="s2">infrastructure and it&#39;s based on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.540" end="00:20:24.150" style="s2">certain ability of every individual</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.809" end="00:20:25.620" style="s2">human having a certain capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.150" end="00:20:28.040" style="s2">certain things with a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:31.410" style="s2">precision and a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.040" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">reliability of repeatability and I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.410" end="00:20:37.140" style="s2">build more and more social fabric on top</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">of that sure okay sorry that&#39;s I am</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.140" end="00:20:41.940" style="s2">there there&#39;s more but that&#39;s right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:48.870" style="s2">just ready to tail off okay so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.940" end="00:20:51.890" style="s2">is then that let me see I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.870" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">explain back what I what I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.890" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">right so the idea is that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">something that is initially very</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">adaptive and it&#39;s being used and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.309" style="s2">sort of automatic that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:04.710" style="s2">automatic thinking right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.309" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">precisely because of its activity and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.710" end="00:21:11.160" style="s2">then you know you you build more and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.850" end="00:21:13.830" style="s2">more on top of that foundation the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.160" end="00:21:15.240" style="s2">more and more of American culture and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.830" end="00:21:18.990" style="s2">industry was built on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.240" end="00:21:21.350" style="s2">petroleum right but as you get more and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.990" end="00:21:24.450" style="s2">more committed to it its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.350" end="00:21:27.030" style="s2">extract reward from the environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.450" end="00:21:29.340" style="s2">starts to decrease because the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.030" end="00:21:31.710" style="s2">right has limited resources it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.340" end="00:21:33.900" style="s2">dynamically changing and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.710" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">invest more and more in getting what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.900" end="00:21:38.670" style="s2">used to get from it and then the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.500" style="s2">at some point right something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.670" end="00:21:42.450" style="s2">diminishing returns sets in and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.500" end="00:21:44.280" style="s2">you&#39;re into a situation where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.450" end="00:21:46.410" style="s2">sort of catastrophic lis committed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.280" end="00:21:48.600" style="s2">something that is ultimately doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.410" end="00:21:51.540" style="s2">fail is that the is that the model that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.600" end="00:21:52.890" style="s2">right do I have it right yeah the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.540" end="00:21:54.179" style="s2">I would want to make sure it&#39;s all in</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.890" end="00:21:56.900" style="s2">there is when you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.179" end="00:21:59.580" style="s2">automated I would also put in optimize</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.900" end="00:22:01.470" style="s2">sure there&#39;s something fundamental out</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.580" end="00:22:03.540" style="s2">the notion of optimization that I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.470" end="00:22:08.760" style="s2">is key to the key to the story give you</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.540" end="00:22:10.830" style="s2">the model so well let me make sure I use</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.760" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">this word the same way you do I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.830" end="00:22:14.520" style="s2">there&#39;s two senses of optimize there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">there&#39;s local optimization right which</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.520" end="00:22:19.140" style="s2">is I&#39;m optimized in this context and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:21.330" style="s2">there&#39;s law there&#39;s longitudinal</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.140" end="00:22:22.590" style="s2">optimization in which what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.330" end="00:22:24.330" style="s2">is I want to play the meta game of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.590" end="00:22:28.740" style="s2">keeping open my ability to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.330" end="00:22:30.870" style="s2">across new context right this this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.740" end="00:22:33.000" style="s2">like the difference between that I being</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.870" end="00:22:35.130" style="s2">merely logical and then trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.000" end="00:22:37.650" style="s2">comprehensively rational in one&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.130" end="00:22:42.390" style="s2">yeah great and without that would say is</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.650" end="00:22:45.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the former yeah yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.390" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">the line it&#39;s an effort to simulate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.090" end="00:22:50.280" style="s2">latter by virtue of a limit as X limit</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:51.930" style="s2">as the former approaches the latter and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.280" end="00:22:52.500" style="s2">that I think is where things get really</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.930" end="00:22:56.730" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.500" end="00:22:59.240" style="s2">so is that so when you equivocate then</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.730" end="00:23:01.770" style="s2">I&#39;d like like you have you ever calculus</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.240" end="00:23:04.170" style="s2">analogy as a form of equivocation but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.770" end="00:23:06.330" style="s2">when you equivocate between actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.170" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">pursuing their meta optimality and just</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:10.200" style="s2">folding something into whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">automated system you&#39;re using that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.200" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">moment of is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">see now right you&#39;re identifying two</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">things that are exactly not identical in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:20.940" style="s2">the important way in that one has the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:23.490" style="s2">option of renewing your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.940" end="00:23:25.980" style="s2">exploration and innovation right and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.490" end="00:23:27.480" style="s2">other has precisely that the the effect</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.980" end="00:23:32.160" style="s2">of keeping you inside your confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.480" end="00:23:34.050" style="s2">bias keeping you inside the the habitual</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.160" end="00:23:37.260" style="s2">mode of thinking is that is that correct</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.050" end="00:23:43.320" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s it well that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.260" end="00:23:47.340" style="s2">interesting that so that that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.320" end="00:23:49.260" style="s2">we can make a bridge here because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.340" end="00:23:50.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you are where you are in</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.260" end="00:23:52.820" style="s2">the series but I talked in the series</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.670" end="00:23:58.290" style="s2">about mark Lewis&#39;s model of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.820" end="00:24:02.160" style="s2">and he talks about it as a process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.290" end="00:24:04.530" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and let me see if</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.160" end="00:24:06.840" style="s2">this works it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.530" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">isomorphic but I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.840" end="00:24:12.410" style="s2">here we can we can make a bridge so he</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">talked about wanting to undercut the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.410" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">normal model of addiction which is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:18.360" style="s2">the model of the disease model I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:20.190" style="s2">this foreign substance in me and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.360" end="00:24:21.450" style="s2">just compelling me to behave and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.190" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">problem with the disease model is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.450" end="00:24:24.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t situate well with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:28.290" style="s2">actual empirical data if a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.930" end="00:24:30.719" style="s2">will spontaneously stop their addiction</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.290" end="00:24:32.849" style="s2">just because the age for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.719" end="00:24:34.829" style="s2">we have people like you know the Vietnam</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.849" end="00:24:36.359" style="s2">soldiers that seem to be addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.829" end="00:24:38.279" style="s2">heroin when they&#39;re in Nam but when they</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.359" end="00:24:40.529" style="s2">return they just spontaneously give up</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.279" end="00:24:42.959" style="s2">right and so the disease model doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.529" end="00:24:45.989" style="s2">work very well and he&#39;s not the model</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.959" end="00:24:48.389" style="s2">that looks like this the model is right</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.989" end="00:24:50.759" style="s2">well what happens is I I take the drug</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.389" end="00:24:52.469" style="s2">and that sort of hampers a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.759" end="00:24:54.809" style="s2">my cognitive flexibility in ways and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.469" end="00:24:56.129" style="s2">what that does is that alters well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.809" end="00:24:57.659" style="s2">use a little bit of my language just to</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.129" end="00:24:59.909" style="s2">speed things up it alters what I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.659" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">notice and pay attention to so my world</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.909" end="00:25:04.469" style="s2">the options in my world shut down a bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:07.829" style="s2">and then as the options in my world shut</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.469" end="00:25:12.359" style="s2">down instead of breaking I sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.829" end="00:25:13.799" style="s2">Baldauf I commit to this world to some</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.359" end="00:25:15.659" style="s2">degree and what that does is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.799" end="00:25:17.729" style="s2">commitment actually then reduces my</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.659" end="00:25:19.409" style="s2">cognitive flexibility right and now you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.729" end="00:25:21.929" style="s2">got a feedback loop as my cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.409" end="00:25:24.059" style="s2">flexibility goes down my flex is what my</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.929" end="00:25:25.739" style="s2">world gets less and less so you get what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.059" end="00:25:28.289" style="s2">he calls reciprocal narrowing until</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.739" end="00:25:31.079" style="s2">eventually I can&#39;t be any different than</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.289" end="00:25:33.149" style="s2">I am and I see no other options in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.079" end="00:25:35.759" style="s2">world and then that&#39;s what addiction is</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.149" end="00:25:38.669" style="s2">when I&#39;d lost any ability to change my</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.759" end="00:25:40.499" style="s2">identity and I see no other alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.669" end="00:25:42.089" style="s2">in the world and that seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.499" end="00:25:43.949" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing like with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.089" end="00:25:46.649" style="s2">American and culture with like with</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.949" end="00:25:48.389" style="s2">petroleum there&#39;s just our identities as</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.649" end="00:25:50.489" style="s2">petroleum consumers there&#39;s no other way</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.389" end="00:25:52.499" style="s2">we can be right and there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.489" end="00:25:54.539" style="s2">option for us we like and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.499" end="00:25:56.549" style="s2">thing with people in the Bronze Age or</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.539" end="00:25:58.709" style="s2">the Mayans with the maize right is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.549" end="00:26:01.319" style="s2">well this is who we are and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.709" end="00:26:02.669" style="s2">the only way for us is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.319" end="00:26:06.029" style="s2">talking about because that&#39;s very how</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.669" end="00:26:09.299" style="s2">much sort of like I mean in March I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.029" end="00:26:11.309" style="s2">I I know mark personally his colleague</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.299" end="00:26:12.629" style="s2">and friend I think he&#39;s I think I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.309" end="00:26:14.309" style="s2">think he&#39;s brilliant I think the work</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.629" end="00:26:16.409" style="s2">he&#39;s doing on addiction is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.309" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">pivotal but I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.409" end="00:26:20.879" style="s2">connection is right then because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:24.690" style="s2">exactly a kind of right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.879" end="00:26:26.249" style="s2">where what you&#39;re finding Syria is right</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.690" end="00:26:29.129" style="s2">affecting how you&#39;re coupled to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.249" end="00:26:32.639" style="s2">world and then right then that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.129" end="00:26:35.429" style="s2">impacts on what identities you can take</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.639" end="00:26:37.649" style="s2">what force of development you can go</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.429" end="00:26:44.370" style="s2">through and then it just narrows all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.649" end="00:26:45.420" style="s2">way down so are you are you proposing</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.370" end="00:26:48.900" style="s2">it sounds to me like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.420" end="00:26:51.210" style="s2">proposing is that something like that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.900" end="00:26:53.880" style="s2">happening in the individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.210" end="00:26:57.500" style="s2">getting caught up in simulated thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.880" end="00:27:02.940" style="s2">they&#39;re basically right there they they</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.500" end="00:27:04.200" style="s2">they look like they&#39;re exploring but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.940" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">actually what they&#39;re doing is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.200" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">process of intensifying the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:14.309" style="s2">narrowing between who they are and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:18.390" style="s2">their world can be mm-hmm yeah is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.309" end="00:27:20.210" style="s2">does that feels very nice okay good that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.390" end="00:27:23.400" style="s2">feels that feels very right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.210" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a something very large like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.400" end="00:27:28.140" style="s2">large synthesis that is kind of waiting</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">at the wings I can kind of seal it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.140" end="00:27:35.250" style="s2">around the periphery me too maybe too</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:38.070" style="s2">large again but yeah this is good what</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.250" end="00:27:42.510" style="s2">the reason that&#39;s in for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.070" end="00:27:44.760" style="s2">because you know please no I was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.510" end="00:27:47.820" style="s2">gonna say that that that brings an</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.760" end="00:27:49.770" style="s2">opportunity to make a potential</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.820" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">connection that I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.770" end="00:27:56.580" style="s2">relevant to your notion of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">were talking about this this open</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.580" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">exploratory thing and sort of how much</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">we can hold I mean I proposed this to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">mark directly because I proposed to him</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:10.410" style="s2">well the possibility the actuality</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:12.780" style="s2">because we have if this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.410" end="00:28:15.900" style="s2">account of addiction the actuality of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.780" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing also needs there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.900" end="00:28:20.400" style="s2">a real potential for the opposite which</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:24.660" style="s2">is reciprocal opening reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.400" end="00:28:27.059" style="s2">realization right we&#39;re you know and I I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.660" end="00:28:30.210" style="s2">see this in plato&#39;s model of an agog a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.059" end="00:28:32.520" style="s2">right i I get more flexible than the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.210" end="00:28:35.340" style="s2">identities i can assume and that allows</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.520" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">me to explore the world more deeply as I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.340" end="00:28:39.900" style="s2">explore the world more deeply that adds</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.080" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">a flexibility to my cognitive grammar I</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.900" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">then write so you can see the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:46.679" style="s2">you could reciprocally old then as</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:48.840" style="s2">opposed to reciprocally narrowing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:52.140" style="s2">the reason why I bring that up is I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:55.020" style="s2">think what you are trying to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.140" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">kinds of discourse I see you practicing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.020" end="00:28:59.700" style="s2">is exactly that I think you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:02.650" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing to you the following I</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.700" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">propose to you that in order to deal</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.650" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">with this the reciprocal narrowing of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:09.220" style="s2">simulated thinking you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:14.230" style="s2">enact the opposite you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.220" end="00:29:18.220" style="s2">enact the reciprocal opening what do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.230" end="00:29:19.510" style="s2">think of that yeah definitely yeah are</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.220" end="00:29:21.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.510" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">unfortunately I can&#39;t remember the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.040" end="00:29:26.140" style="s2">citation of the the woman whose theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:29.100" style="s2">this this is but there was a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.140" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">who was building from theory around</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.100" end="00:29:41.559" style="s2">explaining complex systems she was</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:42.250" style="s2">discussing the new no keep going yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.559" end="00:29:46.870" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.250" end="00:29:49.450" style="s2">exactly yeah pereira yeah the the notion</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.870" end="00:29:52.510" style="s2">of enabling constraints in how wholes</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.450" end="00:29:54.190" style="s2">have yeah yep and and it feel that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.510" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship between enabling</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.190" end="00:30:00.010" style="s2">constraints or contextual constraints</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:04.260" style="s2">and these reciprocal narrowing where</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.010" end="00:30:06.970" style="s2">there&#39;s some some structure whereby</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.260" end="00:30:09.300" style="s2">there&#39;s some relationship there yes the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.970" end="00:30:12.130" style="s2">the place you&#39;re pointing is very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.300" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">in the right direction and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.130" end="00:30:20.230" style="s2">that there&#39;s a no as its it the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:22.360" style="s2">point the key point that you made</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.230" end="00:30:27.570" style="s2">earlier about the distinction between a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.360" end="00:30:29.290" style="s2">local optimization and a more open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.570" end="00:30:32.250" style="s2">organization of fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.290" end="00:30:40.470" style="s2">ontologically open-ended optimization it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.250" end="00:30:40.470" style="s2">needs to be held very centrally as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.620" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">proposition in the way that we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:53.890" style="s2">reality right I think you intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:56.490" style="s2">all the frame you yeah I was gonna say I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.890" end="00:30:59.020" style="s2">think that&#39;s really really cool because</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:02.230" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s just resonating with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.020" end="00:31:03.910" style="s2">right now a lot around Plato because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.230" end="00:31:05.530" style="s2">distinction between Plato and Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.910" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">as many people have explained it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.530" end="00:31:10.540" style="s2">their attitude towards wonder Plato is</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:11.410" style="s2">trying to ultimately expand wonder into</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.540" end="00:31:14.260" style="s2">awe</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.410" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">right and whereas Aristotle thinks of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.260" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">wonder as something that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:21.100" style="s2">remove he identifies it too much with</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:23.160" style="s2">curiosity right he wants to remove it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.100" end="00:31:29.260" style="s2">through the acquisition of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.160" end="00:31:32.680" style="s2">mm-hmm there&#39;s a lot of Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.260" end="00:31:34.750" style="s2">around for very good reason right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.680" end="00:31:37.810" style="s2">the foundational figure of science in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.750" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">lot of ways I empathize with that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.810" end="00:31:43.090" style="s2">empathize that a lot like I&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:45.420" style="s2">with him the Gilchrist&#39;s work yes of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.090" end="00:31:49.450" style="s2">course I mean I&#39;ve talked about it in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.420" end="00:31:52.630" style="s2">the courses when I talk about brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.450" end="00:31:56.290" style="s2">lateralization and I&#39;ve read also the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.630" end="00:32:00.750" style="s2">follow-up essay on the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.290" end="00:32:03.550" style="s2">interaction between his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:05.200" style="s2">hemispheric asymmetry and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.550" end="00:32:08.170" style="s2">something he&#39;s articulating as the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:10.510" style="s2">meaning crisis and so he thought that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.170" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">that mapped on very well to your your</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.510" end="00:32:18.390" style="s2">definition of Aristotle and Plato is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:20.920" style="s2">almost sounds like the sort of ya know</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.390" end="00:32:23.620" style="s2">deeply deeply because the the left</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.920" end="00:32:24.910" style="s2">hemisphere I mean so the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.620" end="00:32:26.680" style="s2">is basically how you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.910" end="00:32:28.630" style="s2">well-defined problems which fits in very</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.680" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">well with a lot of what Jordans talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.630" end="00:32:33.580" style="s2">about just so cleanly right and when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.950" style="s2">in well-defined problems what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.580" end="00:32:38.440" style="s2">you know I want attention to detail I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.950" end="00:32:40.570" style="s2">pursuing certainty and clarity at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.440" end="00:32:42.250" style="s2">cost because right when we&#39;re both in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.570" end="00:32:44.650" style="s2">familiar context if I can get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.250" end="00:32:47.020" style="s2">details all beat you because we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.650" end="00:32:49.090" style="s2">familiar with the context right and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.020" end="00:32:50.680" style="s2">and I went step by step processing</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.090" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">because the more I have step by step</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.680" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">processing the more fine-grained I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:55.540" style="s2">make my behavior right and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:32:58.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the left hemisphere and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.540" end="00:33:00.490" style="s2">great the problem is you face a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.540" end="00:33:03.310" style="s2">ill-defined problems in your life like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.490" end="00:33:04.660" style="s2">predation right right when you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.310" end="00:33:05.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know where it&#39;s coming from you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.660" end="00:33:07.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.770" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">predator it&#39;s gonna be and so the right</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.330" end="00:33:12.430" style="s2">hemisphere sort of evolves for you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.050" style="s2">grabbing the default and it&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.430" end="00:33:17.080" style="s2">more tolerant of ambiguity because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.050" end="00:33:18.790" style="s2">care too deeply which kind of predator</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.080" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2">it is you know it&#39;s bigger moving</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.790" end="00:33:23.850" style="s2">towards you get away from it it&#39;s faster</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.350" end="00:33:25.920" style="s2">yeah right and and so but</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.850" end="00:33:27.570" style="s2">interesting right what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.920" end="00:33:31.290" style="s2">when you&#39;re watching and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.570" end="00:33:34.050" style="s2">work of Bowman and Beaman and others</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.290" end="00:33:35.280" style="s2">right on in sight what you can see in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.050" end="00:33:37.110" style="s2">lot of people when they have a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.280" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">insight it&#39;s right you&#39;ll see a second</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.110" end="00:33:39.900" style="s2">shift in that debate so people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:41.640" style="s2">getting a problem they think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.900" end="00:33:43.350" style="s2">familiar problem and the left</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.640" end="00:33:45.090" style="s2">hemispheres they&#39;re a dominant and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.350" end="00:33:46.470" style="s2">when they have the flash of insight</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.090" end="00:33:49.260" style="s2">you&#39;ll often see a sudden shift of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.470" end="00:33:50.670" style="s2">activity to the right hemisphere right</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.260" end="00:33:52.740" style="s2">because what the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.670" end="00:33:54.870" style="s2">doing it&#39;s doing the meta thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.740" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">Jordan and I are talking about the left</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.870" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">hemisphere that takes a here&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:02.040" style="s2">formulated problem right but your set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">constraints it&#39;s all stable and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.040" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">you&#39;re moving through the search spaces</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:08.250" style="s2">to find the solution but the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.990" style="s2">hemisphere is doing is it&#39;s not moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.250" end="00:34:12.330" style="s2">through a problem formulation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.990" end="00:34:13.950" style="s2">searching through all possible problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:15.930" style="s2">formulations to find a better problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.950" end="00:34:18.390" style="s2">for my formulation and when it finds</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.930" end="00:34:20.460" style="s2">that and then it ships it back and why</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.390" end="00:34:23.310" style="s2">that&#39;s important is because I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.460" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">argue that that notion of you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.310" end="00:34:30.180" style="s2">wonder is much more a right hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:32.250" style="s2">thing and and the point about wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.180" end="00:34:34.080" style="s2">and fuller makes at this point very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.250" end="00:34:37.260" style="s2">in his book is it&#39;s not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.080" end="00:34:39.840" style="s2">bring us to a conclusion it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.260" end="00:34:42.090" style="s2">to bring us to a connection which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.840" end="00:34:44.160" style="s2">that what I was why I saw what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.090" end="00:34:45.900" style="s2">was doing right what you&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.160" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">is he&#39;s not trying to bring about you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.900" end="00:34:49.290" style="s2">know well I need to get more oil but</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">blah blah blah I think I gotta get</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.290" end="00:34:55.320" style="s2">getting this goal is just completely in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:58.350" style="s2">who and what I am no it&#39;s like no the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.320" end="00:35:00.120" style="s2">meta thing is no no there&#39;s this meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.350" end="00:35:03.420" style="s2">issue of how do I stay connected to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.120" end="00:35:05.100" style="s2">reality and and the thing about wonder</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.420" end="00:35:07.830" style="s2">is it&#39;s not solving my particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.100" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">problems what it&#39;s doing is keeping me</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.830" end="00:35:13.110" style="s2">open to that connectedness to reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.790" style="s2">and so I think there&#39;s deep connection</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.110" end="00:35:15.990" style="s2">sorry for that pointing on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.790" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">there&#39;s deep connection between what</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.990" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about in the reference</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:25.260" style="s2">work yeah for sure yeah yeah and the and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:32.760" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s intriguing to me right</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.260" end="00:35:35.340" style="s2">now is thinking about the how do we say</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.760" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">it maybe the sense of holes is a good</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.340" end="00:35:40.680" style="s2">place so this is this is an Albert</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:45.120" style="s2">ruff-ruff language like this is please</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.680" end="00:35:47.820" style="s2">saw this left or the left or right brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.120" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">our were able to talk about them as</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.820" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">distinct things and anatomically they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:53.490" style="s2">in fact actually separated right</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">connected by the corpus callosum which</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:57.120" style="s2">would mean a fact actually physically</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:58.500" style="s2">separating they still go about doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.120" end="00:36:00.870" style="s2">their thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.500" end="00:36:02.550" style="s2">and yet for sure there&#39;s a way for them</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.870" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">to come together and behave in a fashion</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.550" end="00:36:05.910" style="s2">which has the characteristic of being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:08.790" style="s2">certain hole that has a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.910" end="00:36:13.560" style="s2">sensation a different very much capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.790" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">a different caste yes now this being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.560" end="00:36:19.350" style="s2">thing this being a phenomenon in world</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:23.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very unlikely that this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.350" end="00:36:26.100" style="s2">capacity to to do this lives only inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.250" end="00:36:29.160" style="s2">our skulls very unlikely seams insert to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.100" end="00:36:31.470" style="s2">actually propose that rather it is more</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.160" end="00:36:33.120" style="s2">like this is a kind of a general</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.470" end="00:36:35.070" style="s2">phenomenon that is available more</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.120" end="00:36:37.170" style="s2">broadly and therefore and more</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.070" end="00:36:40.500" style="s2">specifically is available more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.170" end="00:36:42.360" style="s2">among us say for example right now I I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.500" end="00:36:46.140" style="s2">agree I totally agree that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.360" end="00:36:48.090" style="s2">translated the McGilchrist language into</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.140" end="00:36:50.580" style="s2">the extinct you between well to find any</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.090" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">other find problems groups or people can</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.580" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">also face well-defined versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:59.460" style="s2">ill-defined problems yeah totally so and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:37:01.800" style="s2">groups of people can behave in a left</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.460" end="00:37:03.630" style="s2">brain dominant fashion obligate left</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.800" end="00:37:06.410" style="s2">brain right so they can become addicted</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.630" end="00:37:08.760" style="s2">to that left brain and they can form</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.410" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">approach the context they find</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.760" end="00:37:14.910" style="s2">themselves in as if it is a well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:17.310" style="s2">context yes this is a mature company</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.910" end="00:37:21.180" style="s2">right the the story of the innovators</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.310" end="00:37:23.790" style="s2">dilemma is that embodied in a group of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.180" end="00:37:26.610" style="s2">people or and also groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.790" end="00:37:28.770" style="s2">therefore by hypothesis can form other</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.610" end="00:37:31.230" style="s2">ways of being in relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.770" end="00:37:33.660" style="s2">other that respond to the contact as</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.230" end="00:37:38.430" style="s2">being an ill-defined problem and that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.660" end="00:37:40.050" style="s2">a question mark right yeah so just to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.430" end="00:37:43.020" style="s2">make it I sort of saw a connection here</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.050" end="00:37:45.270" style="s2">so you&#39;re proposing right distributed</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.020" end="00:37:46.860" style="s2">cognitive level a level of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.270" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">cognition you can get a form of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.860" end="00:37:50.820" style="s2">bullshitting in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:51.690" style="s2">equivocating they&#39;re treating an</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.820" end="00:37:53.460" style="s2">ill-defined thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.690" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">as if it&#39;s still a well-defined thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.460" end="00:37:58.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s another instance of simulated</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">thinking for a group of people as</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.050" end="00:38:02.250" style="s2">opposed to an individual yeah the very</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:04.140" style="s2">concrete so let&#39;s take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.250" end="00:38:07.710" style="s2">exactly how this happens because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.140" end="00:38:09.930" style="s2">equivocation is not you know the word</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.710" end="00:38:12.420" style="s2"> needs to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.930" end="00:38:15.510" style="s2">seriously like it&#39;s yes it works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.420" end="00:38:16.859" style="s2">effective it&#39;s in fact in many ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.510" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">actually adaptive for a short period of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.859" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">time the whole point is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:20.819" style="s2">adapted for a short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:23.849" style="s2">that&#39;s how the advertiser gets you to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.819" end="00:38:26.099" style="s2">buy the alcohol yeah and by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.849" end="00:38:30.300" style="s2">alcohol may in fact make things look</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.099" end="00:38:31.829" style="s2">better for a few minutes yes yep yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.300" end="00:38:36.329" style="s2">I&#39;m in a corporation I&#39;m in a company</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.829" end="00:38:38.579" style="s2">and I have a product a technology that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.329" end="00:38:41.130" style="s2">works really well and it&#39;s making a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.579" end="00:38:43.050" style="s2">of money right and and now I&#39;m by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.130" end="00:38:44.579" style="s2">way inside my corporation I&#39;m following</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.050" end="00:38:45.869" style="s2">my own little mini cater curve if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.579" end="00:38:48.329" style="s2">think about how these things work where</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.869" end="00:38:50.130" style="s2">I have a well-defined problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.329" end="00:38:52.230" style="s2">the problem domain for which my initial</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.130" end="00:38:54.450" style="s2">product was initially was targeted right</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.230" end="00:38:56.819" style="s2">in the context of the ill-defined</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.450" end="00:38:58.380" style="s2">reality of the larger world that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.819" end="00:39:03.569" style="s2">constantly moving and adding ebbing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.380" end="00:39:05.640" style="s2">flowing and changing and but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.569" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">like I&#39;m just using a concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.640" end="00:39:10.170" style="s2">like Blackberry or something like that</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.170" end="00:39:13.290" style="s2">blackberry has a blackberry and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.060" end="00:39:15.180" style="s2">defective and it works and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.290" end="00:39:18.210" style="s2">making some money off of it but of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.180" end="00:39:22.950" style="s2">course the market is changing so context</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.210" end="00:39:26.490" style="s2">the context has changed but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.950" end="00:39:29.250" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is optimized for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.490" end="00:39:31.650" style="s2">particular context that is no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.250" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">current reality yes so they have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.650" end="00:39:36.510" style="s2">choice as a company right they continue</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:39.829" style="s2">to double down on the structures process</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.510" end="00:39:46.020" style="s2">these technologies distribution channels</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.829" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">organizational structures of models that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.020" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">are optimized for a context that is no</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:54.329" style="s2">longer real but is real enough to</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:57.180" style="s2">actually be able to benefit from high</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.329" end="00:39:58.920" style="s2">profitability they can extract value</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.180" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">from it because they&#39;re efficient in in</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.920" end="00:40:05.490" style="s2">a context yes nor do they try to leap</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:06.510" style="s2">back to an innovation there</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.490" end="00:40:08.730" style="s2">right and of course what we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:10.650" style="s2">interesting enough is that it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.730" end="00:40:14.190" style="s2">never the king that a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.650" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">chooses to kill the cash cow and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.190" end="00:40:19.710" style="s2">reprioritize becoming responsive to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:19.710" end="00:40:23.670" style="s2">themselves in right right right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.780" end="00:40:24.810" style="s2">well if efficiency is very seductive</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.670" end="00:40:27.150" style="s2">that way right</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.810" end="00:40:28.110" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve argued in some of my work</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.150" end="00:40:29.100" style="s2">that you know you&#39;re always in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.110" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">trade-off relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.100" end="00:40:34.260" style="s2">efficiency and resiliency and efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:36.330" style="s2">which is often associated with</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.260" end="00:40:39.990" style="s2">exploiting resources rather than</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.330" end="00:40:44.550" style="s2">exploring it&#39;s precisely addictive</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.990" end="00:40:46.740" style="s2">because it intersects with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.550" end="00:40:49.050" style="s2">temporal discounting is right this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.740" end="00:40:51.480" style="s2">our bias to find present stimuli way</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.050" end="00:40:54.030" style="s2">more salient was my language way more</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.480" end="00:40:56.280" style="s2">salient than future stimuli this is why</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.030" end="00:40:58.680" style="s2">when you that&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard is why</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.280" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">dieting has such a massive recidivism</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.680" end="00:41:03.750" style="s2">rate because the the goal of losing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:06.060" style="s2">weight is is in the future and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.750" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">chocolate cake is right here now on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:12.060" style="s2">countertop and so right the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:14.880" style="s2">local efficiencies it tends to plug in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.060" end="00:41:17.640" style="s2">to that temporal discounting machinery</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.880" end="00:41:19.800" style="s2">in very powerful ways so is like well</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.640" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">you know let&#39;s just do it another month</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.800" end="00:41:24.210" style="s2">because we&#39;ll still get more cash right</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:25.830" style="s2">now right and and you can do this in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.210" end="00:41:27.510" style="s2">experiments people will take the ten</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.830" end="00:41:29.160" style="s2">dollars now rather than the hundred</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.510" end="00:41:31.080" style="s2">dollars you know three weeks from now</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.160" end="00:41:32.580" style="s2">kind of deal and there&#39;s something again</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.080" end="00:41:34.830" style="s2">at that diff about temporal discounting</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.580" end="00:41:37.010" style="s2">but again you need you need to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.830" end="00:41:39.720" style="s2">of you need to be able to challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.010" end="00:41:41.190" style="s2">yeah it is it&#39;s particularly maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.720" end="00:41:44.340" style="s2">and Excel in the domain of accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.190" end="00:41:46.470" style="s2">change yes yes exponential curve</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:47.910" style="s2">temporal discounting is is extinction</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.470" end="00:41:52.380" style="s2">err you just don&#39;t know until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.910" end="00:41:55.109" style="s2">done exactly exactly exactly so so go</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.380" end="00:41:58.820" style="s2">ahead go ahead Jordan yes I&#39;m now having</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.109" end="00:42:01.830" style="s2">both my friend Brett Weinstein&#39;s phrase</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.820" end="00:42:03.600" style="s2">evolution goddess here but evolution</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.830" end="00:42:05.700" style="s2">will kill us if we try to use it to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.600" end="00:42:07.470" style="s2">us through here mm-hmm and then I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.700" end="00:42:16.410" style="s2">your your language I think it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.470" end="00:42:18.390" style="s2">language of psycho technologies yes if</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.410" end="00:42:19.220" style="s2">we continue to try to proceed forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.390" end="00:42:21.820" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.220" end="00:42:24.859" style="s2">as our mode of relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.820" end="00:42:25.580" style="s2">the structure evolution put in place to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.859" end="00:42:29.060" style="s2">get us here</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.580" end="00:42:30.680" style="s2">yes we&#39;re because those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.060" end="00:42:33.710" style="s2">responsive to the reality we find</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.680" end="00:42:35.900" style="s2">ourselves in and the solution that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.710" end="00:42:37.700" style="s2">developed that the the solution that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.900" end="00:42:40.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed as humans boost by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.700" end="00:42:42.859" style="s2">way is in fact why we are where we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.310" end="00:42:45.580" style="s2">right it got us the psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.859" end="00:42:48.380" style="s2">the invention of psycho technology is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.580" end="00:42:50.090" style="s2">gift that keeps on giving and it moves</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.380" end="00:42:51.560" style="s2">us further and further away from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.090" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">context that gave rise to it in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.560" end="00:42:54.410" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.630" style="s2">second technology puts us on a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.410" end="00:42:58.310" style="s2">different fitness landscape very nice</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.630" end="00:43:01.369" style="s2">instead of characteristic dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.310" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">so we have to actually formulate the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.369" end="00:43:05.510" style="s2">psycho tech the meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:07.340" style="s2">of engaging in the design of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.510" end="00:43:09.410" style="s2">technology that are in fact responsive</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.340" end="00:43:12.349" style="s2">to the reality that we are finding</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.410" end="00:43:15.859" style="s2">ourselves in and that is a very good oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.349" end="00:43:18.020" style="s2">I really like that that was really that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.859" end="00:43:19.400" style="s2">really saying to me the ladies put that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.020" end="00:43:21.890" style="s2">I really liked that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.400" end="00:43:24.230" style="s2">I really resonated with me that was very</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.890" end="00:43:28.310" style="s2">clear that was that was very insightful</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.230" end="00:43:34.520" style="s2">that drew it all together very nicely so</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.310" end="00:43:37.099" style="s2">it is is that oh yeah that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.520" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">interesting a very cool how would you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.099" end="00:43:42.890" style="s2">summarize that John was that that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:44.839" style="s2">need to we need to mindfully or create</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.890" end="00:43:48.020" style="s2">our own psycho technologies to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.839" end="00:43:49.490" style="s2">through that&#39;s the key well the key</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.020" end="00:43:51.950" style="s2">piece I got out of that is we need to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.490" end="00:43:53.780" style="s2">step back and create a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.950" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">technology for evaluating how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.780" end="00:43:59.990" style="s2">designing our our our psycho</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:01.790" style="s2">technologies and this is analogous to in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.990" end="00:44:03.560" style="s2">problem-solving how you have to you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.790" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">to step back and have meta heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.560" end="00:44:08.810" style="s2">that look at how you are creating and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:11.030" style="s2">selecting the heuristics you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.810" end="00:44:13.310" style="s2">use there&#39;s a very strong parallel there</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.030" end="00:44:15.560" style="s2">and what is it like and think about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.310" end="00:44:18.950" style="s2">here&#39;s an example of exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.560" end="00:44:21.560" style="s2">that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t logic your way</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.950" end="00:44:24.170" style="s2">from a weaker logic to a stronger logic</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:27.020" style="s2">okay look what I mean by that is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.170" end="00:44:30.980" style="s2">if I&#39;m if I&#39;m in predicate logic which</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.020" end="00:44:33.010" style="s2">at which you know has you know all or</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.980" end="00:44:37.490" style="s2">some or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.010" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">as modifiers I using the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.490" end="00:44:42.559" style="s2">that logic I can&#39;t work my way up to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:44.510" style="s2">stronger logic there&#39;s no logical way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.559" end="00:44:46.700" style="s2">do that I can&#39;t go from predicate logic</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.510" end="00:44:49.549" style="s2">to modal logic because what I have to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.700" end="00:44:51.380" style="s2">is I have to step out of the logic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.549" end="00:44:53.150" style="s2">to step out of the logic and look at how</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.380" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">I&#39;m designing my logic and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.150" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">introduce new axioms that are not found</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:58.940" style="s2">within that logic now the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:02.089" style="s2">thing about you is you do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.940" end="00:45:04.730" style="s2">individual you as a child you keep going</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.089" end="00:45:06.849" style="s2">through those changes where you step</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.730" end="00:45:11.089" style="s2">outside because you go through</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.849" end="00:45:13.730" style="s2">qualitative improvement in not only what</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.089" end="00:45:15.710" style="s2">you think but how you can think the kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.730" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">of information processing you can do and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.710" end="00:45:19.910" style="s2">what I saw Jordan doing was proposing</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:22.250" style="s2">exactly that kind of move will you step</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.910" end="00:45:24.980" style="s2">out and you say no no we need a meta</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.250" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">psychic technology whose job it is right</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.980" end="00:45:28.460" style="s2">and and the thing about that is it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:30.710" style="s2">to be sort of dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.460" end="00:45:32.690" style="s2">self-correcting - right because it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:35.329" style="s2">a key it&#39;s got to keep open-ended in how</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.690" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">its monitoring the our our how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.329" end="00:45:39.529" style="s2">designing and coordinating our psycho</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:43.250" style="s2">technologies and I find this really</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.529" end="00:45:44.930" style="s2">relevant because I I keep talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.250" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">we have to think about ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.930" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">practices and ecologies of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:50.089" style="s2">technologies we have to we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:52.460" style="s2">about the relative strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.089" end="00:45:53.990" style="s2">weaknesses all right and we have to we</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.460" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">have to use our technologies in a more</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.990" end="00:45:57.950" style="s2">ecological way where they compensate and</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:46:00.559" style="s2">balance and check each other and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.950" end="00:46:02.329" style="s2">Jordan is proposing is right no but what</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.559" end="00:46:04.279" style="s2">you need is the meta psychic technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.329" end="00:46:07.309" style="s2">that sort of like I say open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.279" end="00:46:09.380" style="s2">that&#39;s actually helping to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.309" end="00:46:10.819" style="s2">that&#39;s what I saw is really crucial did</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.380" end="00:46:13.819" style="s2">that help or did that just make it more</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.819" end="00:46:15.589" style="s2">convoluted I&#39;m not in my head so</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.819" end="00:46:17.259" style="s2">everything you&#39;re saying is yes yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.589" end="00:46:20.690" style="s2">so David did it help</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.259" end="00:46:23.150" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m do you have a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.690" end="00:46:26.630" style="s2">that looks like a matter sico technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.150" end="00:46:29.779" style="s2">can you can you make the matter more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.630" end="00:46:35.390" style="s2">real yeah so one thing one thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.779" end="00:46:36.980" style="s2">argue is is that I think that has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.390" end="00:46:39.049" style="s2">to do with what I&#39;m talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.980" end="00:46:41.960" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about wisdom as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.049" end="00:46:43.190" style="s2">intelligence or even rightly so let let</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.960" end="00:46:45.710" style="s2">me let me let me try and do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.190" end="00:46:47.990" style="s2">concretely okay so let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.710" end="00:46:50.539" style="s2">a particular sacred technology right</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.990" end="00:46:52.430" style="s2">mindfulness that helps me do with</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.539" end="00:46:54.829" style="s2">certain kinds of biases in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.430" end="00:46:58.520" style="s2">attentional processes right and what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.829" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">does is it try to keep at bay all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.520" end="00:47:02.089" style="s2">that influential machinery so I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:03.710" style="s2">concentrate on my attentional processes</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.089" end="00:47:05.569" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what mindfulness does</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.710" end="00:47:07.010" style="s2">right but you don&#39;t want it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.569" end="00:47:09.049" style="s2">want to permanently shut off your</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.010" end="00:47:11.630" style="s2">inferential machinery you need it so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.049" end="00:47:13.400" style="s2">have another psycho technology over here</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.630" end="00:47:15.950" style="s2">called active open mindedness and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.400" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">it does is it prevents the inferential</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.950" end="00:47:21.319" style="s2">machinery from all this salience</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">machinery because what the salience</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.319" end="00:47:25.279" style="s2">machinery is doing is it&#39;s helping you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">make insight the problem is if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.279" end="00:47:27.650" style="s2">let that inappropriately bias my</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:30.289" style="s2">inference</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.650" end="00:47:31.789" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep jumping to conclusions right</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.289" end="00:47:34.099" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you get a lot of bias</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.789" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">in your hand so what I want well I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.099" end="00:47:38.990" style="s2">active open mindedness and I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:42.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a cyclo technology and I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.990" end="00:47:44.270" style="s2">mindfulness and then I want them in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.500" end="00:47:46.010" style="s2">point of processing not adversarial I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.270" end="00:47:47.390" style="s2">want them an opponent process and kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.010" end="00:47:49.250" style="s2">of like your parents sympathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.390" end="00:47:51.799" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system and so what</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.250" end="00:47:54.049" style="s2">you do is you have a higher order right</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.799" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">you have a higher order psycho</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.049" end="00:47:59.029" style="s2">technology that&#39;s designed to try and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:01.279" style="s2">coordinate them together and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.029" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">that that check and balance relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.279" end="00:48:06.650" style="s2">between active open mindedness and</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">mindfulness is ongoing and adaptive if</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.650" end="00:48:12.770" style="s2">if you&#39;re having a hard time imagining</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:15.049" style="s2">it it&#39;s not surprising because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:17.539" style="s2">know how to do it yet you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.049" end="00:48:20.539" style="s2">thing that I&#39;m talking about if you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.539" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">imagine it well then just please just</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.539" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">write it down and start doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:27.020" style="s2">it&#39;s very much the thing and something</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:28.450" style="s2">that John mentioned earlier in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.020" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">thinking about it in the context of say</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.450" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">childhood development or</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">human development particular child</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:39.980" style="s2">development there&#39;s a a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:42.309" style="s2">between the we might call the physical</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.980" end="00:48:43.789" style="s2">layer the anatomical structure</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.309" end="00:48:45.950" style="s2">particularly the neuroanatomical</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.789" end="00:48:47.180" style="s2">structure but the whole body paint</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.950" end="00:48:49.940" style="s2">specifically leveled about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.180" end="00:48:53.510" style="s2">talking about and this capacity to step</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.940" end="00:48:55.849" style="s2">back from of course yes and so we might</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.510" end="00:48:58.250" style="s2">imagine we might hypothesize that there</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.849" end="00:48:59.480" style="s2">is something similar to that that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.250" end="00:49:05.290" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.480" end="00:49:08.420" style="s2">in the context of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.290" end="00:49:14.690" style="s2">for us to be able to have a container a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.420" end="00:49:17.390" style="s2">capacity to be able to hold a meta</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.690" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">psycho technology of this sort I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.390" end="00:49:24.410" style="s2">a very simple okay I&#39;ve got a computer</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:26.540" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got a computer we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.410" end="00:49:27.859" style="s2">compute we can do computation we both do</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.540" end="00:49:31.670" style="s2">spreadsheets like nobody&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.859" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">right until we have a network there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.670" end="00:49:35.600" style="s2">whole bunch of stuff that cannot happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:37.070" style="s2">right and tell those commuters computer</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.600" end="00:49:39.290" style="s2">computers can communicate with each</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.070" end="00:49:41.570" style="s2">other so a network is a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.290" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">of thing and there&#39;s an entire category</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.570" end="00:49:46.550" style="s2">of computational phenomena that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:48.859" style="s2">only just in the context of network</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.550" end="00:49:50.090" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s an example so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.859" end="00:49:52.430" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing is that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.090" end="00:49:53.960" style="s2">not just that&#39;s that&#39;s actually but</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.430" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">pretty good metaphor it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.960" end="00:49:57.320" style="s2">analogy because coach I&#39;ve networked</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:59.660" style="s2">brains together long before the internet</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.320" end="00:50:03.740" style="s2">networked computers together exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.660" end="00:50:08.540" style="s2">when you go on an emergent property who</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.740" end="00:50:09.859" style="s2">are you asking both either yeah I I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.540" end="00:50:11.690" style="s2">it depends what you mean I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.859" end="00:50:13.220" style="s2">for I mean that&#39;s a very philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.690" end="00:50:14.930" style="s2">loaded term but it emerges in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.220" end="00:50:17.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s not found amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.930" end="00:50:19.670" style="s2">constituent components yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.630" end="00:50:23.630" style="s2">novelty there in the competence of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.670" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">cell there&#39;s not ya know the system the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.630" end="00:50:29.240" style="s2">network can do things that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:31.100" style="s2">individual computers can&#39;t do and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.240" end="00:50:38.210" style="s2">the same thing for cultures as cultures</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.100" end="00:50:41.810" style="s2">can do things right so see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.210" end="00:50:44.060" style="s2">there David is there&#39;s a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.810" end="00:50:46.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a necessity to find a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.060" end="00:50:50.090" style="s2">location in culture space a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.359" end="00:50:52.250" style="s2">configuration or style or approach to</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.250" end="00:51:00.830" style="s2">together using grammar using structures</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:04.460" style="s2">and capacities of being in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.830" end="00:51:05.660" style="s2">to there&#39;s a particular the hope where</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.460" end="00:51:07.940" style="s2">this is a finger the fingers crossed is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.660" end="00:51:11.000" style="s2">that there is one in culture space that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.940" end="00:51:12.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require some really deep actual</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.329" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">that&#39;s how I was understanding it that</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.000" end="00:52:34.130" style="s2">kind of thing I suppose that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.940" end="00:52:36.680" style="s2">collective intelligence the thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.130" end="00:52:38.630" style="s2">sense that systems of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.680" end="00:52:40.609" style="s2">cognition can solve problems that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.630" end="00:52:42.950" style="s2">individuals do not have the processing</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.609" end="00:52:45.109" style="s2">power to solve and I think with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.950" end="00:52:47.000" style="s2">is proposing is that at that level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.109" end="00:52:50.660" style="s2">processing if you&#39;ll allow me that Park</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.000" end="00:52:53.089" style="s2">silent lingo we have to find the Metis</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.660" end="00:52:55.250" style="s2">like the technology that will help us</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.089" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">right at the cultural level design</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.250" end="00:52:58.549" style="s2">psycho technologies is that is that what</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:01.970" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing exactly yep that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.549" end="00:53:03.500" style="s2">it that&#39;s cool yeah and we can and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.970" end="00:53:07.579" style="s2">can point to the various approaches that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.500" end="00:53:10.339" style="s2">we can actually do a assessment of all</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.579" end="00:53:13.039" style="s2">the various approaches to distributed</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.339" end="00:53:17.809" style="s2">cognition then thus far have been found</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.039" end="00:53:19.309" style="s2">and we can actually determine that none</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.809" end="00:53:20.750" style="s2">of them can actually get to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.309" end="00:53:22.549" style="s2">location like none of them have the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.750" end="00:53:24.440" style="s2">capacity they have a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.549" end="00:53:26.830" style="s2">different limiting limiting factors on</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.440" end="00:53:30.200" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.830" end="00:53:32.300" style="s2">scalability or on the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.200" end="00:53:34.119" style="s2">conditions of the amount of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.300" end="00:53:36.440" style="s2">that&#39;s actually available because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.119" end="00:53:39.470" style="s2">diminishing returns for exam sir</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.440" end="00:53:42.020" style="s2">yeah and so we can take a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.470" end="00:53:43.580" style="s2">at the scope of the problem the the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.020" end="00:53:46.369" style="s2">thing we&#39;re trying to accomplish we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.580" end="00:53:47.810" style="s2">notice notice that the various tools for</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.369" end="00:53:49.700" style="s2">achieving distribute cognition that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.810" end="00:53:52.609" style="s2">dusts far been developed that have done</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.700" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">good work can&#39;t get us there and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.609" end="00:53:56.900" style="s2">the crude can say okay great now we know</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:53:59.750" style="s2">what we need to do at least vaguely is</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.900" end="00:54:00.890" style="s2">new and then begin the process then well</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.750" end="00:54:03.230" style="s2">how do you design things that are new</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.890" end="00:54:05.810" style="s2">and of course the approach that you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.230" end="00:54:07.940" style="s2">go after is you take a look at what are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.810" end="00:54:11.450" style="s2">constraints we&#39;re examples of what a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.940" end="00:54:12.320" style="s2">good design would consist of and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.450" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">then you do the sort of thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.320" end="00:54:15.980" style="s2">doing right right now which is you you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.930" style="s2">notice where there are all these</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.980" end="00:54:20.180" style="s2">characteristics like that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.930" end="00:54:23.900" style="s2">say oh that&#39;s an example of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.180" end="00:54:26.180" style="s2">right kind of thing right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.900" end="00:54:27.980" style="s2">analogous or maybe stronger than analogy</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.180" end="00:54:29.180" style="s2">to what I&#39;m trying to do in the video</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.980" end="00:54:31.430" style="s2">series right because I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.180" end="00:54:32.660" style="s2">whole historical analysis because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.430" end="00:54:35.150" style="s2">proposing that we have to take a deep</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.660" end="00:54:37.550" style="s2">look at our history right now see right</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.150" end="00:54:42.490" style="s2">and then what I&#39;m part of what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.550" end="00:54:44.810" style="s2">is is is trying to also build towards</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.490" end="00:54:48.800" style="s2">something that I think you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.810" end="00:54:52.010" style="s2">about so here&#39;s a again we have to use</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.800" end="00:54:54.470" style="s2">analogies I guess one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.010" end="00:54:56.270" style="s2">makes people good at insight</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.470" end="00:54:58.099" style="s2">problem-solving this came out of Kaplan</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.270" end="00:54:59.690" style="s2">and Simon&#39;s work is what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.099" end="00:55:02.119" style="s2">notice invariance heuristic and what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.690" end="00:55:04.310" style="s2">do is you look across all these</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.119" end="00:55:07.550" style="s2">instances where you have failed to solve</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.310" end="00:55:09.589" style="s2">the problem and you try and this is hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.550" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">to do and people vary in their capacity</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.589" end="00:55:15.260" style="s2">to you try to notice what you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:18.230" style="s2">changing across all the failures because</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.260" end="00:55:20.830" style="s2">because that that&#39;s often the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.230" end="00:55:22.970" style="s2">you&#39;re most blind to right and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.830" end="00:55:25.430" style="s2">misdirecting what you&#39;re finding salient</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.970" end="00:55:29.060" style="s2">and if you can notice what&#39;s invariant</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.430" end="00:55:30.410" style="s2">that can often help you to say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.060" end="00:55:32.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not an algorithm it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.410" end="00:55:34.099" style="s2">guarantee anything but what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.570" end="00:55:36.410" style="s2">it gives you a good place to look to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.099" end="00:55:38.240" style="s2">intervene for real change and that can</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.410" end="00:55:40.490" style="s2">also often provoke the needed insight</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.240" end="00:55:42.530" style="s2">yeah so David here</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.490" end="00:55:43.970" style="s2">the concept of sovereignty becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.530" end="00:55:47.540" style="s2">interesting thing to spend some time on</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.970" end="00:55:49.730" style="s2">because if you take a look at the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.540" end="00:55:52.280" style="s2">question of what why why why isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.730" end="00:55:54.349" style="s2">easy for this to happen why is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.280" end="00:55:56.150" style="s2">sometimes quite challenging to take a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.349" end="00:55:57.890" style="s2">look at what is not changing</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.150" end="00:56:00.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve lost these different experiments</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.890" end="00:56:02.839" style="s2">and you can take a look at just a given</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.980" end="00:56:04.339" style="s2">given individual human and say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.839" end="00:56:04.940" style="s2">here&#39;s some pasta here&#39;s here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.339" end="00:56:06.710" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.940" end="00:56:11.349" style="s2">there&#39;s many right there&#39;s a lot one</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.710" end="00:56:15.710" style="s2">example might be I have a deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.349" end="00:56:19.580" style="s2">tied like limbic system level connection</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.710" end="00:56:21.770" style="s2">to some aspect of that thing and so my</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.580" end="00:56:23.330" style="s2">pre cognitive processing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.770" end="00:56:25.430" style="s2">already rejecting the analysis of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.330" end="00:56:27.680" style="s2">on the basis of an actual fear of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.430" end="00:56:29.150" style="s2">version response to the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.680" end="00:56:30.470" style="s2">investigating in this area might in fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.150" end="00:56:33.770" style="s2">be a threat to my personal physical</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.470" end="00:56:35.720" style="s2">well-being right that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.770" end="00:56:38.359" style="s2">common and the kind of thing that if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.720" end="00:56:40.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t built the psycho technology the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.359" end="00:56:42.619" style="s2">training to be able to have enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.760" end="00:56:44.990" style="s2">embodied awareness of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.619" end="00:56:46.910" style="s2">responses that you can actually notice</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.990" end="00:56:48.260" style="s2">when that kind of thing is happening it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.910" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">will come through a blind spot it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.260" end="00:56:51.859" style="s2">an unconscious reaction that will make</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:53.359" style="s2">you just go in circles and never know</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.859" end="00:56:54.560" style="s2">why you&#39;re not actually digging deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">because you&#39;re simply avoiding it</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">altogether for very deep fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:01.190" style="s2">these days reasonably well understood</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.420" style="s2">psychological reasons and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.190" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">can go through a long list of those so</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.420" end="00:57:06.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a very long list of them there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:09.109" style="s2">and then of course you do it this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.740" end="00:57:10.820" style="s2">just us Jordan what do you would you</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.109" end="00:57:12.410" style="s2">describe sovereignty as a psycho</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.820" end="00:57:16.490" style="s2">technology yes</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.410" end="00:57:17.750" style="s2">right or some cluster of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.490" end="00:57:20.690" style="s2">technologies that describe a particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.750" end="00:57:23.960" style="s2">capacity to be in response sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.690" end="00:57:26.089" style="s2">really and by the way in is an</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.960" end="00:57:27.290" style="s2">individual and then as an individual as</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.089" end="00:57:29.390" style="s2">part of a group so you can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.290" end="00:57:30.770" style="s2">the individual having sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.390" end="00:57:32.510" style="s2">the relationship with what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.770" end="00:57:33.770" style="s2">and they can talk about the individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.510" end="00:57:35.570" style="s2">having sovereignty and relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.770" end="00:57:37.339" style="s2">other individuals and they can talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.570" end="00:57:39.380" style="s2">about that relationship having</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.339" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">sovereignty in the context that it finds</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.380" end="00:57:42.619" style="s2">itself in right so it&#39;s a it continues</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:45.530" style="s2">to go up and that&#39;s where it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.619" end="00:57:47.180" style="s2">very challenging so John and I right now</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.530" end="00:57:49.400" style="s2">are engaging in a conversation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.180" end="00:57:52.310" style="s2">both ready willing and able as</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.400" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">individuals to take risks with each</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.310" end="00:57:59.089" style="s2">other and by the way take risks in pub</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:58:01.009" style="s2">yeah which takes time like that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.089" end="00:58:02.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not a trivial amount of work to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.009" end="00:58:03.949" style="s2">get to the point of being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.150" end="00:58:05.660" style="s2">that and not to do it recklessly right</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.949" end="00:58:07.849" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously certain typology that</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.660" end="00:58:09.969" style="s2">will simply take risks for bad reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.849" end="00:58:13.039" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.969" end="00:58:15.469" style="s2">so the the the psycho technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.039" end="00:58:17.749" style="s2">sovereignty bring people into a place</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.469" end="00:58:20.900" style="s2">where they have was by say by hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.749" end="00:58:24.410" style="s2">the highest capacity to be able to then</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.900" end="00:58:26.569" style="s2">do the next level of work to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.999" end="00:59:00.619" style="s2">the psychic technology structures that</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.309" end="00:59:02.119" style="s2">give rise to sovereignty and the psycho</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.269" end="00:59:10.549" style="s2">distributed cognition now we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.089" end="00:59:12.759" style="s2">thing now that&#39;s that is where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.549" end="00:59:17.299" style="s2">we&#39;re really getting into a good place</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.759" end="00:59:20.150" style="s2">right I see that so two things came out</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.299" end="00:59:22.699" style="s2">for me for that the first is of one way</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.150" end="00:59:27.140" style="s2">we can ourselves is to keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.699" end="00:59:28.819" style="s2">trying to keep equivocating between what</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.140" end="00:59:31.099" style="s2">you&#39;re describing we need to do which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.819" end="00:59:34.130" style="s2">we need to do this together in a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.099" end="00:59:35.989" style="s2">deep sense of together and equivocating</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.130" end="00:59:37.729" style="s2">and thinking oh no this is an individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.989" end="00:59:39.979" style="s2">sort of theoretical innovation I have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.729" end="00:59:41.929" style="s2">come up with right and it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.979" end="00:59:44.900" style="s2">like no no what this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.929" end="00:59:46.849" style="s2">has to take place within districts we</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.900" end="00:59:49.729" style="s2">have to be participating in distributed</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.849" end="00:59:51.559" style="s2">cognition not just talking about it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.729" end="00:59:53.779" style="s2">order to analyze it but that sounded</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.559" end="00:59:55.609" style="s2">like one of the things you that was an</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.779" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">important point and then the other one</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.609" end="01:00:01.099" style="s2">was it sounded to me like because of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:04.809" style="s2">way you you the way you were</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.099" end="01:00:07.099" style="s2">exemplifying it that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.809" end="01:00:08.180" style="s2">invariants that we&#39;re not noticing very</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.099" end="01:00:10.190" style="s2">well is the fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.180" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">get to 10 we tend to be locked at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.190" end="01:00:15.260" style="s2">propositional individual level as we</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:17.390" style="s2">approach all our problems and it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.260" end="01:00:20.210" style="s2">of inconceivable to us that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.390" end="01:00:22.390" style="s2">way of solving these important problems</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.210" end="01:00:24.589" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna make use of you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.390" end="01:00:26.450" style="s2">participatory and prospective of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.589" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">within distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.450" end="01:00:29.780" style="s2">is that also a fair point the second</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">point oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.780" end="01:00:37.990" style="s2">this is a ubiquitous in fact I I I found</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">myself experiencing this very concretely</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.990" end="01:00:42.410" style="s2">more than a decade ago when trying to</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:43.910" style="s2">discuss this kind of thing well I could</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.410" end="01:00:45.559" style="s2">actually be in conversation with an</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.910" end="01:00:48.290" style="s2">individual I did it happen so many times</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.559" end="01:00:49.369" style="s2">that I became I noticed the physicality</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.290" end="01:00:51.410" style="s2">I think may have described this already</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.369" end="01:00:53.329" style="s2">the physicality of it where a point was</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.410" end="01:00:57.559" style="s2">reached where I could actually see the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.329" end="01:00:58.970" style="s2">pupil get wider and then get smaller as</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.559" end="01:01:00.589" style="s2">the I think it&#39;s the paracin</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.970" end="01:01:04.490" style="s2">parasympathetic nervous system is doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.589" end="01:01:06.980" style="s2">that right yeah is essentially there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.490" end="01:01:10.250" style="s2">something happening where there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.980" end="01:01:13.130" style="s2">building up of an insight and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.250" end="01:01:17.510" style="s2">feeling the recognition if that insight</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.130" end="01:01:20.260" style="s2">leads to consequences that are well</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.510" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">scary and the individual actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.260" end="01:01:24.680" style="s2">literally goes to a and almost</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:26.900" style="s2">instantaneous shift and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.680" end="01:01:30.049" style="s2">propositional logic like a again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.900" end="01:01:31.910" style="s2">the you can&#39;t build a stronger logic</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.049" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">from a weaker logic yeah the weaker</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.910" end="01:01:36.170" style="s2">logic is actually able to hold it should</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.619" style="s2">it&#39;s able to hold a relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.170" end="01:01:42.710" style="s2">the the body in this case the limbic</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.619" end="01:01:44.900" style="s2">system it triggers a limbic response to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.710" end="01:01:46.940" style="s2">be able to short-circuit the insight</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.900" end="01:01:49.819" style="s2">that is ready to happen and it reboots</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.940" end="01:01:51.500" style="s2">itself what was the second thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.819" end="01:01:53.980" style="s2">it was almost aphasic where I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.500" end="01:01:56.630" style="s2">actually find myself repeating the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.980" end="01:01:58.339" style="s2">conversation because there was the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.630" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">reboot was was not just a metaphor as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.339" end="01:02:03.740" style="s2">hard shift in even memory was not what</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:07.339" style="s2">was not held so yes there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.740" end="01:02:10.520" style="s2">capacity to be able to be aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.339" end="01:02:12.829" style="s2">degree to which our world has put us in</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.520" end="01:02:16.150" style="s2">a place where we&#39;ve been so radically</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.829" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">separated from many different modes of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.150" end="01:02:21.839" style="s2">knowing or understanding</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:26.269" style="s2">I would call snowing transitional and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.839" end="01:02:26.269" style="s2">because Batory knowing oh yeah know it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.569" end="01:02:32.519" style="s2">and this there&#39;s a so much so much tide</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.880" end="01:02:34.500" style="s2">at you know please please</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.519" end="01:02:36.660" style="s2">I just wanted to comment on the reason I</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.500" end="01:02:38.430" style="s2">call it knowing is because I want I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.660" end="01:02:40.650" style="s2">to say that all of them are ways in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.430" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">which we connect to reality it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.650" end="01:02:44.970" style="s2">just propositional not knowledge which</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:47.460" style="s2">it&#39;s claims on truth you know procedural</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.970" end="01:02:49.019" style="s2">has claims of power perspectival has</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.460" end="01:02:51.240" style="s2">claims the presence and participatory</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.019" end="01:02:53.220" style="s2">has claims of attunement right and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.240" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">these are all these all contribute to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.220" end="01:02:56.609" style="s2">our sense of being connected to reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:03:00.390" style="s2">so I that&#39;s why I want to use the word</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.609" end="01:03:07.289" style="s2">knowing so that I&#39;m not giving one a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.390" end="01:03:10.049" style="s2">particular privilege yeah yeah men and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.289" end="01:03:12.119" style="s2">the path as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re now like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.049" end="01:03:15.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know how what happens in the in</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.119" end="01:03:17.730" style="s2">the series but the the path of taking an</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.000" end="01:03:18.779" style="s2">individual who has been developed in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.730" end="01:03:22.970" style="s2">world we live in particularly in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.779" end="01:03:26.279" style="s2">West and by the way in in the develop D</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.970" end="01:03:29.519" style="s2">and how separated our our environment</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.279" end="01:03:31.740" style="s2">hat has made us from these different</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.519" end="01:03:33.150" style="s2">modes and they&#39;re now yeah how</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.740" end="01:03:36.180" style="s2">separatist made it made it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.150" end="01:03:38.190" style="s2">sort of temporally but separated in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.180" end="01:03:41.369" style="s2">very deep way like I do believe it we</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.190" end="01:03:44.609" style="s2">are identity connection or a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.369" end="01:03:47.670" style="s2">survival capacity by virtue of being one</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.609" end="01:03:49.410" style="s2">way and not being in the room getting to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.670" end="01:03:53.430" style="s2">the but actually just beginning to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.410" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">able yeah that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.430" end="01:03:58.470" style="s2">mean about the you know yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">that the cognitive grammar and the sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.470" end="01:04:02.039" style="s2">of reciprocal narrowing until we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.380" style="s2">gotten to this point yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.039" end="01:04:05.849" style="s2">culturally right so what you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.380" end="01:04:09.630" style="s2">second half of this this series is going</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.849" end="01:04:11.519" style="s2">to try to you know unpack this dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.630" end="01:04:14.190" style="s2">coupling and and this trade-off between</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.519" end="01:04:16.769" style="s2">efficiency and resiliency in the notion</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.190" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">of relevance realization and how that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.769" end="01:04:23.309" style="s2">essentially open-ended and as always you</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:26.460" style="s2">know we should our attempts to try and</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.309" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">get I&#39;m sorry I use this term because of</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.460" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">its horrible associations so it&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.319" end="01:04:32.790" style="s2">deliberately whenever we try to get out</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:35.520" style="s2">a final solution to what is relevant</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.790" end="01:04:37.590" style="s2">or important to us we&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.520" end="01:04:40.500" style="s2">at the deepest kind of because</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.590" end="01:04:42.570" style="s2">we are thinking that anything can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.500" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">intrinsically relevant or important</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.570" end="01:04:47.150" style="s2">we&#39;re the only thing that&#39;s intrinsic is</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:50.100" style="s2">the ongoing process of finding things</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.150" end="01:04:52.170" style="s2">relevant and important and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.100" end="01:04:54.210" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the main gist of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.170" end="01:04:56.250" style="s2">argument and trying to show how you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.210" end="01:04:58.920" style="s2">we can if we can look at what fourth</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.250" end="01:05:00.450" style="s2">generation cogs is telling us we can see</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.920" end="01:05:02.690" style="s2">about how it&#39;s pointing at twenty us</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.450" end="01:05:05.430" style="s2">back towards embodiment embeddedness</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.690" end="01:05:07.170" style="s2">extended mind distributed cognition a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.430" end="01:05:08.610" style="s2">lot of the machinery the reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.170" end="01:05:10.170" style="s2">can talk to you Jordan about a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.610" end="01:05:12.390" style="s2">this machine is precisely because of</p>
