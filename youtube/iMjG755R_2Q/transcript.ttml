<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">is and how he&#39;s thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.070" end="00:01:12.140" style="s2">evolution of mind science so Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">smacking burger is the consummate</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.140" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">polymath with a background in systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">science and human behavior and is the</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.220" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">now some of you out there are saying ok</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">guys what is this whole neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">thing I&#39;m gonna pass that one over you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">Daniel and tell us a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">yourself and how you got into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">neuro hacking movement please so neuro</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">hacking pretty much means applied</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">neuroscience how can we work with</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">various technologies and modalities to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:04.130" style="s2">increase various aspects of mind brain</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">widely it is technology agnostic meaning</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:59.879" style="s2">capability we&#39;re interested in well</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.659" end="00:03:02.639" style="s2">Daniel I&#39;m glad that you summarized it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.879" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">so succinctly but you just covered the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.639" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">entire field of mind science in about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:10.079" style="s2">two sentences I think it&#39;s amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:13.139" style="s2">you were able to do that but I like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.079" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">idea of technology agnostic because</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.139" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">you&#39;re saying let&#39;s be inclusive let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">not get all of our ducks in one row</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">let&#39;s think about these in a from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">complexity point of view and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:27.889" style="s2">had an opportunity to speak about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">earlier and I think that whole thing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.889" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">complexity systems if you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">little bit about that and how pulling</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">these disparate ideas together might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:43.139" style="s2">constructive yeah when the field of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:44.579" style="s2">psycho no pharmacology started complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.139" end="00:03:46.889" style="s2">system science was not well developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.579" end="00:03:49.049" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really developed at all and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.889" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">our best scientific methodology was</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.049" end="00:03:54.090" style="s2">still variable isolation reductionism so</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">we&#39;re looking specifically to try and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.090" end="00:03:58.139" style="s2">understand what dopamine does or what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">particular molecule that affects some</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.139" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">part of you the dopamine system a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.139" style="s2">presynaptic dopamine agonist or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:05.819" style="s2">dopamine receptor modulator you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.139" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">some some particular part of it what</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.819" end="00:04:11.370" style="s2">that does but that means we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:13.379" style="s2">understand one part in isolation of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.370" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">rest of the whole and to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.379" end="00:04:16.169" style="s2">clinical trials on that appropriately</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of averaging everything else</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.169" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">together and then we see do we get some</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">kind of statistical lift beyond placebo</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">and if we do then that seems interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">even though that bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">has people getting significantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">different experiences on opposite ends</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:33.750" style="s2">the bell curve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:35.640" style="s2">they&#39;re obviously attributable to other</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.750" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">things right the way that one variables</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.640" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">interfacing with the rest of the system</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:42.390" style="s2">and so complex system science allows us</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:43.950" style="s2">to look at a lot more variables a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.390" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">more complexly and look at their</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.950" end="00:04:48.030" style="s2">interactions and their synergies synergy</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:50.520" style="s2">defined as the behavior of whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.030" end="00:04:52.620" style="s2">that is unpredicted by the havior of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.520" end="00:04:54.540" style="s2">parts taken separately in isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.620" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">so one of the problems when we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.540" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">trying to isolate variables is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">synergies between variables get missed</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.710" style="s2">and this is why and the way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">practiced medicine where we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.710" end="00:05:09.780" style="s2">gastroenterology neurology oncology etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">all the diseases that start in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.780" end="00:05:13.200" style="s2">system and move to another system right</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">issues that start in the gut caused</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.200" end="00:05:16.920" style="s2">mucosal barrier dysfunction and end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:18.570" style="s2">causing neurologic issues because</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.920" end="00:05:21.210" style="s2">they&#39;re between systems we end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.570" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">missing so much of the pathology of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.210" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">pathology and what we find is also in</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">radically complex systems everything to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">various degrees in effects everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:33.540" style="s2">else so we need to study that the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.620" end="00:05:36.330" style="s2">causal interactions much more complexly</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.540" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">we also get causal recursion where one</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.330" end="00:05:40.200" style="s2">thing can affect another variable but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.550" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">then that variable can in turn come back</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.200" end="00:05:44.580" style="s2">and reflect that variable both either in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">a regulatory capacity or with positive</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.580" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">feedback loops and so obviously when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:56.130" style="s2">look at the success of psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:05:59.070" style="s2">medicine for all kinds of psych diseases</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.130" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">currently compared to what a system that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.070" end="00:06:04.680" style="s2">was truly adequate for addressing them</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.780" end="00:06:08.520" style="s2">would be we have a huge Delta and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.680" end="00:06:11.100" style="s2">fields of Integrative Psychiatry North</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.520" end="00:06:13.020" style="s2">Molecular Psychiatry you know</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:44.539" style="s2">and then we also start to see that not</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:46.729" style="s2">only are there a lot of variables that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.539" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">are involved but they&#39;re different sets</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.729" end="00:06:49.460" style="s2">of variables for different people and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:50.870" style="s2">this is where we start to get towards</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.460" end="00:06:53.000" style="s2">personalized medicine and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.870" end="00:06:56.060" style="s2">personalized psychology psychiatry and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.000" end="00:06:59.630" style="s2">personalized development so say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:07:02.990" style="s2">looking at anxiety or autism or</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.630" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s and we&#39;re looking at all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.990" end="00:07:06.979" style="s2">things that we know causally are</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">associated right or at least all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.979" end="00:07:12.050" style="s2">things where we have a some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">correlation and so we&#39;ll find maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.050" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">heavy metals are actually statistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:16.669" style="s2">meaningfully correlated with this</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:19.340" style="s2">particular kind of neurodegenerative</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.669" end="00:07:21.349" style="s2">disease but so are other forms of Organa</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.340" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">toxin of organic toxins right</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.349" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">organophosphates VOCs maybe microbial</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">imbalances in the mucosal system may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:32.479" style="s2">parasitic infections may be subclinical</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.479" end="00:07:36.020" style="s2">disorders may be certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:40.220" style="s2">psychological disorders you see all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.020" end="00:07:42.680" style="s2">these things are correlated but not one</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.220" end="00:07:44.690" style="s2">for one which means they statistically</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.680" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">correlate there probably have a causal</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.690" end="00:07:50.289" style="s2">influence sometimes but not all the time</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:53.210" style="s2">because that represents one pathway of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.289" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis that can lead</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.210" end="00:07:59.810" style="s2">to pathophysiology that can lead to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:02.270" style="s2">set of symptomology occurring and when</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.810" end="00:08:03.710" style="s2">we talk about anxiety or Alzheimer&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.270" end="00:08:07.030" style="s2">any kind of disease what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.710" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">about is some similar kinds of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.030" end="00:08:11.720" style="s2">from some similar kinds of tissues but</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:12.620" style="s2">the underlying pathologist can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.720" end="00:08:14.360" style="s2">different that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.620" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">succeeded in really being able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.360" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">address them and so you need to develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:21.949" style="s2">an underlying causal landscape a causal</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">ontology of all the things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.949" end="00:08:27.139" style="s2">associated it could be causal how to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">differential diagnosis across all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.139" end="00:08:31.460" style="s2">those and then how to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:33.289" style="s2">understand different therapies in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.460" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">of the underlying mechanisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.289" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">involved and then what is the weighted</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:40.729" style="s2">subset of that whole causal landscape</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:43.190" style="s2">that&#39;s going on for this person and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.729" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">what what therapies what synergy of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.190" end="00:08:46.250" style="s2">therapies and in what order of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">operations are going to be ideal for</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.250" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">them and this is where we move towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:52.990" style="s2">real personalized medicine personalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:55.630" style="s2">psychotherapy and then be</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.990" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">on the baseline of wellness personalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.630" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">enhancement and development that gets to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">synthesize the best of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:06.970" style="s2">we know today you know while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:09.550" style="s2">talking you say it&#39;s so exceedingly well</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.970" end="00:09:11.649" style="s2">pardon me for being effusive with you a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:14.260" style="s2">little bit but it&#39;s just so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.649" end="00:09:16.089" style="s2">to hear you talk because it&#39;s what so</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.260" end="00:09:17.380" style="s2">many of us struggle with every day it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.089" end="00:09:19.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re a purely</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.380" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">traditional psyche or whether you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:24.430" style="s2">patient coming into a psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">everybody&#39;s looking for the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.430" end="00:09:28.149" style="s2">really in their mind they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">complexity but they don&#39;t have a vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.149" end="00:09:33.730" style="s2">a road a path to consider and wrap their</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">arms around complexity and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.730" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">no thing where the complexity is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:38.920" style="s2">only the variables that you&#39;re speaking</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">about but it&#39;s the complexity of time as</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.920" end="00:09:44.230" style="s2">time comes into the whole situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:46.420" style="s2">because so much of function is time</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.230" end="00:09:48.700" style="s2">related and so much of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.420" end="00:09:50.440" style="s2">dealing with is not time related it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:55.029" style="s2">fine that label to be that way to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.440" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">next hundred years yeah we also have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.029" end="00:10:00.279" style="s2">when we&#39;re at a time we have all of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:02.860" style="s2">conditions that have very delayed</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.279" end="00:10:04.270" style="s2">causation delayed onset and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.860" end="00:10:06.700" style="s2">something that always makes diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">tricky as if something has a rapid onset</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.700" end="00:10:11.140" style="s2">following a pretty clear cause it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:14.410" style="s2">little bit easier to treat but if</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.140" end="00:10:16.180" style="s2">something has a either a rapid onset but</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.410" end="00:10:17.649" style="s2">not following any clear cause or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.180" end="00:10:21.399" style="s2">the clear cause that it followed was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.649" end="00:10:22.950" style="s2">simply a last trigger of a whole causal</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.399" end="00:10:25.800" style="s2">chain that moved it in the symptomology</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.950" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">then it&#39;s very easy to miss attribute it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.800" end="00:10:31.510" style="s2">and so we need to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:33.370" style="s2">diagnosis thinking about things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.510" end="00:10:37.420" style="s2">might have happened a long time ago but</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.370" end="00:10:40.810" style="s2">not resulted in symptomology and then as</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.420" end="00:10:43.480" style="s2">we as we&#39;re treating of course here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.810" end="00:10:47.770" style="s2">one of the things I would say is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.480" end="00:10:50.829" style="s2">deep to our goals is we have this</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.770" end="00:10:52.600" style="s2">internal regulatory system right this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.829" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">endogenous regulatory system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.600" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">not one regulatory system but you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">think of all the different regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:01.560" style="s2">axes as a comprehensive regulatory or</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:04.329" style="s2">cybernetic system and we&#39;re regulating</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.560" end="00:11:06.370" style="s2">pH and redox interactions and glucose</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.329" end="00:11:06.910" style="s2">and you know transmitters and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">all the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.910" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">within specific ranges so if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">dopamine is really low and I just give</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:21.310" style="s2">them a in chain dopamine that agonist</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">without asking why was it low was it low</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.310" end="00:11:25.270" style="s2">because they aren&#39;t eating enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">protein that contains the amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.270" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">precursors is it because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:30.760" style="s2">digest the protein because of a issue in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">their stomach they can&#39;t absorb it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.760" end="00:11:34.630" style="s2">because if an issue in their intestines</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.930" end="00:11:37.060" style="s2">can they not convert those amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.630" end="00:11:40.270" style="s2">can they not convert the tyrosine into</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.060" end="00:11:42.340" style="s2">l-dopa into dopamine are there enzyme</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.270" end="00:11:46.120" style="s2">deficiencies are there so if I go</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.340" end="00:11:49.780" style="s2">straight to giving the in chain agonist</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.120" end="00:11:51.520" style="s2">and of course whatever else was affected</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.780" end="00:11:53.530" style="s2">downstream I&#39;m not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.520" end="00:11:55.060" style="s2">supporting right and say it was say it</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.530" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">was a tyrosine mechanism well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.060" end="00:11:59.370" style="s2">also affecting their thyroid right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:02.170" style="s2">also affecting so many other systems and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.370" end="00:12:04.870" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get some side effects because</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.170" end="00:12:06.640" style="s2">now I&#39;m creating a fixed level of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.870" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">chemical independent of the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.640" end="00:12:11.860" style="s2">realtime regulation of it which is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:13.840" style="s2">throw out the balance with the you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.860" end="00:12:15.190" style="s2">literally trillions of other chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.840" end="00:12:17.380" style="s2">that it should be interacting with with</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.190" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">more complexity than that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.380" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">creating exogenous dependence right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:23.770" style="s2">rather than the body being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:26.490" style="s2">self-regulate it&#39;s depending on external</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.770" end="00:12:31.270" style="s2">regulation and so now there&#39;s ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.490" end="00:12:33.870" style="s2">dependence our goal is that any good</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.270" end="00:12:35.890" style="s2">system of medicine and good system of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.870" end="00:12:38.470" style="s2">psychiatry and good system of biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.890" end="00:12:40.660" style="s2">neuro hacking should be supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.470" end="00:12:44.650" style="s2">endogenous regulatory systems to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.660" end="00:12:46.750" style="s2">increased regulatory capacity and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.650" end="00:12:48.550" style="s2">really define health as the robustness</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.750" end="00:12:52.930" style="s2">and resilience of the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.550" end="00:12:56.010" style="s2">capacity of the entire system and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.930" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">we can think about aging actually as</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.010" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">decreased homeostatic resilience on some</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:03.700" style="s2">of the axes and then we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:05.830" style="s2">disease as some deviations from</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.810" end="00:14:04.520" style="s2">have a single answer so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.300" end="00:14:06.950" style="s2">things that happens is people come a guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.520" end="00:14:10.520" style="s2">like me and they say you know I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.950" end="00:14:11.990" style="s2">this problem well how come I have to do</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.900" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s an interesting issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.150" end="00:14:31.940" style="s2">to address with our our audience because</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.940" end="00:14:35.770" style="s2">audience how do we actually deal with</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.470" end="00:14:39.110" style="s2">the complexity on a street level right I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.770" end="00:14:43.690" style="s2">would say the Silver Bullet mentality is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.110" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">a broken mentality in every area every</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.220" end="00:15:01.070" style="s2">the answer to getting buff or</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.880" end="00:15:04.700" style="s2">psychologically well or anything it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.070" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">always requires any kind of development</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.700" end="00:15:12.230" style="s2">of any system requires continuous varied</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:15.650" style="s2">kinds of input and entropy is always</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.230" end="00:15:18.530" style="s2">acting on systems and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.650" end="00:15:20.270" style="s2">minimum and it&#39;s acting on on all</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.530" end="00:15:22.730" style="s2">systems right you have oxidative stress</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.270" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">on cells you have excitotoxin stress you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.730" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">have mutation that&#39;s occurring you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:30.260" style="s2">got and so it&#39;s you&#39;ve got entropy</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">occurring on all these systems you need</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.260" end="00:15:36.149" style="s2">to be putting in at least as much energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">and by energy here I don&#39;t mean glucose</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.149" end="00:15:40.769" style="s2">and Jaime putting in at least as much of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">the appropriate kind of input as is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.769" end="00:15:48.570" style="s2">eroding and to just even keep up right</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">and just like anyone knows that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.570" end="00:15:52.140" style="s2">someone works out for ten years</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:53.459" style="s2">gets buff this can be the moment they</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.140" end="00:15:58.620" style="s2">stop working out they start losing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.459" end="00:16:00.450" style="s2">and it is entropies this just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.620" end="00:16:04.790" style="s2">universal recycling process of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:07.260" style="s2">which is not no longer useful right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.790" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">so then it starts moving those parts to</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.260" end="00:16:12.510" style="s2">be used for something else so any kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:14.940" style="s2">of health any kind of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.510" end="00:16:17.310" style="s2">requires continuous input and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.940" end="00:16:20.220" style="s2">appropriate kinds of continuous input so</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.310" end="00:16:22.680" style="s2">we know that there are so many different</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.220" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">minerals depending upon which list you</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.680" end="00:16:27.260" style="s2">read of how many are essential at 72 or</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:29.339" style="s2">84 or 92 right but there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.260" end="00:16:31.200" style="s2">minerals that are essential for health</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.339" end="00:16:33.000" style="s2">there&#39;s so many vitamins so many</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.200" end="00:16:36.149" style="s2">phytonutrients so many macronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.000" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">and even a deficiency of one of them can</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.149" end="00:16:41.010" style="s2">lead to a debilitating disease right</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:42.990" style="s2">just D being low leading the rickets or</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.010" end="00:16:47.910" style="s2">C being well leading to scurvy or b1</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.990" end="00:16:53.160" style="s2">leading a berry berry and so Liam if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.910" end="00:16:54.390" style="s2">want to not see it&#39;s not just them being</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.160" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">low enough that they go into acute</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.390" end="00:16:58.290" style="s2">pathology it&#39;s also the sub clinical</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.630" style="s2">pathology of systems that are working</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.290" end="00:17:01.829" style="s2">they&#39;re just not working optimally and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.630" end="00:17:03.449" style="s2">now we&#39;re not just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.829" end="00:17:07.860" style="s2">nutrients and but we&#39;re also talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.449" end="00:17:09.510" style="s2">about input that supports detox an input</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.860" end="00:17:10.470" style="s2">that supports antioxidant</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.510" end="00:17:15.030" style="s2">anti-inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.470" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">is not a nutrient per se but it is part</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.030" end="00:17:18.829" style="s2">of what&#39;s going to support system</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:21.449" style="s2">regulation so yes I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.829" end="00:17:27.630" style="s2">anyone who wants to be really healthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.449" end="00:17:30.450" style="s2">and vital and optimized has to take full</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.630" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">responsibility for what that means and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.450" end="00:17:34.650" style="s2">not expect that there&#39;s a very easy</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">doctor solution or a single kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.650" end="00:17:41.130" style="s2">solution and just embrace that as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:42.510" style="s2">the physics of universe I mean that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.510" end="00:17:46.890" style="s2">solutely true I mean that is what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">deal with either we&#39;re gonna deal with</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.890" end="00:17:51.480" style="s2">the complexity now and and some of us</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:54.270" style="s2">may be interested in how do we package</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.480" end="00:17:55.950" style="s2">the complexity yeah do have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.270" end="00:17:58.890" style="s2">understand the complexity they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.950" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">just go out and shotgun the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.890" end="00:18:05.490" style="s2">because that absolutely won&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:08.430" style="s2">has to honor the integrity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.490" end="00:18:10.530" style="s2">in some constructive way and even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.430" end="00:18:14.040" style="s2">there there is a complexity involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.530" end="00:18:16.500" style="s2">that the integrity of that system has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.040" end="00:18:18.180" style="s2">have somehow be packaged in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.500" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">the person on the street can actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.180" end="00:18:23.370" style="s2">you know what&#39;s what&#39;s a what&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:26.250" style="s2">systems approach to that particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.370" end="00:18:28.470" style="s2">problem right when I think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.250" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">doing with the podcast here is offering</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.470" end="00:18:33.480" style="s2">people education so that they can feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:35.460" style="s2">more empowered in what are likely</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.480" end="00:18:37.710" style="s2">appropriate avenues for them to dive</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.460" end="00:18:40.380" style="s2">deeper into what we&#39;re seeking to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.710" end="00:18:41.820" style="s2">over at no hacker collective is you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.380" end="00:18:43.590" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re developing specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.820" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">technologies so they can go direct to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.590" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">consumer right now we&#39;re developing more</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">that might not go direct to consumer but</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:52.800" style="s2">be you know mediated by some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:19:00.390" style="s2">therapists but what we&#39;re really looking</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.800" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">to do long range is a platform that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.390" end="00:19:06.090" style="s2">allows us to integrate all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:09.000" style="s2">complexity personalize them to an</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.090" end="00:19:10.590" style="s2">individual and their goals and actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.000" end="00:19:13.950" style="s2">make the interface very simple for them</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.590" end="00:19:17.820" style="s2">and so if we can collect all of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.950" end="00:19:20.520" style="s2">biometrics from their genetics to their</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:26.520" style="s2">whatever we can take all those biometric</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.120" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">data pieces and we can take psycho</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.520" end="00:19:29.670" style="s2">metrics we can do cognitive assessments</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:31.710" style="s2">that look at various aspects of</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.710" end="00:19:37.980" style="s2">assessments psychoanalytic assessments</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.900" end="00:19:40.050" style="s2">then and then not just look at each of</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.050" end="00:19:44.100" style="s2">own reference range but look at each of</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.100" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">did this particular picture arise</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.600" end="00:19:55.680" style="s2">in terms of factoring all of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:59.480" style="s2">underlying inter causal dynamics then we</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.680" end="00:20:03.870" style="s2">can start to get a real picture of</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.260" end="00:20:15.180" style="s2">mechanics in terms of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.980" end="00:20:18.150" style="s2">genetics and fundamental space of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.180" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">person and then be able to synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.150" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">what are all of the technologies that do</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">have known efficacy for sleep and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:27.450" style="s2">relate them to underlying mechanics or</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:29.220" style="s2">anxiety or whatever it is and then be</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.450" end="00:20:31.080" style="s2">able to say these ones are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.220" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">most effective for this person at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.080" end="00:20:36.390" style="s2">time you know highest probability so</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:38.160" style="s2">this is N equals one optimization the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.390" end="00:20:41.550" style="s2">clinical trial can&#39;t do that right it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.160" end="00:20:44.310" style="s2">can only say there is some left with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.550" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">bell curve compared to placebo even</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.310" end="00:20:46.740" style="s2">though the people in one in the bell</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:48.810" style="s2">curve and the other having totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.740" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">different experiences when you try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.810" end="00:20:53.400" style="s2">put everybody on the front of a bell</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:56.160" style="s2">curve now we&#39;re not saying okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.400" end="00:20:57.900" style="s2">this device or supplements or meditation</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.160" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">technology or whatever I&#39;m gonna give it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.900" end="00:21:01.350" style="s2">to ruin because I have a hammer I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:04.170" style="s2">gonna say that everything is a nail</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.350" end="00:21:05.850" style="s2">right and we can say you have anxiety so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.170" end="00:21:07.110" style="s2">take a benzo are you having xiety so do</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.850" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">this breathing technique or meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.110" end="00:21:11.870" style="s2">technique and it might help some but if</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:14.580" style="s2">the person&#39;s anxiety is related to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.870" end="00:21:17.160" style="s2">parasitic brain access disorder none of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.580" end="00:21:18.780" style="s2">those solutions are gonna fix it and if</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.160" end="00:21:20.910" style="s2">it&#39;s related to a head trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.780" end="00:21:22.140" style="s2">there&#39;s some actual neural circuitry to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.910" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2">address none of those are going to fix</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.140" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">it but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:26.190" style="s2">things that could fix it and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:27.540" style="s2">mean that they wouldn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.190" end="00:21:29.220" style="s2">differently if we know how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.540" end="00:21:32.010" style="s2">right assessments and then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.220" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">direct people to you know what is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.010" end="00:21:34.530" style="s2">highest probability of greatest success</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:37.830" style="s2">for them which is actually now not that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.530" end="00:21:39.420" style="s2">complicated but it draws on all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.830" end="00:21:45.330" style="s2">complexity of everything we know both</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.420" end="00:21:47.160" style="s2">about psychology physiology the mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.330" end="00:21:50.310" style="s2">brain interface and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.160" end="00:21:53.910" style="s2">diagnostic and therapeutic modalities so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.310" end="00:21:57.510" style="s2">it has a simultaneous activity of ruling</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.910" end="00:22:01.890" style="s2">out and ruling in so it&#39;s not just yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.510" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">ruling out Frank its ruling in</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.890" end="00:22:07.860" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:11.040" style="s2">point because that takes us over to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.860" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">affirmative prospect so how does this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.040" end="00:22:16.620" style="s2">thing actually work effectively as</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.530" style="s2">opposed to here&#39;s what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.620" end="00:22:22.020" style="s2">here&#39;s how we can see this pathology</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.530" end="00:22:25.140" style="s2">okay this is this is a sick broken</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.020" end="00:22:27.930" style="s2">system you&#39;re saying well that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.140" end="00:22:30.390" style="s2">only above the picture and if we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.930" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">lost over there which I think in truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.390" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">many of us are then we&#39;re arrested we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:39.560" style="s2">developmentally arrested we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:41.550" style="s2">of great insight rate in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.560" end="00:22:43.080" style="s2">integrative medicine and functional</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.550" end="00:22:46.170" style="s2">medicine I think have been doing a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.080" end="00:22:48.390" style="s2">job progressively of trying to see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.170" end="00:22:50.160" style="s2">do we factor more systems so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.390" end="00:22:52.110" style="s2">look at the gastro neurology and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.160" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">neurology and the oncology and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.110" end="00:22:56.060" style="s2">rheumatology together right and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:58.530" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna look at the various</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.060" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">intercostal worlds together the genomics</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.530" end="00:23:01.590" style="s2">and the microbiome X and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:03.330" style="s2">transcriptomics and the proteomics and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.590" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">the you know that that way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.330" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">the body and we&#39;re gonna look at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.130" end="00:23:10.770" style="s2">different kinds of deviations from</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:13.530" style="s2">homeostasis toxins nutrient deficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.770" end="00:23:15.390" style="s2">genetic disorders infections right and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.530" end="00:23:16.920" style="s2">how do we work with those and try and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.390" end="00:23:18.540" style="s2">make some sense out of this and so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.920" end="00:23:20.030" style="s2">can see various people who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.540" end="00:23:22.620" style="s2">at the cutting edge in those spaces</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.030" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">doing a better job of synthesizing more</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.620" end="00:23:27.540" style="s2">things now synthesizing and aggregating</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.920" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">are different right aggregating is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.540" end="00:23:30.150" style="s2">shotgun approach which just says all</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:31.620" style="s2">right well all these have some</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.150" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">effectiveness let&#39;s kind of try all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.620" end="00:23:37.470" style="s2">them synthesis is well these ones are</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.350" end="00:23:39.210" style="s2">effective for for these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.470" end="00:23:41.070" style="s2">mechanisms not just these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.210" end="00:23:43.770" style="s2">engine conditions they can have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.070" end="00:23:45.510" style="s2">mechanisms leading into them so how do</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.770" end="00:23:48.600" style="s2">we do the differential diagnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.510" end="00:23:51.030" style="s2">know what to do then for that person and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.600" end="00:23:54.030" style="s2">how do we do right order of operations</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.030" end="00:23:57.060" style="s2">right so if it&#39;s functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.030" end="00:23:59.430" style="s2">gets into quite a lot when you need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.060" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">treat a gut barrier disorder before</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.430" end="00:24:04.020" style="s2">trying to address blood toxicity issues</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:05.280" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re gonna can or</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:08.190" style="s2">Rheumatology because you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.280" end="00:24:10.500" style="s2">keep having inflammation from from tight</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.190" end="00:24:12.390" style="s2">Junction issues whatever so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.500" end="00:24:16.050" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a very good job but</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.390" end="00:24:17.310" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it like you go to a con</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.050" end="00:24:18.660" style="s2">and you look at all the cutting-edge</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.310" end="00:24:21.060" style="s2">research that&#39;s happening in various</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.660" end="00:24:25.110" style="s2">fields it&#39;s more than any human can</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.060" end="00:24:26.490" style="s2">actually synthesize and when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.110" end="00:24:27.780" style="s2">all the medical journals that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.490" end="00:24:29.400" style="s2">out with actually good underlying</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.780" end="00:24:30.870" style="s2">mechanistic insights it&#39;s again more</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.400" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">than any human can synthesize which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.870" end="00:24:38.010" style="s2">why it takes this kind of AI platform</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:40.140" style="s2">methodology to be able to vet and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.010" end="00:24:43.050" style="s2">synthesize at scale and then make all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.140" end="00:24:47.280" style="s2">human knowledge available to individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.050" end="00:24:52.680" style="s2">practitioners and individual people so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.280" end="00:24:55.110" style="s2">was like a Wikipedia of the mind some</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.680" end="00:24:58.770" style="s2">constructive way yeah yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.110" end="00:25:00.840" style="s2">AI is artificial intelligence yes just</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.770" end="00:25:06.060" style="s2">to say that because I know some of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.840" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">listeners may wonder what a is so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.060" end="00:25:11.010" style="s2">the next question after that is do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:13.770" style="s2">you are developing a system then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.010" end="00:25:16.860" style="s2">developing ways of doing this and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.770" end="00:25:21.930" style="s2">codifying and how you know is this gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.860" end="00:25:23.730" style="s2">happen in a computer model of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.930" end="00:25:25.860" style="s2">is it going to be it sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.730" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">going in that direction that when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.860" end="00:25:32.310" style="s2">feed the material in and you do a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">certain and number of tests then you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.310" end="00:25:37.770" style="s2">feed it in and pop something out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.620" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">going to be more easily accessible than</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.770" end="00:25:46.170" style="s2">then just plain thinking it through yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">definitely so you can see that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.170" end="00:25:53.850" style="s2">already have labs that automate some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:57.420" style="s2">the suggestions based on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.850" end="00:26:00.450" style="s2">standard protocols from what they see in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.420" end="00:26:02.490" style="s2">the lab so you get the lab back and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.450" end="00:26:07.050" style="s2">have depending upon say you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:10.050" style="s2">that you know gut barrier assessment</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.050" end="00:26:12.120" style="s2">then based on what&#39;s showing up in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.050" end="00:26:14.790" style="s2">lab you&#39;ll see some generated pages of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.120" end="00:26:17.310" style="s2">common best practices you also already</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.790" end="00:26:19.320" style="s2">have systems of electronic medical</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.310" end="00:26:20.760" style="s2">records that start putting some pieces</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.320" end="00:26:23.370" style="s2">of the data together start giving you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.760" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">some analytics so that&#39;s the trend in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.370" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">that direction those are just relatively</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">low intelligence systems and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.430" end="00:26:35.340" style="s2">so what what is interesting is as we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.700" end="00:26:39.320" style="s2">start harvesting a lot more biometric</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.340" end="00:26:41.280" style="s2">data then it becomes less and less</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.320" end="00:26:44.430" style="s2">understandable by an individual person</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.280" end="00:26:47.340" style="s2">in real-time so if we start doing whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.430" end="00:26:51.300" style="s2">genome sequences and want to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.340" end="00:26:52.740" style="s2">whole genome right that&#39;s a lot and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.300" end="00:26:55.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not just looking at individuals</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.740" end="00:26:57.450" style="s2">snips right individual genes and their</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.950" end="00:27:00.930" style="s2">polymorphisms it&#39;s looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.450" end="00:27:03.810" style="s2">combinatorics on that and now that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.930" end="00:27:04.710" style="s2">scales very quickly and then that still</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.810" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell you about gene expression</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.710" end="00:27:09.860" style="s2">and so then we&#39;re looking at clinical</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:15.330" style="s2">chemistry and metabolomics</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.860" end="00:27:18.360" style="s2">transcriptomics etc and so but all we</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.330" end="00:27:20.490" style="s2">can understand the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.360" end="00:27:22.380" style="s2">that are happening and we can build</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.490" end="00:27:25.890" style="s2">systems to be able to model this better</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.380" end="00:27:28.020" style="s2">and do a better job of making more sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.890" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">of more different kinds of data in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.020" end="00:27:35.430" style="s2">synthesized fashion so that&#39;s the goal I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.790" style="s2">mean how can you say all that in one</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.430" end="00:27:38.970" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.790" end="00:27:41.100" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s so interesting you know so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:43.020" style="s2">then how are you actually breaking that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.100" end="00:27:45.210" style="s2">down in neuro hacker I mean I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.020" end="00:27:47.250" style="s2">to ask for any proprietary but just to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.210" end="00:27:52.500" style="s2">little bit of an idea because it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.250" end="00:27:56.130" style="s2">so very large to the questions you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.500" end="00:27:58.440" style="s2">raising or so enormous in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.130" end="00:28:02.790" style="s2">practical how does one do that to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.440" end="00:28:04.230" style="s2">it yeah well if you go to you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.790" end="00:28:05.460" style="s2">hacker comm right now you won&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.230" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">anything about anything we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.460" end="00:28:12.990" style="s2">about you will see a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:17.450" style="s2">information on complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.990" end="00:28:20.040" style="s2">applied to neuroscience and you will see</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.450" end="00:28:22.950" style="s2">some cognitive enhancement supplements</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.040" end="00:28:24.120" style="s2">for sale so we&#39;re a relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.950" end="00:28:25.830" style="s2">organization and so we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.120" end="00:28:30.110" style="s2">somewhere like every organization needs</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.830" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">to and for us well we knew the goal was</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.110" end="00:28:34.440" style="s2">C I&#39;m talking about diagnostic methods</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:36.510" style="s2">here but let&#39;s look at the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.440" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">side for a moment and you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.510" end="00:28:41.640" style="s2">disease model side which is you know how</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:43.240" style="s2">do we get people back to wellness from</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.640" end="00:28:44.679" style="s2">some diagnosed disease</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.240" end="00:28:46.870" style="s2">then you have the enhancement side and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.679" end="00:28:48.160" style="s2">so neuro hacker has started in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.870" end="00:28:52.650" style="s2">its forward facing offerings on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">direct-to-consumer enhancement side and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.650" end="00:28:57.040" style="s2">if you think of neural hacking kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:29:00.130" style="s2">as a subset of biohacking that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.040" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">specifically focused and and that just</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.130" end="00:29:06.670" style="s2">means applied technologies for personal</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:09.780" style="s2">enhancement but we&#39;re specifically</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.670" end="00:29:13.500" style="s2">focused on the mind brain space so</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.780" end="00:29:16.690" style="s2">enhancing cognitive and enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:22.390" style="s2">emotional and psychological both</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.690" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">well-being and capability there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.390" end="00:29:26.679" style="s2">of different technologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:28.660" style="s2">effective as we were mentioning you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.679" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">so we were looking at whether we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.660" end="00:29:33.340" style="s2">to develop better systems of EEG</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.500" style="s2">neurofeedback or better systems of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.340" end="00:29:39.340" style="s2">transcranial lasers for up regulating</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.500" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">neuronal ATP or better systems of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.340" end="00:29:46.450" style="s2">computer-based psychotherapy or that can</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:49.150" style="s2">you know work on a widely through a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.450" end="00:29:51.400" style="s2">platform or the better kind better kinds</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.150" end="00:29:53.500" style="s2">of neural chemical solutions and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.400" end="00:29:54.700" style="s2">all very meaningful and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.500" end="00:29:56.679" style="s2">differently meaningful for different</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.700" end="00:29:58.600" style="s2">kinds of people and so our goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.679" end="00:30:02.620" style="s2">synthesize to be able to have a space</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.600" end="00:30:04.360" style="s2">where if someone had a goal no matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.620" end="00:30:06.790" style="s2">what the goal was in the psychoneurosis</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.360" end="00:30:09.070" style="s2">and no matter what the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.790" end="00:30:11.830" style="s2">physiology they had going on there could</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.070" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">be a best synthesized resource for them</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.830" end="00:30:17.620" style="s2">and so we started in the know tropic</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:19.420" style="s2">space of cognitive enhancement because</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.620" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">we&#39;d work in that space deeply and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.420" end="00:30:24.910" style="s2">knew that we could do very potent of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:26.740" style="s2">life enhancing things for people they</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.910" end="00:30:31.720" style="s2">were not currently available on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.740" end="00:30:34.570" style="s2">market and we could do that easier then</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.720" end="00:30:36.970" style="s2">we could build this AI system and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.570" end="00:30:39.820" style="s2">this was a and then you know from there</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.970" end="00:30:42.490" style="s2">a whole line of direct-to-consumer</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.820" end="00:30:45.790" style="s2">biochemistry so specific kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.490" end="00:30:47.500" style="s2">nutraceuticals that we didn&#39;t see on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.790" end="00:30:49.059" style="s2">market anywhere else because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.500" end="00:30:50.679" style="s2">working with this complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.059" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">framework of not trying to say alright</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.679" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">we&#39;re we have a sleep mode and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:55.389" style="s2">working with gaba or melatonin or you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">know but</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.389" end="00:30:58.929" style="s2">what are all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:02.529" style="s2">involved and how do we up regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.929" end="00:31:04.869" style="s2">endogenous circuitry and obviously to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.529" end="00:31:06.549" style="s2">this at full scale we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.869" end="00:31:08.139" style="s2">do it in a customized fashion and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.549" end="00:31:10.749" style="s2">what requires this underlying system so</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.139" end="00:31:12.639" style="s2">we&#39;re starting with not customized but</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.749" end="00:31:14.679" style="s2">center of the bell curve very effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.639" end="00:31:17.129" style="s2">for most people and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.679" end="00:31:19.929" style="s2">currently have then we&#39;re moving into</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.129" end="00:31:21.369" style="s2">phenotype specific so before it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.929" end="00:31:24.789" style="s2">personalized we find that there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.369" end="00:31:26.889" style="s2">handfuls of kind of neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.789" end="00:31:28.239" style="s2">phenotypes so like in the Walsh work</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.889" end="00:31:29.889" style="s2">you&#39;ve looked at under an over meth</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.239" end="00:31:33.549" style="s2">later is a different underlying</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.889" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">structure right under an over</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.549" end="00:31:38.469" style="s2">catecholamine urge ik under an over</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:39.999" style="s2">cholinergic CNS stimulation so we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.469" end="00:31:42.820" style="s2">get more effective just through those</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.999" end="00:31:46.599" style="s2">kind of categories and then move into</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.820" end="00:31:53.829" style="s2">full customization but it&#39;s also of all</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.599" end="00:31:56.769" style="s2">the things one could do how likely is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.829" end="00:31:59.879" style="s2">vagal nerve stimulator versus a</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.769" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">transcranial stimulator versus this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.879" end="00:32:04.209" style="s2">breathing technique versus these</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:05.799" style="s2">biochemical gaba</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.209" end="00:32:08.289" style="s2">Eric&#39;s going to be most useful for them</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.799" end="00:32:10.149" style="s2">even at that level so we started</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.289" end="00:32:11.829" style="s2">building technologies in each of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.149" end="00:32:14.289" style="s2">categories some are in market already</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.829" end="00:32:16.389" style="s2">some are still in R&amp;D and over the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.289" end="00:32:18.489" style="s2">year a lot will be going coming to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.389" end="00:32:22.119" style="s2">market and this allows us to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.489" end="00:32:24.129" style="s2">grow our research team and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.119" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">continuing development and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.129" end="00:32:28.959" style="s2">underlying platform we&#39;re working on but</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:34.599" style="s2">you know that that has some years before</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.959" end="00:32:35.889" style="s2">its meaning meaning ly applicable well</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.599" end="00:32:38.169" style="s2">the issue is because you&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.889" end="00:32:40.599" style="s2">to have you&#39;re really in kind of a data</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.169" end="00:32:44.409" style="s2">acquisition mode from what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.599" end="00:32:46.629" style="s2">you&#39;re you you know generally what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.409" end="00:32:49.299" style="s2">problem is but then you&#39;re codifying and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.629" end="00:32:51.309" style="s2">breaking it down and doing some serious</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.299" end="00:32:56.549" style="s2">data acquisition because then you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.309" end="00:33:00.909" style="s2">push the button and have some configure</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.549" end="00:33:04.269" style="s2">so yeah we are as far as that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.909" end="00:33:06.129" style="s2">acquisition goes not mostly in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.269" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">feedback from current things we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.129" end="00:33:15.549" style="s2">that&#39;s useful this is why</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:18.309" style="s2">we do trials but it is doing doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.549" end="00:33:20.260" style="s2">structured reviews of all of the fields</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.309" end="00:33:22.480" style="s2">to know where the current state of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.260" end="00:33:24.039" style="s2">art is of the entire field if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.480" end="00:33:26.110" style="s2">synthesize all the knowledge which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.039" end="00:33:28.410" style="s2">something that is not for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.110" end="00:33:32.830" style="s2">reason commonly done or well done and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.410" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">then being able to see what should our</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:40.210" style="s2">particular space be once we already have</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.500" end="00:33:42.760" style="s2">looked at everything that is known in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.210" end="00:33:46.350" style="s2">that space and what we can abstract from</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.760" end="00:33:50.610" style="s2">all those partial insights together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.350" end="00:33:53.950" style="s2">as you know if you&#39;re doing that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.610" end="00:33:55.990" style="s2">connectomics if you&#39;re doing that in you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.950" end="00:33:59.650" style="s2">know neurogenesis if you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.990" end="00:34:03.400" style="s2">in genomics it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.650" end="00:34:05.260" style="s2">know takes work yeah yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.400" end="00:34:07.960" style="s2">deep it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna cost I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.260" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">to do that to actually pull the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.960" end="00:34:12.940" style="s2">laboratory data together it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">be if you have some interested people</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.940" end="00:34:18.520" style="s2">and some well-trained people and people</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:23.280" style="s2">who are thinking along the same path who</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.520" end="00:34:26.139" style="s2">have the same delightfully curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.280" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">objectives that you have it could happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.139" end="00:34:30.820" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just the question of putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:32.710" style="s2">putting kind of a forgive the grandiose</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.820" end="00:34:34.659" style="s2">expression kind of a new world order of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.710" end="00:34:39.220" style="s2">how do we how do we codify Dada how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.659" end="00:34:42.280" style="s2">we pull it together yeah and the poet&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.220" end="00:34:44.350" style="s2">the others the key part because machine</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.280" end="00:34:45.700" style="s2">learning assessing big data is already</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.350" end="00:34:52.210" style="s2">there and there&#39;s a number of systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.700" end="00:34:54.429" style="s2">doing that but when the interactions are</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.210" end="00:34:56.980" style="s2">as complex as these ones are even</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.429" end="00:34:59.100" style="s2">tremendous amounts of computation don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.980" end="00:35:01.690" style="s2">give us all the insights just via</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.100" end="00:35:04.780" style="s2">computational brute force you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.690" end="00:35:07.109" style="s2">actually develop models you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.780" end="00:35:09.609" style="s2">develop underlying ontology of how this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.109" end="00:35:13.780" style="s2">complex human regulatory system works</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.609" end="00:35:18.730" style="s2">and then be able to utilize those models</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.780" end="00:35:21.250" style="s2">as ways of interpreting the data and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.730" end="00:35:23.060" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.250" end="00:35:25.730" style="s2">of uniquely focused on</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.060" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">sounds so interesting so when you go</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.730" end="00:35:29.930" style="s2">over to the website you have some I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:34.760" style="s2">seen them you have some great videos</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.930" end="00:35:36.380" style="s2">that break down some of this I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.760" end="00:35:38.180" style="s2">been a while since I was over there</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.380" end="00:35:39.650" style="s2">you&#39;re looking like maybe you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.180" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">to think of which video was but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.650" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">seemed to me there was a video that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:46.520" style="s2">saw is like oh my gosh this I had a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:50.030" style="s2">interesting interesting moment and I am</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.520" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">I miss remembering that I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.030" end="00:35:53.810" style="s2">some videos on the site currently I</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we have any speaking</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.810" end="00:35:59.270" style="s2">about the future of say Diagnostics or</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:02.810" style="s2">interpretation like this but we do have</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.270" end="00:36:05.900" style="s2">ones that are discussing why a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.810" end="00:36:09.099" style="s2">science approach is needed and then some</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.900" end="00:36:12.290" style="s2">of how we came up with this particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.099" end="00:36:15.849" style="s2">cognitive enhancement chemistry from a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.290" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">systems theoretic perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.849" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s not only useful for</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:25.220" style="s2">interpreting diagnostic that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:26.980" style="s2">useful building technologies that work</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.220" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">across multiple mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.980" end="00:36:31.250" style="s2">simultaneously and one understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">synergy of those mechanisms so when</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.250" end="00:36:34.700" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about enhancing people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.630" end="00:36:37.240" style="s2">cognitive capability are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.700" end="00:36:39.980" style="s2">about modifying acetylcholine or</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.240" end="00:36:42.859" style="s2">glutamate or dopamine or other</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.980" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">catecholamines or ion channels or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.859" end="00:36:46.580" style="s2">changing the phospholipid membranes or</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:51.109" style="s2">we&#39;re probably talking about all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.580" end="00:36:54.310" style="s2">those things right and so and then with</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.109" end="00:36:58.310" style="s2">acetylcholine are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.310" end="00:37:00.260" style="s2">changing how it gets across the synapse</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.310" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">are we talking about changing how it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.260" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">up taken and the postsynaptic receptor</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:08.540" style="s2">or we and so what we did in that space</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:11.300" style="s2">because there are so many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.540" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">not using adderall via prescription but</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.300" end="00:37:18.080" style="s2">off-label adderall and other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:20.089" style="s2">what you call smart drugs for their</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.080" end="00:37:22.190" style="s2">midterms their finals their tech start</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.089" end="00:37:26.750" style="s2">up where it really does have meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.190" end="00:37:30.380" style="s2">side effects and and even you know Red</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.750" end="00:37:33.770" style="s2">Bull and multiple doses of 300</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.380" end="00:37:36.349" style="s2">milligrams of caffeine with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.770" end="00:37:36.980" style="s2">important to get that both something</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.349" end="00:37:39.650" style="s2">like adderall</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.980" end="00:37:41.500" style="s2">something like the energy drinks will</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.650" end="00:37:44.869" style="s2">enhance a certain element of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.500" end="00:37:46.609" style="s2">productivity and focus while decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.869" end="00:37:48.380" style="s2">statistically known to decrease other</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.609" end="00:37:52.599" style="s2">key elements of cognitive capability</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.380" end="00:37:55.310" style="s2">plus producing dependence plus producing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.599" end="00:37:59.900" style="s2">side effects and so we wanted to see can</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.310" end="00:38:02.810" style="s2">we support people in their desire to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.900" end="00:38:04.990" style="s2">more clear and productive and capable in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.810" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">the presence of ever increasing</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.990" end="00:38:12.890" style="s2">attention distractions in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:15.859" style="s2">more effective and not harmful and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.890" end="00:38:17.420" style="s2">that that required is looking at well</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.859" end="00:38:18.470" style="s2">when people are really seeking cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:21.070" style="s2">enhancement what are they looking for</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.470" end="00:38:23.030" style="s2">and they&#39;re not just looking for focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.070" end="00:38:25.339" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.030" end="00:38:27.650" style="s2">focus and short-term memory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.339" end="00:38:30.710" style="s2">long-term memory and speed of memory and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.650" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">specific memory and digit span and</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.710" end="00:38:35.150" style="s2">verbal fluency and emotional things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:39.410" style="s2">come along with it like emotional</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.150" end="00:38:41.420" style="s2">resilience and connection to drive and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.410" end="00:38:42.859" style="s2">so we kind of from a cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.420" end="00:38:45.260" style="s2">point of view modeled what is everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.859" end="00:38:47.150" style="s2">that people look for there and then we</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.260" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">looked at what is everything known about</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.150" end="00:38:50.540" style="s2">the underlying physiologic pathway is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:52.430" style="s2">known to correlate with each of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.540" end="00:38:56.660" style="s2">subjective States and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.430" end="00:38:59.810" style="s2">capabilities then as character affects</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.660" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">all of those pathways and then start our</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.810" end="00:39:03.650" style="s2">design process from there so that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:07.369" style="s2">know a systems theoretic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.650" end="00:39:10.190" style="s2">works both on may slide design science</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.369" end="00:39:14.540" style="s2">and they interpreting Diagnostics in</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.190" end="00:39:18.619" style="s2">both of those worlds so the question</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.540" end="00:39:20.329" style="s2">then is a guy who practices again this</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.619" end="00:39:24.770" style="s2">is gonna be sort of a proprietary</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.329" end="00:39:29.030" style="s2">question but I&#39;m curious because I use</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.770" end="00:39:32.119" style="s2">testing and I wonder how a person like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.030" end="00:39:35.150" style="s2">you or your team decides which group</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.119" end="00:39:37.339" style="s2">you&#39;re going to use for the tests that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.150" end="00:39:44.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going to acquire so that it could</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.339" end="00:39:46.460" style="s2">have a more diffused body of position so</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.060" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">that so that a number of people can use</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.460" end="00:39:52.730" style="s2">it effectively how do you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:54.200" style="s2">what the laboratory is going to be or</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.730" end="00:39:54.790" style="s2">which laboratories to use how does that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.200" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.790" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">yeah so as far as laboratory testing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">goes I have to make my FDA disclaimer</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.440" style="s2">statement right now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">the future of medicine psychiatry just</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.440" end="00:40:10.970" style="s2">abstractly but as far as neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:14.599" style="s2">goes we don&#39;t have anything to say about</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.970" end="00:40:16.339" style="s2">medicine or psychiatry because we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.599" end="00:40:19.310" style="s2">say anything about that and we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.339" end="00:40:22.099" style="s2">prescribing labs and etc so we just tell</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.310" end="00:40:24.859" style="s2">people to go to a doctor and get those</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.099" end="00:40:27.500" style="s2">done but as far as research in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.859" end="00:40:29.720" style="s2">space coast how do we determine how</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.500" end="00:40:31.310" style="s2">would I determine what I think is a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.720" end="00:40:32.780" style="s2">laboratory test or not well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.310" end="00:40:35.660" style="s2">few things first we have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.780" end="00:40:37.400" style="s2">sensitivity and specificity</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.660" end="00:40:39.230" style="s2">how many false negatives how many false</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.400" end="00:40:42.349" style="s2">positives do we have from that lab by</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.230" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">comparing it to other known best of</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.349" end="00:40:48.589" style="s2">assessments over an appropriate database</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:52.070" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of pretty standard and</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.589" end="00:40:54.320" style="s2">then we have to look at the turnaround</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.070" end="00:40:57.380" style="s2">time for getting the data back we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.320" end="00:40:58.970" style="s2">to look at the cost of it and all other</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.380" end="00:41:00.619" style="s2">aspects of viability and then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.970" end="00:41:06.520" style="s2">look at how relevant the data that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.619" end="00:41:10.210" style="s2">showing us is and and what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.520" end="00:41:12.320" style="s2">interpretive confidence margin around</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.210" end="00:41:15.710" style="s2">clinical applications from that data</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.320" end="00:41:18.260" style="s2">looks like and so you know if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.710" end="00:41:20.119" style="s2">doing parasitology and we really were</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.260" end="00:41:22.010" style="s2">just interested in do we see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.119" end="00:41:24.410" style="s2">parasite right but if we&#39;re doing some</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.010" end="00:41:27.950" style="s2">immunology connected to parasitology and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.410" end="00:41:29.630" style="s2">we&#39;re running CD 57 to say that someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.950" end="00:41:31.970" style="s2">has Lyme&#39;s disease but we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.630" end="00:41:35.150" style="s2">not actually specific to Lyme it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.970" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">be all kinds of infections then a CD 57</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.150" end="00:41:39.140" style="s2">for me means some kind of humoral</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:41.410" style="s2">infection usually and that&#39;s about all</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:43.430" style="s2">it means right so I can use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.410" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">indicator along with many other</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.430" end="00:41:48.830" style="s2">indicators for a complex set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.460" end="00:41:51.800" style="s2">assessments but I have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.830" end="00:41:56.660" style="s2">about my how I interpret that particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.800" end="00:41:58.220" style="s2">metric now as far as the platform that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.660" end="00:42:02.740" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in we want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.220" end="00:42:05.410" style="s2">platform that can upload any tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.740" end="00:42:07.210" style="s2">right so whether someone&#39;s comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.410" end="00:42:09.640" style="s2">stool lab is coming from doctors data or</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.210" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">Genova or whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.640" end="00:42:12.520" style="s2">if the sensitivity and specificity is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.470" end="00:42:13.930" style="s2">known to be high enough to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.520" end="00:42:15.099" style="s2">meaningful confidence margin we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.930" end="00:42:16.900" style="s2">be able to upload any of them and be</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.099" end="00:42:21.190" style="s2">able to run data interpretation across</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.900" end="00:42:24.790" style="s2">them in the future but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.190" end="00:42:27.130" style="s2">important to know that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.790" end="00:42:31.359" style="s2">passionate about developing diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.130" end="00:42:36.670" style="s2">technologies further because when when</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">we want to do complex complex disease</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.670" end="00:42:44.080" style="s2">case solutions in particular I I want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:45.790" style="s2">look at all of the inflammatory markers</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.080" end="00:42:47.050" style="s2">although to me and all the rheumatologic</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.790" end="00:42:49.180" style="s2">markers right I want to look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.050" end="00:42:50.710" style="s2">the kind of nutrient markers I look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.180" end="00:42:51.780" style="s2">all the genetics that I can see oh and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.710" end="00:42:56.320" style="s2">look at all the clinical chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.780" end="00:42:59.290" style="s2">because it ends up being that even some</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.320" end="00:43:00.369" style="s2">of the more obscure things show up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.290" end="00:43:02.050" style="s2">that you wouldn&#39;t have thought to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.369" end="00:43:04.810" style="s2">associated show up in many of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.050" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">difficult cases and non-obvious ways and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.810" end="00:43:08.770" style="s2">so to even say order of operations of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:10.359" style="s2">which diagnosis to do first which to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.770" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">later I&#39;d rather get them all cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.359" end="00:43:15.220" style="s2">all more reliable and be able to just do</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:19.000" style="s2">a lot more data on everybody and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.220" end="00:43:20.830" style="s2">there are kinds of technology that could</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.000" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">make that possible like being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.830" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">metabolomics on mass spectrometry could</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">make metabolomic assessment very cheap</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:31.270" style="s2">and in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:33.430" style="s2">right across 2,500 metabolites be able</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.270" end="00:43:36.310" style="s2">to continuously run those and things</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.430" end="00:43:38.830" style="s2">like you know single drop of blood on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.310" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">technology like gene radar is getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.830" end="00:43:42.099" style="s2">very interesting and the next step</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:44.680" style="s2">beyond that is I think laser</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.099" end="00:43:47.140" style="s2">interferometry where we can test a</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.680" end="00:43:49.330" style="s2">number of elements in the blood just</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.140" end="00:43:52.089" style="s2">through scattering patterns diffraction</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.330" end="00:43:53.770" style="s2">patterns on laser light going in you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.089" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">could imagine if that technology got</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.770" end="00:43:59.619" style="s2">very far that we could testing all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:01.930" style="s2">the biometrics nearly continuously</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.619" end="00:44:04.300" style="s2">running big data on those and you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.930" end="00:44:07.330" style="s2">imagine how much we could learn and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.300" end="00:44:09.910" style="s2">that those are things that we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.330" end="00:44:12.580" style="s2">future of medicine that&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.910" end="00:44:14.050" style="s2">picture because what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.580" end="00:44:16.930" style="s2">about is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.050" end="00:44:19.140" style="s2">measuring you know the things that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.930" end="00:44:23.860" style="s2">you&#39;re measuring are phenomenal because</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.140" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">you&#39;re actually talking about all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.860" end="00:44:30.250" style="s2">of different pieces of the body so to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:36.220" style="s2">speak you know anything from excrement</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.250" end="00:44:38.920" style="s2">to urine to mouth swabs to you know a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.220" end="00:44:40.810" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s a lot of biomedical</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.920" end="00:44:42.190" style="s2">variables in that whole situation that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.810" end="00:44:44.950" style="s2">you were talking about many of which I</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.190" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know about myself because I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.950" end="00:44:50.350" style="s2">a commonplace a practitioner I while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.300" style="s2">listening to you I&#39;m amazed because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.350" end="00:44:54.460" style="s2">thinking of my own self discovery</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.300" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">process while I&#39;m listening to you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.460" end="00:44:59.619" style="s2">how I was going along thinking hey this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:01.510" style="s2">really worked but then it did so then I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.619" end="00:45:03.610" style="s2">went into another level and say oh this</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.510" end="00:45:05.350" style="s2">works but hey here&#39;s another place with</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.610" end="00:45:08.140" style="s2">this new thing that I learned but it</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.350" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so it&#39;s been one long</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.140" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">process for me on a on a personal level</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:14.770" style="s2">of finding these different things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:17.170" style="s2">is why I value speaking to a person like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.770" end="00:45:19.180" style="s2">yourself who has this this depth of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.170" end="00:45:21.880" style="s2">knowledge with these like that whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.180" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">thing is they spectral with the blood</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.880" end="00:45:26.950" style="s2">cell what was that what was that called</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:31.470" style="s2">you had some you&#39;re shootin laser into</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.950" end="00:45:33.700" style="s2">with laser and laser interferometry is</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.470" end="00:45:37.060" style="s2">there&#39;s very little that I can access</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.700" end="00:45:39.910" style="s2">right now and we&#39;re not sure how much</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.060" end="00:45:43.020" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to assess but I I have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.910" end="00:45:45.910" style="s2">hope that the answer will be a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.020" end="00:45:49.000" style="s2">so the deal there is you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.910" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">just putting a beam of light coherent</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.000" end="00:45:55.390" style="s2">light into say your wrist vein and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:56.619" style="s2">it bounces back but based on what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.390" end="00:45:58.510" style="s2">the blood what molecules are in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.619" end="00:46:00.910" style="s2">blood the frequencies of light will</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.510" end="00:46:02.320" style="s2">scatter and they&#39;ll scatter differently</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.910" end="00:46:04.810" style="s2">based on different molecules and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.320" end="00:46:06.850" style="s2">different densities of them so you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.810" end="00:46:08.830" style="s2">tell blood glucose without taking the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.850" end="00:46:10.780" style="s2">drop of blood right but then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.830" end="00:46:14.050" style="s2">question is which molecules in the blood</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.780" end="00:46:15.880" style="s2">could we assess and could it be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.050" end="00:46:19.660" style="s2">more of them and could it be mostly all</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.880" end="00:46:22.750" style="s2">of them and so whether it&#39;s mass spec on</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.660" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">urine doing you know metabolites or</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.750" end="00:46:27.820" style="s2">whether it&#39;s lilies or interferometry or</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:32.080" style="s2">who knows</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.820" end="00:46:34.600" style="s2">biofield assessments I think I think we</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.080" end="00:46:38.440" style="s2">what we know for sure is we will be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.600" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">to get more and more data more often</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.440" end="00:46:43.930" style="s2">more Rubik with ously so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">understand patterns across lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.930" end="00:46:49.990" style="s2">people but even within a single person</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:52.930" style="s2">and as that happens it progressively</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.990" end="00:46:56.320" style="s2">exceeds the ability of individual people</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.930" end="00:46:58.840" style="s2">to understand fully without some aid in</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.320" end="00:47:01.510" style="s2">processing and that&#39;s where as the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.840" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">diagnostic technologies get better the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.510" end="00:47:03.970" style="s2">interpretive technologies need to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:05.620" style="s2">better and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.970" end="00:47:08.380" style="s2">interpretative models that the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.620" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">and people can learn but also processing</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.380" end="00:47:13.840" style="s2">those the data through those models so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:16.840" style="s2">to translate a little bit if you take</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.840" end="00:47:19.830" style="s2">some of these labs like Jen over Great</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.840" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">Plains or whatever you and you find some</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.830" end="00:47:25.420" style="s2">level of confluence of successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:27.090" style="s2">information from them that would just be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.420" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">a piece of what you&#39;re envisioning</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.090" end="00:47:33.610" style="s2">because they would only cover the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">dimension that that lab is skilled at</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.610" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">great right and so you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:41.230" style="s2">number of different you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:42.550" style="s2">not one module that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.230" end="00:47:43.900" style="s2">several different modules it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.550" end="00:47:45.100" style="s2">going to be worked up and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.900" end="00:47:49.360" style="s2">figure out integrate and synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.100" end="00:47:51.430" style="s2">those modules into into one I have one I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.360" end="00:47:54.850" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say one answer but one series</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.430" end="00:47:56.530" style="s2">of answers right so I&#39;m not a I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.850" end="00:47:58.230" style="s2">doctor I&#39;m a researcher but I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.530" end="00:48:00.060" style="s2">with a number of Integrative doctors on</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.230" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.060" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">traditionally incurable cases and where</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:10.450" style="s2">so we looked at what are all the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:12.730" style="s2">that the literature knows is initially</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.450" end="00:48:15.880" style="s2">correlated and then how do we assess for</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.730" end="00:48:18.850" style="s2">those and that would look like I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.880" end="00:48:21.790" style="s2">have a relationship with one lab to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.850" end="00:48:25.860" style="s2">Michael plasmas and another one to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.790" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">viruses and another one to test</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.860" end="00:48:31.090" style="s2">parasitology and protozoa and another</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:34.180" style="s2">one for the best Rheumatology and other</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.090" end="00:48:35.470" style="s2">ones for scans and that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.180" end="00:48:37.360" style="s2">usually several different types for</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.470" end="00:48:38.830" style="s2">different kinds of brain scans and other</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.360" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">ones for me coastal barrier function</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.830" end="00:48:43.779" style="s2">right and other ones for</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:46.749" style="s2">mold and biotoxin information other ones</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.779" end="00:48:49.329" style="s2">for environmental toxins and so what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.749" end="00:48:52.690" style="s2">that means is that&#39;s just so burdensome</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.329" end="00:48:54.579" style="s2">on the clinician and on the office staff</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.690" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">have to set up all those relationships</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.579" end="00:48:59.140" style="s2">send them different places and spin the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:00.940" style="s2">blood this way and etc that we really</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.140" end="00:49:04.869" style="s2">need the field of Diagnostics to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.940" end="00:49:07.299" style="s2">fundamentally better otherwise some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.869" end="00:49:09.099" style="s2">diseases are incurable that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.299" end="00:49:10.390" style="s2">really incurable simply because what it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.099" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">takes to figure them out is too hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.390" end="00:49:17.739" style="s2">that is so true we see that every day I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:20.829" style="s2">mean the the whole spectrum of how you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.739" end="00:49:22.630" style="s2">actually just get the test taking it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.829" end="00:49:25.059" style="s2">requires you know forget managed care</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.630" end="00:49:26.470" style="s2">and answering it to myriads of people in</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.059" end="00:49:30.910" style="s2">managed care who with high school</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.470" end="00:49:32.529" style="s2">education look that is how do you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.910" end="00:49:34.630" style="s2">fill out the paperwork and get that get</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.529" end="00:49:36.099" style="s2">the laboratory information back to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.630" end="00:49:38.170" style="s2">pull it together and then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.099" end="00:49:40.599" style="s2">spend the time to put it together and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.170" end="00:49:43.239" style="s2">get a and and put together a program for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.599" end="00:49:45.160" style="s2">a person yeah it&#39;s great it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.239" end="00:49:47.559" style="s2">difficult right now why are you why</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.160" end="00:49:48.849" style="s2">you&#39;re talking I was thinking about an</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.559" end="00:49:50.469" style="s2">experience I had with some really</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.849" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">interesting neurofeedback people when I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.469" end="00:49:57.039" style="s2">add the office up in DC encephalography</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:50:01.809" style="s2">when you were talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.039" end="00:50:03.670" style="s2">particular technique because even now</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.809" end="00:50:06.809" style="s2">and people out there need to know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.670" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">you could put a band on and shoot red</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.809" end="00:50:12.190" style="s2">infrared spectrums near-infrared hemo</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:14.950" style="s2">encephalopathy you can shoot it right</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.190" end="00:50:16.539" style="s2">through the skull have it bounce out and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.950" end="00:50:18.390" style="s2">get readings on what&#39;s going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.539" end="00:50:21.849" style="s2">oxygenation and the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.390" end="00:50:24.549" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s there that&#39;s here right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.849" end="00:50:26.289" style="s2">now which is and it&#39;s not difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.549" end="00:50:30.819" style="s2">do I mean the technology is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.289" end="00:50:35.259" style="s2">doggone simple to do require I should</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.819" end="00:50:39.039" style="s2">say it&#39;s true well yeah I mean the earth</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.259" end="00:50:41.890" style="s2">near technology is pretty simple easy</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.039" end="00:50:44.289" style="s2">technology and EEG is becoming simple</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.890" end="00:50:49.479" style="s2">enough that home EEG units are actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.289" end="00:50:53.440" style="s2">meaning meaningful data sources and home</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.479" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">HRV units are good and so this is one</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.440" end="00:50:58.780" style="s2">what&#39;s the HRV</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:51:01.810" style="s2">heart rate variability okay and so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.780" end="00:51:06.340" style="s2">which is a major indicator of autonomic</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.810" end="00:51:07.870" style="s2">nervous system and so there it this</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.340" end="00:51:09.970" style="s2">whole field what we call quantified self</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.870" end="00:51:12.070" style="s2">the various kinds of devices that allow</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.970" end="00:51:13.900" style="s2">self measurements I think is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.070" end="00:51:18.130" style="s2">a huge part of the future of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.900" end="00:51:19.840" style="s2">where people take more and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.130" end="00:51:23.740" style="s2">responsibility for their own well-being</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.840" end="00:51:27.400" style="s2">and this means that already people have</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.740" end="00:51:29.650" style="s2">the ability to buy their own supplements</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.400" end="00:51:31.270" style="s2">and you know do a number of their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.650" end="00:51:33.430" style="s2">therapeutic modalities but they also</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.270" end="00:51:36.370" style="s2">they need to be able to track right if</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.430" end="00:51:39.340" style="s2">it if they really want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.370" end="00:51:42.940" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and so I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.340" end="00:51:44.680" style="s2">those are increasing over time because</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.940" end="00:51:46.690" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.680" end="00:51:49.510" style="s2">assessment and then that&#39;ll be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.690" end="00:51:52.990" style="s2">hooked back to your database of hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.510" end="00:51:54.420" style="s2">working or no it&#39;s not and right what do</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.990" end="00:51:57.670" style="s2">we do next</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.420" end="00:51:59.830" style="s2">so this is in the Dreaming phase for us</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.670" end="00:52:01.900" style="s2">in terms of all the things that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.830" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">platform will be able to do but we do</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.900" end="00:52:07.690" style="s2">hope that it gets to the place where we</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.190" style="s2">can do the kinds of complex data</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.690" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">processing we&#39;re talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.190" end="00:52:14.470" style="s2">included then is if there is data</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:15.730" style="s2">missing that we would need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.470" end="00:52:18.760" style="s2">figure it out that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.730" end="00:52:20.350" style="s2">recommend what kind of Diagnostics</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.760" end="00:52:22.810" style="s2">people get we could recommend doctors</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.350" end="00:52:24.460" style="s2">for them to go work within a network but</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.810" end="00:52:26.980" style="s2">we could also be able to recommend which</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.460" end="00:52:29.470" style="s2">of the home assessment technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.980" end="00:52:33.190" style="s2">best from vetting them so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.470" end="00:52:35.140" style="s2">we&#39;re empowering people to have more</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.190" end="00:52:37.660" style="s2">ability to participate in their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.140" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">well-being now that&#39;s a reason for all</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.660" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">of our listeners to go right over to</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:43.870" style="s2">neuro hacker and get hooked up</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:47.290" style="s2">immediately because they need to be on</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.870" end="00:52:49.960" style="s2">your list right now because if you then</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.290" end="00:52:54.100" style="s2">have next week or next month or next</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.960" end="00:52:56.560" style="s2">year some way of beginning this process</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.100" end="00:52:58.900" style="s2">of measurement that you folks have</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.560" end="00:53:01.810" style="s2">signed off on that you think is going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.900" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">be valid and useful then they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.810" end="00:53:05.890" style="s2">there I mean our whole audience this</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:07.320" style="s2">ours is a small audience I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.890" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">a bigger audience out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.320" end="00:53:11.980" style="s2">curious about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:13.570" style="s2">I think anybody that ever listens to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:14.980" style="s2">this should be just immediately hooked</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.570" end="00:53:17.470" style="s2">up with neuro hacker I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.980" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">enthusiastic about having had the chance</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.470" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">to speak with you because what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:24.520" style="s2">talking about is where we&#39;re I think so</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:26.920" style="s2">many people want to be but don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.520" end="00:53:29.470" style="s2">how to get there myself included I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.920" end="00:53:32.500" style="s2">you know you know it&#39;s it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.470" end="00:53:34.180" style="s2">interesting place to be and to even</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.500" end="00:53:36.190" style="s2">envision the possibilities are there</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.180" end="00:53:38.230" style="s2">because the mind is seem you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.190" end="00:53:39.850" style="s2">completely out there it&#39;s just we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.230" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">even talk about it it&#39;s just over our</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.850" end="00:53:42.460" style="s2">heads nothing to talk about all these</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:47.830" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.460" end="00:53:51.400" style="s2">IgG is still complex if as mundane is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.830" end="00:53:53.500" style="s2">that simple test is a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.400" end="00:53:55.990" style="s2">a belief system to some you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.500" end="00:53:57.940" style="s2">still it&#39;s this Galileo moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.990" end="00:53:59.770" style="s2">the Sun is rotating around Rome I know</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.940" end="00:54:03.190" style="s2">it is I can see it is so we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.770" end="00:54:04.470" style="s2">to worry about that and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.190" end="00:54:07.120" style="s2">what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.470" end="00:54:08.980" style="s2">so we really do have to close Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.120" end="00:54:10.150" style="s2">really I know you&#39;re a little bit under</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.980" end="00:54:11.740" style="s2">the weather and I can&#39;t tell you how</p>

<p begin="00:54:18.730" end="00:54:23.160" style="s2">because why because people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.680" end="00:54:26.070" style="s2">have to listen to it more than once</p>
