<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">idea oh you know what happened</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">we create a better world together how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:50.270" style="s2">actually create the infrastructure the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">system that we need your cute couple oh</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">makes sense</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">channel called Jubilee saves the world</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:20.930" style="s2">that is figuring how do I create the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">technology together and work together to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.930" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">create projects that have meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">that about anything you want to add to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">that I can&#39;t think of like a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">longer version it&#39;s either that or</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">talking for five minutes oh no it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">okay cool so during the pandemic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">tons of people who are doing art and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">singing and playing and dancing and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">love it and that&#39;s not what I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">into the world I&#39;m participating in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">because it fuels my soul but what I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">I can give the world is a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:04.310" style="s2">and a ideas that actually generate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">change that bring us together and create</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.310" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">solutions that matter and so that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">what I have been involved in that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">together tech is involved in and in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:18.700" style="s2">I want everyone to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:21.730" style="s2">participate and everyone meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.700" end="00:02:24.130" style="s2">audience to be able to be part of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.730" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">does that look like for you because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.130" end="00:02:29.080" style="s2">can&#39;t yet with the current technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:32.020" style="s2">work with dozens or hundreds of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.080" end="00:02:33.850" style="s2">to create it but we can all have</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.020" end="00:02:36.190" style="s2">feedback on what that actually looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.850" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">like how do we create on the fly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.190" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">thing that we work that we can work</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">through as a group however big that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:49.690" style="s2">group is while we&#39;re the group we are so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:56.140" style="s2">always looking to to bring in more</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.690" end="00:02:58.960" style="s2">people and so where do we go from there</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:03:00.610" style="s2">we have that is the slightly bigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.960" end="00:03:02.350" style="s2">picture I will tell you what I am up to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.610" end="00:03:06.820" style="s2">its solution raising what we&#39;ve been up</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.350" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">to a solution raising and then we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.820" end="00:03:10.180" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what happens after that unless</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">a drill you have something else you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.180" end="00:03:13.210" style="s2">would like to I don&#39;t have different</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:14.710" style="s2">co-hosts different people joining me</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.210" end="00:03:16.570" style="s2">because this is a lot for anyone to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.710" end="00:03:18.940" style="s2">every night so having the same person</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.570" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">joined every night but anyone is welcome</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.940" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">to be a co-host as long as here you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:28.420" style="s2">we&#39;re working through the world should</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:32.110" style="s2">not necessarily individual but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.420" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know we&#39;re gonna see we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.110" end="00:03:39.580" style="s2">let it unfold well we figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.840" end="00:03:44.709" style="s2">great possibility and pandemic fix the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.580" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">world Friday&#39;s all the hype um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.709" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">gonna need to keep me on track dater all</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">I&#39;m also not smoking pot during the day</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:53.950" style="s2">and my brother is agreed to join me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:57.970" style="s2">I bumped pot right before we came on</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.950" end="00:04:02.800" style="s2">because it generates ideas and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.970" end="00:04:05.709" style="s2">reward for a day Hyundai always a day</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.800" end="00:04:07.000" style="s2">solution raising is I&#39;m so glad I took</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.709" end="00:04:08.350" style="s2">notes because then I just keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.000" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">brought back without actually get you to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.350" end="00:04:15.310" style="s2">the point so hard to know why this</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been successful yet but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.310" end="00:04:21.340" style="s2"> awesome so let&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">okay so I don&#39;t need to give a history</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.340" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">right we&#39;re solution raising came from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not the most important</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:28.810" style="s2">thing so crazy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:31.449" style="s2">we get together for an hour and within</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.810" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">an hour we come up with a potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.449" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">feasible feasible solution to a sector</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:42.010" style="s2">to a topic to a I don&#39;t know a thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:44.530" style="s2">that we want to talk about I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.010" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">sector kind of work so that&#39;s it gives</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.530" end="00:04:50.260" style="s2">me sort of that high-level yeah so when</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:51.850" style="s2">we might get more into the focus but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.260" end="00:04:53.760" style="s2">point is to have a more broad topic so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.850" end="00:04:56.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about education food</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.760" end="00:05:00.070" style="s2">infectious disease community</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.620" end="00:05:02.530" style="s2">transportation and labor and during that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.070" end="00:05:09.460" style="s2">hour we spend about 15 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.530" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">about what the world looks like now what</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.460" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">is working and mainly what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:17.949" style="s2">we don&#39;t focus on that area because</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what all we talk about is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.949" end="00:05:22.030" style="s2">wrong maybe have a little more of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">on this current brand-new catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.030" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">but right now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:31.180" style="s2">education we know what the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:33.630" style="s2">then we spend 15 minutes talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.180" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">what our ideal future would look like</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.630" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">individually in our perfect future for</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.789" style="s2">that topic and then we spend 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">coming up with together something we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.789" end="00:05:50.979" style="s2">actually could do right now if we had</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 and are</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.979" end="00:05:59.080" style="s2">creating a solution that is enticing</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">that isn&#39;t pushing one agenda on</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.080" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s like creating a solution</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:05.530" style="s2">for ourselves and inviting the world and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:07.000" style="s2">sometimes I mention that&#39;s people we</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.530" end="00:06:09.099" style="s2">call it with that sometimes I mention it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:11.139" style="s2">we don&#39;t go up with it you know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.099" end="00:06:14.050" style="s2">saying forget to mention it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.139" end="00:06:17.160" style="s2">mainly just than 10,000 people $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.050" end="00:06:20.260" style="s2">so we&#39;ve conducted six of them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.160" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">they&#39;ve been amazing different I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.260" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">all the ladies participate in every</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:28.360" style="s2">single one of them Adriel you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">participated in two or three two and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.360" end="00:06:35.460" style="s2">then I think we attempted a third but</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:35.460" style="s2">there was no one at it so - okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.480" end="00:06:45.050" style="s2">and so I say on and so a lot just uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:46.820" style="s2">coming um I&#39;m gonna talk about what a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.050" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">brief solution we came up with in each</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.820" end="00:06:50.890" style="s2">of them and then you know maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:53.390" style="s2">move in the world together where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.890" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">we&#39;re done all of that right and if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.390" end="00:06:56.570" style="s2">want to jump in well I mean well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:07:00.860" style="s2">telling about these different things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:03.410" style="s2">mention something then go for it so for</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.860" end="00:07:07.310" style="s2">education after our hour we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.410" end="00:07:11.450" style="s2">organizing existing videos online and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.310" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">existing his content online to be able</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.450" end="00:07:20.600" style="s2">to learn something or gain different</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:23.390" style="s2">skill levels and our main focus was</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.600" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">gonna be on catering that to learning</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.390" end="00:07:28.370" style="s2">styles as it was the most powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">we could do so basically just creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.370" end="00:07:33.980" style="s2">catalogs for various learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:35.030" style="s2">online is something we could do with ten</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.980" end="00:07:38.210" style="s2">thousand people a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.030" end="00:07:42.110" style="s2">dollars then during the food one we</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.210" end="00:07:44.540" style="s2">talked about an app that would help you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.110" end="00:07:49.850" style="s2">grow food feed that information back</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.540" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">into the system using a lot of existing</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.850" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">tech like Google Maps and sunrise sunset</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:58.030" style="s2">geography I mean I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">what&#39;s possible but creating a gardening</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.030" end="00:08:02.150" style="s2">purchasing coordinating with your</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">neighbors and especially recipe sure</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.150" end="00:08:10.940" style="s2">with a grocery list a shopping list for</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:14.420" style="s2">infectious disease we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.940" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">having a way to safely share your data</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.420" end="00:08:19.970" style="s2">so that we we could work together to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:22.010" style="s2">things like map the spread and warn</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.970" end="00:08:24.320" style="s2">people and work through you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.010" end="00:08:29.510" style="s2">operating okay helping people with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.320" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">quarantine as well as the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.510" end="00:08:32.780" style="s2">having trustworthy information during a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:34.340" style="s2">period like that so having something</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.780" end="00:08:38.630" style="s2">that is somewhere you can have a go-to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.340" end="00:08:41.390" style="s2">for trust for the information for</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.630" end="00:08:42.979" style="s2">community we talked about we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.390" end="00:08:44.540" style="s2">talking about the physical communities</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.979" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">that people want to be part of that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.540" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">live and eaten</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.190" end="00:08:56.060" style="s2">maybe work with but more just live</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.890" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">together both say that and we went</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.060" end="00:08:59.390" style="s2">through various solutions but we ended</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:02.120" style="s2">up talking about this really cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.390" end="00:09:06.470" style="s2">of having a platform that facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.120" end="00:09:07.580" style="s2">you to have a group of 100 having a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.470" end="00:09:10.550" style="s2">hundred groups of a hundred each</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.580" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">different group working on a bigger meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.550" end="00:09:17.950" style="s2">problem for communities in general like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:21.770" style="s2">food sovereignty or having visitors</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.950" end="00:09:24.230" style="s2">child care during the day right like any</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.770" end="00:09:26.210" style="s2">kind of problem that you&#39;re gonna want</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.230" end="00:09:29.060" style="s2">to solve together as a community is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.210" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">more effective having you get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.060" end="00:09:32.450" style="s2">which group you&#39;re in you have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.980" style="s2">teams of 100 and then at the end let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.450" end="00:09:35.810" style="s2">say there&#39;s a hundred doctors who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">part of it and there are in one team to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.810" end="00:09:39.950" style="s2">figure out the medical system of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:41.690" style="s2">own communities and how to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.950" end="00:09:43.880" style="s2">then they&#39;re also connected to 99 other</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.690" end="00:09:47.950" style="s2">doctors and creating a platform in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.880" end="00:09:53.090" style="s2">like I just really liked that idea and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.950" end="00:09:54.680" style="s2">find your people space work that part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.090" end="00:09:57.590" style="s2">that is finding the groups that work</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.680" end="00:10:01.640" style="s2">well together finding in either a set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.590" end="00:10:03.050" style="s2">skill sets that come together or in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.640" end="00:10:04.190" style="s2">case a common purpose that they come</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.050" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">under that they&#39;re all trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.190" end="00:10:12.380" style="s2">plumbing and community furniture people</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:13.820" style="s2">space oh and to be so and also as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.380" end="00:10:16.040" style="s2">community to be able to work through</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.820" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">what actually takes to start a community</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.040" end="00:10:21.050" style="s2">so all those the problems but also like</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.940" style="s2">getting through your cities or areas</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.050" end="00:10:25.010" style="s2">regulations I&#39;m like can you buy land</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.940" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">can you build on it is it to code is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.010" end="00:10:29.990" style="s2">to figuring out that process and be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">to share that with each other as a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.990" end="00:10:35.000" style="s2">I know thank Hoover going through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.120" end="00:10:36.830" style="s2">one to build the I&#39;m part of definitely</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.000" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">has a lot to share on what it is to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.830" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">through the Vancouver process and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">don&#39;t have that yet then you have access</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">to other people who are also</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:48.830" style="s2">brainstorming for that same place so</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what we came up for community for</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.830" end="00:10:55.580" style="s2">transportation we talked about a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:56.870" style="s2">different things but but a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.580" end="00:10:58.190" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily filled it&#39;s feasible</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.870" end="00:11:02.750" style="s2">with we have kind of thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.190" end="00:11:04.819" style="s2">and 10,000 people two of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.750" end="00:11:10.699" style="s2">stood out to me for the hub which was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.819" end="00:11:12.709" style="s2">an idea where you create stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.699" end="00:11:15.649" style="s2">various locations whether that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.709" end="00:11:17.689" style="s2">home your office your studio and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.649" end="00:11:19.490" style="s2">shipped to every week and shipped to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.689" end="00:11:21.560" style="s2">hub and then it&#39;s like kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.490" end="00:11:23.149" style="s2">heartbeat stuff comes in and stuff goes</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.560" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">out to everyone and it can happen daily</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.149" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">it can happen so it&#39;s it&#39;s about just</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:29.300" style="s2">redistribute it within that region so</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:31.610" style="s2">being able to make soup in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.300" end="00:11:33.589" style="s2">you know in your house and you not want</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.610" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">to know that people like a marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.589" end="00:11:42.019" style="s2">slash hub and creating the delivery</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:45.319" style="s2">system and stuff and that we something</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.019" end="00:11:47.269" style="s2">be really cool during this pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.319" end="00:11:50.139" style="s2">it&#39;s also just shipping things to people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.269" end="00:11:52.939" style="s2">but also figuring out is it safe can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.139" end="00:11:55.129" style="s2">how do we track it whatever not quite so</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.939" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">that&#39;s the transportation then for labor</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.129" end="00:12:01.670" style="s2">we talked about with this solution of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">platform that helps you coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.670" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">volunteers that people want to be do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:09.949" style="s2">want to be helping and so to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:13.209" style="s2">facilitate that process from</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.949" end="00:12:16.220" style="s2">organizations and from startups is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.209" end="00:12:17.509" style="s2">powerful especially since we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.220" end="00:12:23.170" style="s2">about together tech having it be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.509" end="00:12:25.370" style="s2">central um I lost my champ out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.170" end="00:12:28.879" style="s2">something somebody talked about together</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.370" end="00:12:30.889" style="s2">tech labor so he oh and as well as one</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.879" end="00:12:34.459" style="s2">of the other options for labor was a was</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.889" end="00:12:36.649" style="s2">a I don&#39;t have it down here</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.459" end="00:12:38.269" style="s2">winner is like TaskRabbit and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.649" end="00:12:40.209" style="s2">called the I want to say piecemeal</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.269" end="00:12:45.980" style="s2">economy but I can&#39;t remember with that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.209" end="00:12:49.430" style="s2">work sharing no okay gig economy yes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.980" end="00:12:51.379" style="s2">gig economy having a labor platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.430" end="00:12:53.689" style="s2">right where you&#39;re able to see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.379" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">transparency of what that is how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.689" end="00:12:56.420" style="s2">the person is getting paid how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">make sure the workers are getting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.420" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">best well people are getting the best</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">deal how do you actually facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:04.790" style="s2">process and by coordinating on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.290" style="s2">platform does most of the work for them</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.790" end="00:13:09.019" style="s2">so most of the labor can be directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.290" end="00:13:11.630" style="s2">paid and not you know you spend 10 hours</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.019" end="00:13:13.490" style="s2">to find 10 hours of cleaning it actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.630" end="00:13:16.520" style="s2">just they you know facilitating to help</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.490" end="00:13:19.730" style="s2">you find it and so those were the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.520" end="00:13:22.310" style="s2">six topics that we covered and created</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.730" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">different solutions and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.310" end="00:13:26.840" style="s2">solutions are things that at least in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:29.330" style="s2">minimized version is something you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.840" end="00:13:34.070" style="s2">create with 10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.330" end="00:13:36.830" style="s2">and it&#39;s about figuring out that process</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.070" end="00:13:38.780" style="s2">of how do you find 10,000 people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.830" end="00:13:40.340" style="s2">then give $10 per 100 thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.780" end="00:13:42.470" style="s2">or we crowdfund together and find a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.340" end="00:13:44.270" style="s2">different way to make money but you also</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.470" end="00:13:46.400" style="s2">need a threshold of people all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.270" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">things also don&#39;t work if only 12 people</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.400" end="00:13:49.490" style="s2">are using them</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">most of these they have to be something</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.490" end="00:13:57.110" style="s2">that many people want to use and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:58.400" style="s2">coordinate together so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.110" end="00:13:59.900" style="s2">not gonna say focusing on this so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.400" end="00:14:01.790" style="s2">gonna now hold the solution raising on</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.900" end="00:14:03.890" style="s2">solution raising itself and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.790" end="00:14:06.410" style="s2">that how do we find how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.890" end="00:14:09.050" style="s2">10,000 people how do we get $200,000 but</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.410" end="00:14:11.510" style="s2">if we can finding out a way for this</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.050" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">space to be part of that where people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.510" end="00:14:15.050" style="s2">are able to contribute I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:16.310" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.050" end="00:14:17.780" style="s2">maybe someone else has that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.310" end="00:14:20.510" style="s2">contribute what does it look like to</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.879" end="00:18:43.029" style="s2">ace a supply line to maximize profits</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.730" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">while making it fragile as hell yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.029" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m able to explain this</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:52.779" style="s2">profit versus purpose in our current</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:55.619" style="s2">economy we&#39;ve maximized profit but with</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.779" end="00:18:57.669" style="s2">competition so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.619" end="00:19:00.549" style="s2">different actors competing within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.669" end="00:19:03.549" style="s2">same market and because of marketing</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.549" end="00:19:05.320" style="s2">costs because just an off well the cost</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.549" end="00:19:07.509" style="s2">that comes into competition right that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.320" end="00:19:11.110" style="s2">did we all need to run our own place we</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.509" end="00:19:14.230" style="s2">all need to do our own secret R&amp;D and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.110" end="00:19:19.029" style="s2">try to compete each other there is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.230" end="00:19:21.399" style="s2">they get as close to like the edge as</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.029" end="00:19:22.779" style="s2">possible for not being profitable</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.399" end="00:19:25.450" style="s2">they&#39;re taking them up like the highest</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.779" end="00:19:27.190" style="s2">risk in order to be able to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.450" end="00:19:29.710" style="s2">other people who are doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.190" end="00:19:32.470" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve maximized for profit but</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.710" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">within a competitive marketplace where</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.470" end="00:19:38.730" style="s2">that competition has a benefits but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:38.730" style="s2">also comes at a cost</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.090" end="00:19:47.259" style="s2">the other option there&#39;s many options</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.759" end="00:19:49.269" style="s2">but is to create for maximum purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.259" end="00:19:52.090" style="s2">which I believe we can almost always do</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.269" end="00:19:53.470" style="s2">together better because you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.090" end="00:19:55.029" style="s2">the competition to come up with the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.470" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">thing if you have a different system</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.029" end="00:20:00.070" style="s2">they can come up with with a best thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:01.420" style="s2">better than the current one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.070" end="00:20:03.190" style="s2">maximising for profit</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:05.380" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have to be the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.190" end="00:20:07.990" style="s2">you have to be the most profitable which</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.380" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">is not the same creating a system where</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.990" end="00:20:13.600" style="s2">you are the best because you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:15.040" style="s2">at including everyone in creating a</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.580" end="00:20:24.429" style="s2">risk and figuring out how to like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.870" end="00:20:25.720" style="s2">don&#39;t really have competition right</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.429" end="00:20:27.309" style="s2">because you&#39;re not trying to market</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.720" end="00:20:28.090" style="s2">you&#39;re just like how do we solve this</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.780" end="00:20:39.970" style="s2">will go out and spread the word because</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.250" end="00:20:41.470" style="s2">it solves it for them and yeah under my</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.970" end="00:20:46.390" style="s2">point that once but profit versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.470" end="00:20:49.300" style="s2">purpose that that is how we create</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.390" end="00:20:51.190" style="s2">solutions is by focusing on the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.300" end="00:20:54.520" style="s2">together instead of the profit which</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.190" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">currently is what the system is based on</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.520" end="00:20:59.170" style="s2">and it gives us what we currently have</p>

<p begin="00:21:45.850" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">word like the feedback is very rapid we</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:53.500" style="s2">do they when you do something wrong you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:21:55.030" style="s2">can see what happens by looking at at</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.500" end="00:21:57.910" style="s2">Italy and it didn&#39;t go wrong for very</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.030" end="00:22:00.940" style="s2">long they did you know he didn&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.910" end="00:22:02.679" style="s2">that long to lock things down they made</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.940" end="00:22:04.540" style="s2">the decision then the world the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.679" end="00:22:08.350" style="s2">the world had to as well like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.540" end="00:22:09.510" style="s2">what is going toughen what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.350" end="00:22:11.800" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.510" end="00:22:13.900" style="s2">they&#39;re busy dealing with that when</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.800" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">have no capacity to do to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.900" end="00:22:19.060" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what to do they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:20.230" style="s2">even understand the economy as it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.060" end="00:22:24.040" style="s2">running really</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.230" end="00:22:26.260" style="s2">so understanding something that is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.040" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">complex and basically runs itself for</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.260" end="00:22:29.980" style="s2">profit and only for profit so when you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:32.410" style="s2">take profit out it doesn&#39;t run itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.980" end="00:22:36.220" style="s2">but we can see this new thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.410" end="00:22:38.440" style="s2">emerging of people taking ownership</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.220" end="00:22:40.930" style="s2">using the tools they have using Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.440" end="00:22:42.190" style="s2">starting groups of how do we support</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.930" end="00:22:43.510" style="s2">each other how do we get our neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.190" end="00:22:45.400" style="s2">food how do we do but these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.510" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.400" end="00:22:51.040" style="s2">do it took days two weeks to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:52.660" style="s2">right like you keep knowing three months</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.040" end="00:22:54.010" style="s2">ago it was like okay this pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.660" end="00:22:56.200" style="s2">gonna hit we&#39;re gonna have this happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.010" end="00:22:58.660" style="s2">and so we need to have these things in</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.200" end="00:23:00.490" style="s2">place it&#39;s happening on the fly and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.660" end="00:23:02.410" style="s2">more we can create a system to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.490" end="00:23:06.280" style="s2">these kind of things on the fly so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.410" end="00:23:08.170" style="s2">can work together the better off the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.280" end="00:23:09.670" style="s2">better off we are so what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.170" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">like how do we create that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.670" end="00:23:15.730" style="s2">fund it together how do we work through</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:17.770" style="s2">that process in a way that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.730" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">trust the outcome we&#39;re gonna trust the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.770" end="00:23:21.490" style="s2">product that comes out of that right how</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:25.090" style="s2">open is that process does this look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.490" end="00:23:26.650" style="s2">us creating that where they grew a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.090" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">smaller group of people with people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.650" end="00:23:31.350" style="s2">commenting and spitballing ideas and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:34.230" style="s2">know working together does it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.350" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">create a democratic system we can create</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.230" end="00:23:38.260" style="s2">literally anything because roots doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:41.170" style="s2">mean it&#39;s gonna be the thing that stays</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.260" end="00:23:43.780" style="s2">it&#39;s just playing with it in our hands</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.170" end="00:23:46.630" style="s2">and then eventually trying something</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.780" end="00:23:51.430" style="s2">when it&#39;s less risky which literally</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.630" end="00:23:54.270" style="s2">anything&#39;s less risky no as long as</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.430" end="00:23:59.580" style="s2">we&#39;re staying inside solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.270" end="00:24:01.450" style="s2">everything&#39;s less risky now and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.580" end="00:24:02.740" style="s2">everything that we have to figure out we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.450" end="00:24:04.290" style="s2">self it figure it anyway we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.740" end="00:24:09.070" style="s2">figure out how people&#39;s rent gets paid</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.290" end="00:24:10.600" style="s2">while there can&#39;t work it&#39;s a large</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.070" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">fraction of the populations like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.600" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">how do you get your medicine how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:14.740" style="s2">get your food how do you stay home how</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:16.810" style="s2">do you deal with your family I live day</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.740" end="00:24:19.300" style="s2">in and day out basis how do you you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.810" end="00:24:20.830" style="s2">deal with any of that and we can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.300" end="00:24:22.990" style="s2">dealing with that stuff what could that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.830" end="00:24:25.590" style="s2">look like and we could be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.990" end="00:24:30.510" style="s2">the bigger future we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:32.010" style="s2">wanna create together herbicide it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.510" end="00:24:33.419" style="s2">just gonna be me talking to myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.010" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2">still easier having a second person</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.419" end="00:24:43.500" style="s2">because I have sound wardens somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:47.250" style="s2">sort of looking for co-hosts for for all</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.500" end="00:24:49.110" style="s2">of these oh the time periods great well</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.250" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">you know I&#39;d love although that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.110" end="00:24:53.010" style="s2">less for you guys and totally for me is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.059" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">I really love exploited the technology</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.010" end="00:24:57.059" style="s2">cooperative idea to people and having</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:58.770" style="s2">them pick holes part like who haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.059" end="00:25:00.120" style="s2">heard about it before right right they</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.770" end="00:25:02.399" style="s2">kind of ask the same questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.120" end="00:25:04.470" style="s2">it helps that was actually I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.399" end="00:25:13.020" style="s2">do up like that&#39;s not a real idea for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.470" end="00:25:15.149" style="s2">blog partner what&#39;s Rogan yeah so having</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.020" end="00:25:19.770" style="s2">a podcast but every episode is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.149" end="00:25:25.890" style="s2">interview like that&#39;s maybe not the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.770" end="00:25:29.460" style="s2">interesting but I like two weeks ago I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.890" end="00:25:31.169" style="s2">had Edward on the one of these things</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.460" end="00:25:33.450" style="s2">for wiki election and that was like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.169" end="00:25:34.950" style="s2">best one I&#39;ve done by far oh cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.450" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">no it&#39;s so much easier having another</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.950" end="00:25:40.890" style="s2">person and being real and be like ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:43.350" style="s2">questions as I&#39;m going you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.890" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">explaining things and so we&#39;re possibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.350" end="00:25:47.010" style="s2">somebody in the audience has questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">you can get an actual question in we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.010" end="00:25:49.890" style="s2">sort of ended up going through</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.760" end="00:25:53.580" style="s2">everything and it was a long one but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.890" end="00:25:55.620" style="s2">was good like it was yeah it was very</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.580" end="00:25:57.000" style="s2">happy I did afterwards and now I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.620" end="00:25:58.860" style="s2">I kind of want more people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.000" end="00:26:00.330" style="s2">participate and sort of doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.860" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">thing where it&#39;s like here&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.330" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">topic is the project and the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">just to get a bunch of feedback did you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:09.990" style="s2">explain it you know the different</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:12.169" style="s2">aspects of it and then to get feedback</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.990" end="00:26:15.620" style="s2">and sort of a constant iteration of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.169" end="00:26:18.600" style="s2">improving your ability to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.620" end="00:26:20.520" style="s2">yeah absolutely except that I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.600" end="00:26:23.700" style="s2">I can&#39;t consciously learn it it has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.520" end="00:26:25.289" style="s2">be like muscle memory we people to do an</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.700" end="00:26:26.250" style="s2">esky the same path to got it again</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.289" end="00:26:30.169" style="s2">alright</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.250" end="00:26:33.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been building a Google slides</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.169" end="00:26:35.429" style="s2">document like in each session I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.270" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">kind of go through it you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.429" end="00:26:42.270" style="s2">three sections four sections so I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:45.480" style="s2">between topics rooks okay feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.270" end="00:26:49.230" style="s2">can&#39;t do that for like the bigger tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.480" end="00:26:51.300" style="s2">cooperative but I think I can do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.230" end="00:26:53.309" style="s2">for every individual project my brother</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.300" end="00:26:55.050" style="s2">my braid sparks be like hey like</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.309" end="00:26:59.250" style="s2">solution raising right I can do that for</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.050" end="00:27:00.600" style="s2">a solution because the big tech project</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.250" end="00:27:04.800" style="s2">is what we&#39;re creating together from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.600" end="00:27:06.300" style="s2">baby from the seed so I have my idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.800" end="00:27:08.730" style="s2">what it looks like but doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.300" end="00:27:11.960" style="s2">that right it looks like what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.730" end="00:27:11.960" style="s2">thing we can do what&#39;s the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.010" end="00:27:18.059" style="s2">like this can be so much fun to create</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.570" end="00:27:20.670" style="s2">together but people have to get through</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.059" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">the slightly shitty or part of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.670" end="00:27:27.630" style="s2">current crisis first yeah but that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.870" end="00:27:29.280" style="s2">actually know people need like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.630" end="00:27:32.520" style="s2">gonna need to takes a few days to a week</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.280" end="00:27:35.280" style="s2">to two weeks to like sit in it and be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.520" end="00:27:37.320" style="s2">with it but if we can meet people where</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.280" end="00:27:38.850" style="s2">they are and have people actually part</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:41.100" style="s2">of the project in their current</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.850" end="00:27:43.200" style="s2">emotional state like that&#39;s part of why</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.100" end="00:27:45.809" style="s2">I&#39;m doing this from 6 to 640 every night</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:48.660" style="s2">is there&#39;s gonna be days where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.809" end="00:27:51.410" style="s2">comment I&#39;m better or worse oh people</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.660" end="00:27:54.840" style="s2">people I&#39;m gonna put it up this is read</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.410" end="00:28:01.170" style="s2">these ideas or exchange existing company</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.840" end="00:28:03.570" style="s2">ideas or both what it would take a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.170" end="00:28:06.500" style="s2">well we&#39;re there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.570" end="00:28:08.700" style="s2">happening so how do you things happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.500" end="00:28:11.070" style="s2">we&#39;re creating the tech Walker team</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.700" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">together and trying to find out other</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.070" end="00:28:17.670" style="s2">projects to bring on board to say how</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">did how do we how are we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.670" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">create something together that actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:24.179" style="s2">facilitates us as individuals and us as</p>

<p begin="00:28:24.179" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">project is solution raising which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.890" end="00:28:32.070" style="s2">what I went through for the first 10 15</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:33.450" style="s2">minutes of what solution raising is and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.070" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">what we came up with together</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.450" end="00:28:36.600" style="s2">over the course of I guess six hours</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:41.220" style="s2">because there are six different</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.600" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">conversations and so I&#39;m here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.220" end="00:28:45.450" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing in the world outside of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">being here from 6 to 640 hey Charles</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.450" end="00:28:52.530" style="s2">creating a collection and I don&#39;t did I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:56.730" style="s2">answer the question it&#39;s the others then</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.530" end="00:28:58.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t I mean the vibe I get from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.730" end="00:29:00.600" style="s2">question is sort of what&#39;s the best way</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.500" end="00:29:02.130" style="s2">to do it and I think it&#39;s just everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.600" end="00:29:04.830" style="s2">does what they think the best thing will</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.130" end="00:29:05.820" style="s2">be so we&#39;re doing a co-op other people</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.830" end="00:29:07.590" style="s2">will try to change the existing</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.820" end="00:29:10.140" style="s2">infrastructure and prove how companies</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.590" end="00:29:12.780" style="s2">operate you know and possibly make them</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.140" end="00:29:17.270" style="s2">a bit more resilient to these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.780" end="00:29:20.250" style="s2">issues and then we see what shakes OH</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.270" end="00:29:23.370" style="s2">like our world&#39;s not going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.250" end="00:29:25.650" style="s2">way cows back to the way it was I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.370" end="00:29:27.180" style="s2">think maybe a little more for dooming</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.650" end="00:29:28.770" style="s2">boomer like I think things are a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.180" end="00:29:29.550" style="s2">worse than they are in some ways and a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.770" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">little better than they are in other</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.550" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">ways but a lot of the jobs aren&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.380" style="s2">be there when we go back so we still</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:39.870" style="s2">have to figure out how to run an economy</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.380" end="00:29:43.170" style="s2">when we have a huge workforce not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.870" end="00:29:44.610" style="s2">working and that also there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.170" end="00:29:46.680" style="s2">jobs we actually don&#39;t need in our</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.610" end="00:29:47.850" style="s2">economy they&#39;re not the essential ones</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.680" end="00:29:49.380" style="s2">they aren&#39;t the things that kept it</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.850" end="00:29:50.790" style="s2">going and that&#39;s what we&#39;re also like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.380" end="00:29:52.050" style="s2">our governments are kind of figuring</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.790" end="00:29:53.790" style="s2">that out they&#39;re figuring out what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.050" end="00:29:58.170" style="s2">the essential part what is here</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.790" end="00:30:03.930" style="s2">well we deal with something that is huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.170" end="00:30:05.310" style="s2">and yet not the worst this could be so</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.930" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">much worse than it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.310" end="00:30:09.420" style="s2">and it could not be happening but then</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:13.650" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t have our mini apocalypse to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.420" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">learn from ah yeah I know on periscope</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.650" end="00:30:18.270" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like that we&#39;re on um both</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:19.800" style="s2">periscope and YouTube I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.270" end="00:30:21.660" style="s2">every night the idea is hopefully people</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.800" end="00:30:23.910" style="s2">will be joining and participating and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.660" end="00:30:26.040" style="s2">getting more of an idea I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.910" end="00:30:28.140" style="s2">know if anyone participating occupy the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.040" end="00:30:31.230" style="s2">Occupy movement but they have like two</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.140" end="00:30:32.790" style="s2">meetings a day where nothing really got</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.230" end="00:30:34.290" style="s2">done because everyone had to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.790" end="00:30:35.580" style="s2">everything had to get voted on and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.290" end="00:30:39.270" style="s2">weren&#39;t out the last ones who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.580" end="00:30:40.530" style="s2">know what was going on but couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.270" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">figure out we&#39;re gonna figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.530" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">do something together here or have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:47.970" style="s2">conversation as generative or talk about</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:49.800" style="s2">big lofty ideas that we never quite get</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.970" end="00:30:52.110" style="s2">to but then you know figure out just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.800" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">like the next little piece but I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.110" end="00:30:55.830" style="s2">love to have a platform that we were</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:58.380" style="s2">able to co-create together with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.830" end="00:31:00.150" style="s2">people and had those people giving $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.380" end="00:31:02.850" style="s2">month so that they were part of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.150" end="00:31:06.060" style="s2">what would that look like for you what</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.850" end="00:31:08.460" style="s2">would that one of the questions in</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.060" end="00:31:17.270" style="s2">you make a group this week that I asked</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.460" end="00:31:19.620" style="s2">was if what is coming is coming our</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.270" end="00:31:22.950" style="s2">we&#39;re staying inside for how we&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.620" end="00:31:24.510" style="s2">we need to stay inside for and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.950" end="00:31:25.860" style="s2">impact that has on the economy is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.510" end="00:31:27.720" style="s2">impact that has on the economy the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.860" end="00:31:29.160" style="s2">number of people who died or the number</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.720" end="00:31:32.040" style="s2">of people who died and we have to mourn</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.160" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">them and and and figure out where we go</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.040" end="00:31:38.520" style="s2">from there what world would make that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:41.550" style="s2">worth it what world would make what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.520" end="00:31:45.780" style="s2">coming and what we&#39;re currently going</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.550" end="00:31:47.910" style="s2">through enough of a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.780" end="00:31:49.530" style="s2">that you would actually sign up for this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.910" end="00:31:53.430" style="s2">you would actually sign up to spend this</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.530" end="00:31:54.900" style="s2">time at home and to sacrifice the number</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.430" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">of humans that are gonna be sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.900" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">and recreate something that works for</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.830" end="00:32:13.320" style="s2">what does that look like to you like</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.320" end="00:32:17.540" style="s2">you&#39;re ten I don&#39;t come on very often</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:21.300" style="s2">just Paris goes where I started though</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.540" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">it&#39;s where I started to feel someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.300" end="00:32:25.680" style="s2">okay being on camera by myself you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.580" end="00:32:28.140" style="s2">there&#39;s literally basically never anyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.680" end="00:32:30.630" style="s2">there but every so often so by yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.140" end="00:32:32.280" style="s2">with you know I don&#39;t know but I&#39;ll buy</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.630" end="00:32:33.960" style="s2">myself online there&#39;d be like one or two</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.280" end="00:32:36.180" style="s2">people which is like the worst first go</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.960" end="00:32:38.040" style="s2">because be like the only one there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.180" end="00:32:40.650" style="s2">like the spotlights on you as well right</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.040" end="00:32:42.180" style="s2">some people don&#39;t hang out but then once</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.650" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">you start getting them higher numbers</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.180" end="00:32:53.670" style="s2">and more people are watching we have see</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:56.580" style="s2">forty minutes go super fast almost eight</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.670" end="00:32:58.620" style="s2">minutes figuring out let&#39;s say have</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.580" end="00:33:00.540" style="s2">written here but no it&#39;s Thea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.620" end="00:33:02.700" style="s2">building this on the fly as we go</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.540" end="00:33:07.170" style="s2">figuring out what it looks like to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.700" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">part of these and so I will be on here</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.170" end="00:33:11.010" style="s2">talking to myself who needs me from six</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.020" style="s2">to six forty because that&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.010" end="00:33:14.700" style="s2">is figuring that piece out I will</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.020" end="00:33:15.930" style="s2">hopefully because anyone can call in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.700" end="00:33:18.180" style="s2">be on video so it could be people</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.930" end="00:33:20.010" style="s2">popping or they know like on periscope</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.180" end="00:33:23.100" style="s2">but on video so you could actually also</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.010" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">but it on Mountain voice like just not</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:29.730" style="s2">understand as well but if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.780" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">join like that and be part of asking</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.730" end="00:33:36.210" style="s2">questions and comments because this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.500" style="s2">what I won&#39;t do and if there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.210" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">participants we can we can participate</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.500" end="00:33:42.360" style="s2">in well that&#39;d be kind of cool it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">better need to be an hour but doing a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.360" end="00:33:49.350" style="s2">solution raise doing the solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:50.610" style="s2">raising on solution raising here but</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.350" end="00:33:52.470" style="s2">then that&#39;s already gonna be a high</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.610" end="00:33:54.360" style="s2">level of people wanting to participate</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.470" end="00:33:57.480" style="s2">in like it has to be from the pool of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.360" end="00:33:58.800" style="s2">people very participated I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.480" end="00:34:01.470" style="s2">you should have participated in one or</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.800" end="00:34:05.220" style="s2">watched a few of them in order to party</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.470" end="00:34:06.600" style="s2">probably yeah you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.220" end="00:34:10.679" style="s2">necessarily gonna know what is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.600" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">solution raising like I very much like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.679" end="00:34:14.760" style="s2">want everyone to be able to create one</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:18.510" style="s2">like you want to create actual potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.760" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">solutions within an hour and then yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.510" end="00:34:21.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not real in the world but all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">those things I went through at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.120" end="00:34:26.250" style="s2">beginning are amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.690" style="s2">they&#39;re possible like they&#39;re our world</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.250" end="00:34:29.010" style="s2">gets better with every single one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.690" end="00:34:30.840" style="s2">them like who wouldn&#39;t sign up for an</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.010" end="00:34:32.669" style="s2">education system where you get to learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.840" end="00:34:34.470" style="s2">in your learning style and it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.669" end="00:34:37.020" style="s2">find what is gonna make sense to your</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.470" end="00:34:38.909" style="s2">brain and you get to follow the path</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.020" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">that you want to to learn a new skill or</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.909" end="00:34:43.320" style="s2">to be able to coordinate with your</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:46.970" style="s2">neighbors and grow food and eat cheaper</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.810" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">fan of of like having 50 people do it</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:40.910" style="s2">how do we do this how do we work</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.340" end="00:36:43.470" style="s2">together in a team of 10 but having a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.910" end="00:36:46.080" style="s2">larger audience supporting it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.470" end="00:36:48.090" style="s2">participating in it when when possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.080" end="00:36:49.800" style="s2">right to say what they want together to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.090" end="00:36:52.850" style="s2">have things like zoom meetings on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.800" end="00:36:57.960" style="s2">weekends that are like on the weekends</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.850" end="00:36:59.190" style="s2">but having a zoom meetings on where</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.770" end="00:37:58.870" style="s2">of inwards now summary doing a summary</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.300" end="00:38:00.490" style="s2">of each different segment which is also</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.870" end="00:38:04.810" style="s2">part of keeping them somewhat shorter</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.490" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">and not staying on hours as he sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.810" end="00:38:14.290" style="s2">still on periscope but this could be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:15.940" style="s2">what occupy wasn&#39;t like actually coming</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.290" end="00:38:18.100" style="s2">together once a day and creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.940" end="00:38:20.130" style="s2">something by the end of this that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.100" end="00:38:23.410" style="s2">want to be part of it just depends on</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.130" end="00:38:25.930" style="s2">who comes on when who wants to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.410" end="00:38:28.570" style="s2">of that and who can we create it in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.930" end="00:38:30.130" style="s2">way that people want to watch it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.570" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">participate in it or not and then we</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.130" end="00:38:34.210" style="s2">figure out how we and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:35.410" style="s2">watching the five people creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.210" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">something but the five people are still</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.410" end="00:38:44.200" style="s2">creating something and still creating am</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.350" end="00:41:31.720" style="s2">have in place for this and how would</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.190" end="00:41:35.050" style="s2">what kind of resilient world wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.720" end="00:41:36.520" style="s2">have had this collapse and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.050" end="00:41:38.620" style="s2">help but not collapse because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.520" end="00:41:45.250" style="s2">need to it&#39;s only an economy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.620" end="00:41:48.630" style="s2">our food it&#39;s not our actual like he we</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.250" end="00:41:53.790" style="s2">can create something so much better from</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.630" end="00:41:55.990" style="s2">what was always kind of a hamster wheel</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.790" end="00:41:56.920" style="s2">just going going going going we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.990" end="00:41:59.080" style="s2">have time to even think about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.920" end="00:42:01.080" style="s2">going on just keep we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.080" end="00:42:04.060" style="s2">having to take a pause and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.080" end="00:42:06.580" style="s2">we&#39;re all on hamster wheels like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.060" end="00:42:09.250" style="s2">a tiny portion of our economy that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.580" end="00:42:12.300" style="s2">actually is needed is truly needed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.250" end="00:42:15.380" style="s2">keep people alive to keep the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.300" end="00:42:18.559" style="s2">some of it is is cool and the end</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.380" end="00:42:20.539" style="s2">like how what is needed what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.559" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">good for us and the planet and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.539" end="00:42:29.059" style="s2">create more of that so that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:30.950" style="s2">it and then yeah also where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.059" end="00:42:34.069" style="s2">weaknesses that we&#39;re getting hit from</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.950" end="00:42:36.349" style="s2">and like how do we make sure that at</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.069" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">least those particular you know gaps are</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.349" end="00:42:41.240" style="s2">plugged even had your the the current</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:42.950" style="s2">model but also just to build a list of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.240" end="00:42:45.980" style="s2">okay anything that we do in the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.950" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">has to keep this in mind because you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.980" end="00:42:50.180" style="s2">know it may not have been obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:52.069" style="s2">stockpile masks or to do something for</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.180" end="00:42:54.230" style="s2">certain groups or like okay so we got</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.069" end="00:43:00.259" style="s2">hurt from that that wasn&#39;t a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.230" end="00:43:02.839" style="s2">let&#39;s learn from that and yeah had</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.259" end="00:43:05.180" style="s2">anything like it it&#39;s not wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.839" end="00:43:07.970" style="s2">necessarily gonna be a respiratory drug</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.180" end="00:43:09.980" style="s2">like what our knowing that you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.970" end="00:43:13.460" style="s2">have a perfect solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.980" end="00:43:15.289" style="s2">what sort of is the ideal level of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.460" end="00:43:17.180" style="s2">preparation for costs really like okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.289" end="00:43:19.069" style="s2">so we need masks maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.180" end="00:43:20.869" style="s2">the perfect number for right now but</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.069" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">like enough that if it&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.869" end="00:43:26.990" style="s2">this area we have it covered and as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:28.759" style="s2">big enough scale that like okay and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:35.779" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about hospitals all over</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.759" end="00:43:37.069" style="s2">the world so but people yes yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.779" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">and then everyone&#39;s trying to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.069" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">competition it&#39;s like my people are more</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:43.160" style="s2">important instead of like no how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:46.220" style="s2">actually get enough yeah how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.160" end="00:43:47.299" style="s2">actually create enough masks that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.220" end="00:43:48.500" style="s2">you know what I mean send them to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.299" end="00:43:49.549" style="s2">hardest-hit right now so we know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.500" end="00:43:51.289" style="s2">more coming down the pipeline and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.549" end="00:43:54.170" style="s2">truth is we don&#39;t the truth is is right</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.289" end="00:43:55.940" style="s2">now we have no idea how to do that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.170" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">can commandeer factories we can make</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.940" end="00:44:01.759" style="s2">them produce and because people who want</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:03.859" style="s2">to produce but like even access to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.759" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">level of that you can do that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.859" end="00:44:07.250" style="s2">possible is scary</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:09.019" style="s2">that&#39;s going to piss a lot of people off</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.250" end="00:44:11.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s yeah you&#39;re right but if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.019" end="00:44:14.059" style="s2">were like hey we need masks who do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.750" end="00:44:16.700" style="s2">call a dear yes call the factory owners</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.059" end="00:44:17.809" style="s2">right can you make this no okay to go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.700" end="00:44:20.869" style="s2">the next factory there&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.809" end="00:44:24.440" style="s2">factory who will make it and especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.869" end="00:44:26.450" style="s2">at a time like this and then how do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.440" end="00:44:29.150" style="s2">make all the factories doing that how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.450" end="00:44:30.740" style="s2">you have enough that when people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.150" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">potentially sick and can&#39;t go to work</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.740" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to self isolate and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:41.020" style="s2">do you how do you do any of this and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:43.849" style="s2">this is a very weird event like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.020" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">weird we don&#39;t know how to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.849" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">this we don&#39;t know how to deal with in</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">this level and so what could have been</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:49.789" style="s2">in place to deal with that right to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.260" end="00:44:53.660" style="s2">understand the science to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.789" end="00:44:55.430" style="s2">history or like you don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.660" end="00:44:57.020" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna be helpful so to have one</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.430" end="00:44:58.940" style="s2">place that is like here&#39;s the DNA</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.020" end="00:45:01.279" style="s2">sequence here&#39;s how it folds up here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.940" end="00:45:03.140" style="s2">how it in filtration cell here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.279" end="00:45:04.670" style="s2">here&#39;s how other things infiltrating the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.140" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">cell we don&#39;t actually know how that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.670" end="00:45:07.910" style="s2">know here&#39;s all the different way things</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.319" end="00:45:10.309" style="s2">we know here&#39;s how the measles doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.910" end="00:45:13.910" style="s2">here&#39;s oh tuberculosis or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.309" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">happens to be right that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.910" end="00:45:17.510" style="s2">systems in place that help us with this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:19.279" style="s2">one and then the next one we&#39;re like hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.510" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve totally planned for a pandemic now</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.279" end="00:45:22.970" style="s2">do the best we can then the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.799" style="s2">hence we plan for that thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.970" end="00:45:26.990" style="s2">like every time we deal with something</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.799" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">we get better and better at it when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.990" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">not done for this like soul-crushing</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:33.260" style="s2">competition of like Canada&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.960" style="s2">the first one to come up with a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.260" end="00:45:40.279" style="s2">I don&#39;t care can you just pop the one</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.960" end="00:45:43.160" style="s2">faster like cult-like or can we just</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.279" end="00:45:45.170" style="s2">figure out how to get the ventilators we</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.160" end="00:45:48.890" style="s2">have to work for two three eight people</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.170" end="00:45:49.789" style="s2">right like how what is the limit how can</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.890" end="00:45:51.020" style="s2">we make them work that way because</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.789" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">people already working on that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.020" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">like ska to go through the FDA no it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:55.609" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it suck air doesn&#39;t get the air</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:58.069" style="s2">I don&#39;t know intervention laters do but</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.609" end="00:46:00.049" style="s2">like come on does it work right because</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.069" end="00:46:01.730" style="s2">if it&#39;s it&#39;s this thing snow works and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.049" end="00:46:03.859" style="s2">it&#39;s just the intern air in the air</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.730" end="00:46:05.750" style="s2">going in a know it&#39;s like well one in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.859" end="00:46:07.490" style="s2">million one in a thousand breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.750" end="00:46:10.490" style="s2">okay but those people would die anyway</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.490" end="00:46:12.680" style="s2">so we would instead of having a 50,000</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.490" end="00:46:14.869" style="s2">people die we have 5,000 people die</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.680" end="00:46:17.289" style="s2">right we&#39;re gonna have to take chances</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.869" end="00:46:19.779" style="s2">during this that&#39;s if they follow</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.289" end="00:46:22.309" style="s2">bureaucracy it&#39;s gonna cost lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.779" end="00:46:25.039" style="s2">because they can&#39;t think outside the box</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.309" end="00:46:26.390" style="s2">they can&#39;t innovate and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.039" end="00:46:28.250" style="s2">a way that we can help them with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.390" end="00:46:30.980" style="s2">way we can help them with that to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.250" end="00:46:33.020" style="s2">like like the they did they was a part</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.980" end="00:46:34.220" style="s2">to a respirator that wears out or you</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.020" end="00:46:35.210" style="s2">have to use for each person as there</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.220" end="00:46:36.740" style="s2">were three deep wrenching them and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.210" end="00:46:39.500" style="s2">person I remember what it was but they</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:40.900" style="s2">were like we&#39;re gonna sue that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.500" end="00:46:43.490" style="s2">luck with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.900" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">you&#39;re really gonna sue because we saved</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.490" end="00:46:47.000" style="s2">lives could you have produced I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">time period could be put in an order</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.000" end="00:46:55.640" style="s2">like what no no thank you</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:58.730" style="s2">take that BS back to that back okay so</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.640" end="00:47:01.430" style="s2">Slater then we will normally go so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.730" end="00:47:03.890" style="s2">wrap it up so I&#39;m going to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.430" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">live every every day from 6:00 to 6:00</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.890" end="00:47:07.250" style="s2">47 Standard Time whatever this time is</p>

<p begin="00:47:07.250" end="00:47:11.690" style="s2">that so about 15 minutes ago it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.220" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">go like why does that matter this one</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.690" end="00:47:14.869" style="s2">per se let&#39;s move on pre watching this</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:16.760" style="s2">free watching and that&#39;s not gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.869" end="00:47:20.930" style="s2">any sense who cares</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.760" end="00:47:24.410" style="s2">okay restart let&#39;s do a retake let&#39;s</p>
