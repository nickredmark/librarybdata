<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:18.830" style="s2">website that would be great but also I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:22.310" style="s2">feel like you&#39;d have to use a paid</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">me in it was I saying oh yeah for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.649" end="00:02:15.150" style="s2">landing page</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">I have almost finished the video series</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.150" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2">there&#39;s one or two more that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">do and then I have to actually put like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.180" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">the descriptions I have eight up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">the thumbnail which is big for me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">they&#39;re in their own playlist but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:31.560" style="s2">they&#39;re all private and now my</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">insecurities alone were my</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">indecisiveness kicks in now I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:38.909" style="s2">wait do I release them all one day apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">or do I release them all at once with</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.909" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">like the landing page so you can follow</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:45.859" style="s2">through and it&#39;s in the description and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:48.359" style="s2">I think both I want it to be unlisted</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.859" end="00:02:49.829" style="s2">but released every day and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.359" end="00:02:51.060" style="s2">you can do that you can go from private</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.829" end="00:02:52.859" style="s2">to public but I don&#39;t think you can go</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.060" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">from unlisted to public and have it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.859" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">scheduled yeah so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:03.060" style="s2">if I&#39;m a schedule you can do it but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:05.099" style="s2">could you could you could have them all</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.060" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">unlisted and have them linking to each</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.099" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">other so if someone wanted to find them</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">they could but then yeah so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:14.069" style="s2">use the new YouTube kind of official</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">kind of release party thing it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:28.739" style="s2">watch each individual video but if</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.209" end="00:03:29.879" style="s2">somebody starts with the first one and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.739" end="00:03:31.919" style="s2">they were like me and they want to go on</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.879" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">to the second one like for some people</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.919" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">will be more effective for them to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:36.329" style="s2">it as a chunk and for other people it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:38.699" style="s2">be way more effective to have it as one</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.329" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">and it is a playlist so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.699" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">releasing one on playlist every day</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I&#39;m gonna play with it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">see how it goes and create the landing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:51.989" style="s2">page or just really a Google Doc with</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">like the different linking to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.989" end="00:03:57.209" style="s2">I don&#39;t know well I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:59.129" style="s2">figure it out but it&#39;s some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.209" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">better than others for sure some of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.129" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">are more scripted some of them are less</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">scripted but it&#39;s about getting me the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:11.639" style="s2">gist of what together Tech is and why</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">mm-hmm and do you have a kind of a brief</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.639" end="00:04:19.409" style="s2">overview like is the first video pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">good for that no because like all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.409" end="00:04:23.039" style="s2">them are kind of an overview it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:24.900" style="s2">tech is powerful like is risky I might</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.039" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">want to do one that&#39;s an intro but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.900" end="00:04:28.500" style="s2">like even not like maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">I&#39;m done I&#39;ll do the one is an intro and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.500" end="00:04:33.509" style="s2">release that one first because it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">to kind of know about having that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.509" end="00:04:37.770" style="s2">think that all has to be helpful is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">first one on the on the website is to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.770" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">kind of an overview of some sort or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:44.759" style="s2">know on-ramp so people don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">they have to watch all eight videos to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.759" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">get kind of a concept yeah yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">basically shadow check as a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:54.930" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna run with transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">democracy and then you want to what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.930" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">is and why and then you go on to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">next ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.270" style="s2">yeah and then you can tease the you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:02.340" style="s2">could teach the videos or some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.270" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">other videos yeah and then I won&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.340" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">like I need to explain everything I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">just be like you know yeah like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">literally just say Tech is risky Tech is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:09.660" style="s2">powerful together it&#39;s more risky</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:11.970" style="s2">together it&#39;s less powerful after the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.660" end="00:05:15.690" style="s2">elevator pitch is the video like that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.970" end="00:05:18.599" style="s2">kind of and then the idea is also as</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.690" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">people have questions to release answers</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.599" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">to those questions along it to like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:24.990" style="s2">kind of becomes its own FAQ more for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:27.509" style="s2">big questions that I know I&#39;ve gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.990" end="00:05:30.930" style="s2">lot of I did with one of them like one</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.509" end="00:05:33.030" style="s2">of the videos is um this has never been</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.930" end="00:05:35.580" style="s2">done before because everyone&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.030" end="00:05:37.110" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve tried that no no you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.580" end="00:05:38.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve tried creating an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.110" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">Facebook you tried create an iamb to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.760" end="00:05:42.500" style="s2">for politicians you&#39;ve tried creating a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">food up you haven&#39;t tried any</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.500" end="00:05:46.440" style="s2">cooperative that we all own together</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:48.599" style="s2">that&#39;s completely transparent so that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.440" end="00:05:49.320" style="s2">can keep improving it so that there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.599" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">no failure</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.320" end="00:05:53.550" style="s2">cuz you feel that it you didn&#39;t try it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:55.620" style="s2">because you failed at it and we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.550" end="00:05:57.720" style="s2">learn from it right like we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.620" end="00:06:01.110" style="s2">access about information that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.720" end="00:06:04.289" style="s2">thing that people haven&#39;t tried and so</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.310" end="00:06:25.530" style="s2">enough ability to be in those phases to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:27.060" style="s2">contribute in the way that you want me</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.530" end="00:06:29.400" style="s2">to contribute I can&#39;t just say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.060" end="00:06:31.349" style="s2">not working that it&#39;s hard it&#39;s too hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:33.990" style="s2">for me doesn&#39;t is in enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.349" end="00:06:35.639" style="s2">contribution whereas it will be in ours</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.990" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">because that&#39;s a really important piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.639" end="00:06:40.260" style="s2">of a contribution of like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">working right like create the beta</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.260" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">create the thing that works enough and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:46.860" style="s2">then looking for ways to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">that will both be the tech people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.860" end="00:06:51.600" style="s2">know how to do it and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">have no idea how to do it I can see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.600" end="00:06:56.820" style="s2">broken piece can see the this is why</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:06:58.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy or just it&#39;s not easy why</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.820" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">why isn&#39;t it what would make it easier</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.860" end="00:07:02.310" style="s2">you got experience that even with</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">discord I&#39;m like I don&#39;t like it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.310" end="00:07:08.610" style="s2">too hard they&#39;re like it&#39;s easy I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not or it would be it&#39;s easy once</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.610" end="00:07:14.190" style="s2">you know like the actual discord isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:16.050" style="s2">bad it&#39;s that it&#39;s not integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.190" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">because they don&#39;t think they go off of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:21.060" style="s2">Facebook and other things for obvious</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.950" style="s2">reasons at the same time so game B has</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.060" end="00:07:25.380" style="s2">one and if I click on the link it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.950" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">creates a new discord account right as</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.380" end="00:07:29.790" style="s2">opposed to no I&#39;m now part of five</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:32.310" style="s2">different communities I want to add that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.790" end="00:07:33.900" style="s2">to my community and it like assumes</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.310" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">because I&#39;m not logged in that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.900" end="00:07:36.780" style="s2">not part of it and so that I have like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:38.460" style="s2">eight and then it like deletes your</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.780" end="00:07:42.150" style="s2">account after a while then you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.460" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">the old link it&#39;s just not the best it</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.150" end="00:07:46.860" style="s2">isn&#39;t my crowd democracy one and then I</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:47.940" style="s2">can link you know my cooperative one and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.860" end="00:07:49.290" style="s2">there&#39;s you know called Salaam and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.940" end="00:07:51.660" style="s2">there&#39;s game B and there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.290" end="00:07:52.920" style="s2">like if I could have them all those</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.660" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">sound like amazing communities to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.920" end="00:07:56.340" style="s2">part of on discord and I&#39;ll figure out</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:08:00.270" style="s2">how to use discord but if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.340" end="00:08:03.090" style="s2">integrated every new addition breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.270" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">and I should know how to fix that right</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.090" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">like my guess is it&#39;s easy for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:08.130" style="s2">who has more more background but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:09.570" style="s2">have to do that with Facebook every time</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.130" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">someone adds something to Facebook it</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.570" end="00:08:13.350" style="s2">knows it&#39;s part of my Facebook account</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:14.670" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t require me to relog in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.350" end="00:08:19.170" style="s2">you know name me the same with Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.670" end="00:08:21.990" style="s2">like it asks for permission to give them</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.170" end="00:08:23.640" style="s2">permission to use my Twitter information</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.990" end="00:08:25.290" style="s2">to use my Facebook information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.640" end="00:08:27.210" style="s2">what I want this court to do like oh we</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.210" end="00:08:31.260" style="s2">to add to this instead of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.840" style="s2">whole new one</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.260" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">but mm-hm this court doesn&#39;t care what I</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">slightly care but it&#39;s only only and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.460" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">it meets their other needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:53.460" style="s2">but yeah yeah they care about making it</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.089" end="00:09:11.520" style="s2">account more just to see what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.589" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">like to see whether and part of it is I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.520" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">mean I have this personal issue that if</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:22.020" style="s2">we get funding for anything it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:23.820" style="s2">come to me or it has to be my money like</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.020" end="00:09:25.830" style="s2">meaning it has to be my money I get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.820" end="00:09:29.160" style="s2">use for rent and food and such if it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.830" end="00:09:31.320" style="s2">comes to equal so we need like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.160" end="00:09:32.940" style="s2">corporation of business or more people</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.320" end="00:09:34.649" style="s2">to be posted you know what I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.940" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s an actual entity in and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.649" end="00:09:42.570" style="s2">of itself for that not to be the case I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.320" end="00:09:44.070" style="s2">mean that is just the way it works when</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.570" end="00:09:45.330" style="s2">you&#39;re on disability they&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.070" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">if you get money than that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.330" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">I mean you&#39;re not allowed to be having a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">not-for-profit or a business and doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:55.560" style="s2">business like things like taking the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">gross in the net and just subtracting</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.560" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually taking for your</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:01.080" style="s2">part piece event if we were paying</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">ourselves right like it&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.080" end="00:10:06.750" style="s2">rules so part of it and end</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:08.580" style="s2">incorporation protects us from things</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.750" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">like lawsuits if unless we pierce the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.580" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">corporate veil unless we do all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:14.700" style="s2">things so I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:17.130" style="s2">necessarily ready to incorporate but</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.700" end="00:10:21.140" style="s2">starting talking about structures of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.130" end="00:10:23.670" style="s2">incorporation incorporation itself is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.140" end="00:10:24.839" style="s2">slightly expensive I mean it&#39;s not tens</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.670" end="00:10:30.900" style="s2">of thousands of dollars it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.839" end="00:10:32.370" style="s2">thousand dollars but like even then what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.900" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">is it or not-for-profit is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.370" end="00:10:37.079" style="s2">cooperative if it&#39;s a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:39.450" style="s2">there&#39;s very specific rules that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.079" end="00:10:42.300" style="s2">followed including it has to be if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.450" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">here a BC cooperative and then it has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.300" end="00:10:45.240" style="s2">apply to be Canadian and then there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:48.690" style="s2">no such thing as a global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.240" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">but there are platform cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.690" end="00:10:56.700" style="s2">online and I don&#39;t quite know how they</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">work but there&#39;s a organisation here</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.700" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">called BC Cooperative Association or</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:02.339" style="s2">something along those lines that offers</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.420" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">a half an hour consultation for free and</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.339" end="00:11:06.120" style="s2">then has fairly cheap things going</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.900" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">forward for them helping you how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.120" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">how do how to incorporate under a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:12.030" style="s2">cooperative model and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:13.590" style="s2">they have someone who is more</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.030" end="00:11:16.530" style="s2">understanding of a platformer</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.590" end="00:11:18.210" style="s2">cooperative but looking into that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.530" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2">possibly setting that up and asking them</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.210" end="00:11:21.210" style="s2">if it can be on camera like it might</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.620" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">only be in them or I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.210" end="00:11:26.370" style="s2">would also want to be part of sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:27.690" style="s2">on that conversation because I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.370" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">possibly schedule it for this time</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.690" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">period and be a during this time and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:34.230" style="s2">they just join us on here if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:40.080" style="s2">comfortable with that and ask the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.230" end="00:11:42.450" style="s2">questions during that time yeah that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.080" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">something I might be available</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.450" end="00:11:47.580" style="s2">especially if we do it at this time and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">it might be good so yeah it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.580" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">that comfortable well comfortable they</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:52.590" style="s2">are with that the other option is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:56.490" style="s2">because I do want to do everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.590" end="00:11:58.080" style="s2">transparently but we can only be</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.490" end="00:11:59.550" style="s2">transparent right a few people were</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.080" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">associating with especially at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.550" end="00:12:03.540" style="s2">state agents parent and being</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:04.950" style="s2">transparent about that right like know</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.540" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re not comfortable being on</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.950" end="00:12:09.660" style="s2">camera and having it on YouTube so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:12.360" style="s2">not going to be but if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.660" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">comfortable just recording it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.360" end="00:12:19.350" style="s2">putting it up so that people yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:20.910" style="s2">not then you can do a you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.350" end="00:12:23.820" style="s2">it&#39;s best if I&#39;m not there and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.910" end="00:12:26.370" style="s2">can you know kind of say what happened</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.820" end="00:12:28.950" style="s2">and then that would be the official kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.370" end="00:12:30.900" style="s2">of transparency thing yeah that which</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:32.100" style="s2">puts my brain so it&#39;s a little that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.900" end="00:12:33.690" style="s2">one of the reasons I actually really</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.100" end="00:12:35.220" style="s2">like transparency in recording it is I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.690" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">can go back and be like oh yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.220" end="00:12:40.050" style="s2">what I said I would do that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:41.670" style="s2">harder for me to articulate it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.050" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">somebody else in the future what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.670" end="00:12:45.060" style="s2">happens but I can take notes and make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:46.920" style="s2">work because I won&#39;t definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.060" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">taking notes because that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.920" end="00:12:52.860" style="s2">thing I know cooperative so most of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.600" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">will stick in my brain but yes contact</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.860" end="00:12:58.890" style="s2">you know by the time yeah there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:01.620" style="s2">kind of cooperative financial structure</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.890" end="00:13:03.090" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of actually I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.620" end="00:13:04.940" style="s2">the name of it right now it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.090" end="00:13:07.390" style="s2">designed for open-source software</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.940" end="00:13:09.399" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.390" end="00:13:11.380" style="s2">and they have some requirements that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.399" end="00:13:13.149" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t meet right now but what&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.380" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">about it is that they keep all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.149" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">accounting online and then you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:20.890" style="s2">you kind of Sindh in reimbursements or</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:23.079" style="s2">bills or stuff like that and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.890" end="00:13:28.690" style="s2">public to see where all the money is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.079" end="00:13:30.459" style="s2">going is that open collective so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.690" end="00:13:32.290" style="s2">know if there&#39;s other options coming out</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.459" end="00:13:38.829" style="s2">kind of like that yeah open collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.290" end="00:13:41.800" style="s2">calm because yeah the question is if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.829" end="00:13:43.420" style="s2">have individual members either give me</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.800" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">an $10 a month or like wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.420" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">amazing here&#39;s a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.709" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">like how does it go from them to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.890" end="00:13:55.779" style="s2">entity without needing to pass through</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:56.769" style="s2">us right without it needing to be taxed</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.779" end="00:13:58.750" style="s2">and all that stuff cuz it can go</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.769" end="00:14:00.519" style="s2">straight to open collective through</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.750" end="00:14:01.660" style="s2">patreon that would be amazing even</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.519" end="00:14:02.620" style="s2">though of course patreon is gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.660" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">their cut that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.620" end="00:14:08.440" style="s2">transparency and then if we need to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.300" style="s2">know take part of it for running this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.440" end="00:14:12.130" style="s2">stuff like if we start paying for street</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.300" end="00:14:13.839" style="s2">art or start doing that stuff or start</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.130" end="00:14:16.120" style="s2">taking a salary if needed eight like</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.839" end="00:14:17.980" style="s2">those were not at that stage for sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.120" end="00:14:20.620" style="s2">for the salary part for ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.980" end="00:14:22.899" style="s2">for you don&#39;t I mean for mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.620" end="00:14:24.699" style="s2">that were transparency where money comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.899" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">from where it goes is the important part</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.699" end="00:14:28.269" style="s2">but also that we&#39;re not screwing</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:29.949" style="s2">ourselves over in the meantime right if</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.269" end="00:14:31.390" style="s2">we get ten thousand dollars and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.949" end="00:14:33.339" style="s2">theoretically we have to pay taxes on</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.390" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">that ten thousand dollars as at Lee and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.339" end="00:14:37.329" style="s2">or Jubilee and then we take that ten</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">thousand and spend it on idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.329" end="00:14:41.709" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of real world</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">implications for us right when we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.709" end="00:14:46.570" style="s2">amore braided and we&#39;re not right we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:49.209" style="s2">don&#39;t have that that entity that we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.570" end="00:14:50.620" style="s2">to make sure is not it&#39;s there it is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.209" end="00:14:52.390" style="s2">cooperative the ideas we are owned by</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.620" end="00:14:56.110" style="s2">our members even if the membership right</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.390" end="00:14:57.579" style="s2">now is too much that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.110" end="00:15:00.100" style="s2">members of the board the board&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.579" end="00:15:02.050" style="s2">members and we&#39;re open to more people</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.100" end="00:15:05.949" style="s2">being part of it even if we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.050" end="00:15:08.980" style="s2">the technology yet to vote I so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.949" end="00:15:12.459" style="s2">know um can you look into open</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.980" end="00:15:16.270" style="s2">collective and see how like what yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.459" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">turn over right now they yeah they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.270" end="00:15:20.770" style="s2">changed so I&#39;ll definitely have to read</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.230" style="s2">up on it it used to be it was you had to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.770" end="00:15:25.310" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.230" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">and a software project on github and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.310" end="00:15:31.899" style="s2">youth had to have a hundred stars on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:31.899" style="s2">so hundred people had to have liked it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:46.550" style="s2">is github blockchain no it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.959" end="00:15:49.370" style="s2">open-source software it&#39;s a to think of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:51.529" style="s2">the term it&#39;s it&#39;s just a code</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.370" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">repository so it does keep a history of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.529" end="00:15:55.639" style="s2">all the changes to software so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:15:57.410" style="s2">the question is does it make sense at</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.639" end="00:15:58.610" style="s2">all for us to be on there but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.410" end="00:16:00.019" style="s2">have code because we&#39;re you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.610" end="00:16:01.670" style="s2">mean like we&#39;re working around the code</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.019" end="00:16:04.610" style="s2">at the moment like it&#39;s you do</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.670" end="00:16:05.810" style="s2">well we&#39;re creating it right and looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.610" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">to do it as transparently and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.810" end="00:16:12.949" style="s2">open-source as possible but we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.839" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">very beginning stages but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.949" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">start having membership people who want</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.750" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">to start working like that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:18.980" style="s2">great place to find people to code it</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:21.589" style="s2">right we&#39;re willing to work on a passion</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.980" end="00:16:23.660" style="s2">project and it might be that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.589" end="00:16:30.440" style="s2">first have a beta before we can go on</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.660" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">there it has some code yeah so at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.440" end="00:16:35.930" style="s2">point we will have codes and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:39.560" style="s2">have assumed so far that where our code</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.930" end="00:16:41.570" style="s2">will be open source so I imagine we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.560" end="00:16:45.019" style="s2">have a github account that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.570" end="00:16:48.740" style="s2">the standard default just like high in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.019" end="00:16:49.160" style="s2">binary that&#39;s our code well yeah no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.740" end="00:16:51.380" style="s2">not that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.160" end="00:16:54.290" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty common on projects like this</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.380" end="00:16:58.820" style="s2">to have we have a readme file which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.290" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">also kind of a I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.820" end="00:17:04.280" style="s2">quite awake today it&#39;s it&#39;s Thanksgiving</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:08.410" style="s2">down here in the States so I slept</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.280" end="00:17:10.730" style="s2">really late I&#39;ve had pie for breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.410" end="00:17:13.189" style="s2">yeah usually there&#39;s a readme or a white</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.730" end="00:17:19.040" style="s2">paper and so that would just be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.189" end="00:17:20.660" style="s2">the stuff you&#39;ve written so far or link</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.040" end="00:17:23.030" style="s2">to the videos and stuff like that on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.660" end="00:17:25.970" style="s2">readme page actually is what we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.030" end="00:17:28.339" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s not uncommon I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.970" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">know that I&#39;m trying to see whether they</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.339" end="00:17:32.630" style="s2">really have a requirement anymore or if</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:34.190" style="s2">we can just apply to be they do talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.630" end="00:17:34.770" style="s2">about the need to have you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.190" end="00:17:37.830" style="s2">a fist</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.770" end="00:17:39.420" style="s2">goal or the fiscal host which is whose</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.830" end="00:17:42.060" style="s2">bank account it would go to and so we</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.420" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">still have kind of the same problem we</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.060" end="00:17:45.630" style="s2">still need to either incorporate so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:53.100" style="s2">the corporation can own the bank account</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.630" end="00:17:56.130" style="s2">or you know some sort of I did too I</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.100" end="00:17:57.930" style="s2">know here we have entity that&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.130" end="00:18:00.360" style="s2">those two there&#39;s a cooperative which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.930" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">a very specific structure but it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.360" end="00:18:05.940" style="s2">only be BC which means our board needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:08.790" style="s2">to be I think 50% BC people which we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.940" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">oh but when the third person joins that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.790" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">would mean they would have to do from C</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">which is very restrictive right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:19.500" style="s2">know if the same rule is applied have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">be on the board itself rather than you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.500" end="00:18:23.070" style="s2">know so there would probably be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:26.220" style="s2">like a fiscal board and those people</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.070" end="00:18:27.900" style="s2">that are responsible for the funds might</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.220" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">have to keep that split but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.900" end="00:18:32.790" style="s2">think it have to be like every member of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:35.370" style="s2">the co-operative no but on the board but</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.790" end="00:18:36.930" style="s2">that&#39;s still up on voting people in for</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">it I mean part of this is transparency</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.930" end="00:18:39.630" style="s2">like these are the legal structures we</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">have to work within so then therefore</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.630" end="00:18:43.500" style="s2">owed like here are the people who we</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">have like we have to vote in 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.500" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">of people from BC and then the other 50</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:50.130" style="s2">percent here if we&#39;re voting with liquid</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:51.480" style="s2">democracy and you get to transfer your</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.130" end="00:18:54.150" style="s2">vote between them it shouldn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.480" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">that as much as it would if that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.150" end="00:18:58.980" style="s2">right well as long as the people on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">board and even and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.980" end="00:19:03.450" style="s2">that&#39;s allowed to be in the bylaws and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">BC like here but but you could put in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.450" end="00:19:06.930" style="s2">the bylaws that the board votes the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:08.580" style="s2">as the community so there&#39;s a legal</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.930" end="00:19:10.290" style="s2">separation there&#39;s the board and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.580" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.290" end="00:19:15.810" style="s2">because the board is just kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:19.680" style="s2">figurehead for for the legalities which</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.810" end="00:19:22.680" style="s2">is really all we want but as long as</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.680" end="00:19:25.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a few responsible people on over</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.680" end="00:19:27.390" style="s2">50 of them are BC and of course if we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.230" end="00:19:28.980" style="s2">something the US for corporations we</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.390" end="00:19:32.280" style="s2">don&#39;t care where you live as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.980" end="00:19:37.050" style="s2">get your money which is also I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.280" end="00:19:39.540" style="s2">in Canada and our taxes are higher right</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.050" end="00:19:41.460" style="s2">I&#39;m guessing what state do you live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.540" end="00:19:44.790" style="s2">I assume Texas Hara I&#39;m down in Texas</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.460" end="00:19:47.390" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have state tax so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.790" end="00:19:47.390" style="s2">federal tax</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.690" end="00:19:56.159" style="s2">yeah so yeah figuring out the financial</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.119" end="00:20:00.179" style="s2">structure is something I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.159" end="00:20:02.129" style="s2">thought of yet mr. no but it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.179" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">something that eventually I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.129" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">before we get before I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:11.279" style="s2">your lifestyle is as far as maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:13.019" style="s2">can have the money and have it but then</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.279" end="00:20:14.879" style="s2">it&#39;s still like if you get taxed on it</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.019" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">it still is like your income and in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.879" end="00:20:19.619" style="s2">texts on it but if you have a lower tax</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:22.049" style="s2">rate then we just have to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.619" end="00:20:24.059" style="s2">right like yeah so your salary is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.049" end="00:20:26.519" style="s2">tax that would it would cost you right</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.059" end="00:20:28.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you say you&#39;ve got $10,000</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.519" end="00:20:31.409" style="s2">you pay 3,000 but then the issue is if</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.980" end="00:20:32.970" style="s2">you&#39;re getting if this you have your</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.409" end="00:20:34.679" style="s2">employment that you&#39;re getting and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.970" end="00:20:37.559" style="s2">think you are you self-employed so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.679" end="00:20:41.220" style="s2">don&#39;t know how much yeah I&#39;m fully</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.559" end="00:20:44.039" style="s2">employed right now so yeah it would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.220" end="00:20:45.059" style="s2">it would add some complexity yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.039" end="00:20:46.710" style="s2">I could definitely have it in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.059" end="00:20:49.860" style="s2">different account but yeah I&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.710" end="00:20:51.990" style="s2">talk to an accountant and a tax for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.860" end="00:20:54.179" style="s2">things like patreon sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.990" end="00:20:57.720" style="s2">different because it&#39;s after tax from</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.179" end="00:21:00.019" style="s2">them you don&#39;t get taxed on it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:02.399" style="s2">state by state province by province</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.019" end="00:21:04.679" style="s2">whether or not those things are I know</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.399" end="00:21:07.320" style="s2">for me it counts not in the tax not with</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.679" end="00:21:09.749" style="s2">CRA but with the disability people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.320" end="00:21:12.360" style="s2">sighs there&#39;s just ridiculous rules like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.749" end="00:21:14.549" style="s2">when I first looked into it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.360" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">know business I know finance enough and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.549" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">I had had my own businesses and written</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:21.690" style="s2">stuff off and I was like okay so hey if</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:23.490" style="s2">I have if I buy a car for $1,000 and fix</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.690" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">it up I can&#39;t but if I couldn&#39;t did it</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.490" end="00:21:27.419" style="s2">and I sold it for 2,000 like yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:29.249" style="s2">taking 2,000 off I&#39;m like but I bought</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.419" end="00:21:30.419" style="s2">it for a thousand put labour into it put</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.249" end="00:21:32.549" style="s2">stuff into it they&#39;re like no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.419" end="00:21:35.999" style="s2">taking off what you sell it for which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.549" end="00:21:37.769" style="s2">not like so people who have disabilities</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.999" end="00:21:38.850" style="s2">and who are poor aren&#39;t allowed services</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.769" end="00:21:43.379" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re telling me because</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.850" end="00:21:45.570" style="s2">you can&#39;t have a business that has no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.379" end="00:21:47.700" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t cost anything so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.570" end="00:21:50.669" style="s2">you&#39;re anyway so it&#39;s a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.700" end="00:21:54.119" style="s2">structure but it is the law until I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.669" end="00:21:55.470" style="s2">be able to get off of it that is in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.119" end="00:21:56.759" style="s2">you know you want to get paid with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.470" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">I want eventually a paid with this so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.759" end="00:22:00.180" style="s2">don&#39;t have to rely on stupid government</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:03.370" style="s2">rules too</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.180" end="00:22:06.040" style="s2">work with yeah there are some fiscal</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.370" end="00:22:08.560" style="s2">hosts that they have so I can have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.040" end="00:22:13.750" style="s2">look and see if we would could</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.560" end="00:22:16.420" style="s2">potentially be accepted so yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.750" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s an open-source collective so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.420" end="00:22:22.600" style="s2">if your software is open source which I</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:23.950" style="s2">think ours will be then if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.600" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">hundred github stars then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.950" end="00:22:27.880" style="s2">consider you we would still have to sell</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.180" style="s2">them and then there could be the fiscal</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.880" end="00:22:34.180" style="s2">host and then we would you know if I did</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.180" end="00:22:37.000" style="s2">some programming and wanted to build</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.180" end="00:22:38.680" style="s2">that I would just plug you know sinem</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.000" end="00:22:41.620" style="s2">the bill and it&#39;d all be tracked online</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.680" end="00:22:43.390" style="s2">and open some people can see exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.620" end="00:22:45.430" style="s2">where the money is going and stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.390" end="00:22:48.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand that so stars are a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.430" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">currency I know in in in github stars</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.760" end="00:22:55.930" style="s2">just alike it&#39;s like in facebook so make</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:57.490" style="s2">sure yeah for them to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.930" end="00:22:59.620" style="s2">project is something people are using</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.490" end="00:23:01.990" style="s2">then you have to have a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.620" end="00:23:04.570" style="s2">say oh I want to remember this project</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.990" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">and and use it but the problem is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.570" end="00:23:08.500" style="s2">not making a lot of times in github</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:10.930" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re open sourcing the code for</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.500" end="00:23:13.420" style="s2">other developers to use but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.930" end="00:23:17.500" style="s2">making this for developers we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.420" end="00:23:19.300" style="s2">this for end-users I mean yeah so any</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.500" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">developer that is using the code</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.300" end="00:23:22.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be using it most likely</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:25.090" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be using it on their own site</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.690" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">so they normally wouldn&#39;t star it so</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.090" end="00:23:32.770" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of in a quirk there but when</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:35.020" style="s2">we yeah yeah so it&#39;s kind of a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.770" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">and the egg thing everything&#39;s a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.020" end="00:23:38.170" style="s2">and the egg thing with this thing you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">need money to make it you need to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.170" end="00:23:43.510" style="s2">it funny where you could have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:45.880" style="s2">conversations you need to have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.510" end="00:23:48.970" style="s2">conversations you know what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.880" end="00:23:51.820" style="s2"> to create it and I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.970" end="00:23:54.310" style="s2">have a larger cause like you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.820" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">the things about the tech cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.310" end="00:23:58.810" style="s2">that you&#39;ve said is that it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:00.310" style="s2">you want to get the input from a group</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.810" end="00:24:02.620" style="s2">of people as opposed to just to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.310" end="00:24:04.300" style="s2">right and right now we&#39;re just at 2 so</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.620" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">we&#39;d still even probably before we</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.300" end="00:24:08.500" style="s2">collect money I&#39;d be ideal if we had 50</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2">or 100 people that are interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.500" end="00:24:12.540" style="s2">idea and giving feedback so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:15.930" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.540" end="00:24:18.630" style="s2">collaborate it&#39;s a this it&#39;s built from</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.930" end="00:24:21.780" style="s2">the opinions of those people the larger</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.630" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">the group the better so maybe you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.780" end="00:24:24.780" style="s2">was kind of thinking about getting the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">funds and stuff but maybe the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.780" end="00:24:30.060" style="s2">thing is doing exactly what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:31.710" style="s2">selling the idea or you know getting the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.060" end="00:24:34.040" style="s2">idea out there and just getting people</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.710" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">to sign up and be part of a community</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.040" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">for building this so this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:40.650" style="s2">question again in chicken-and-egg is are</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:45.020" style="s2">we getting people to sign up for idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.650" end="00:24:47.930" style="s2">cafe or for together tech so I my</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.020" end="00:24:53.430" style="s2">suggestion is that we do together tech</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.930" end="00:24:57.500" style="s2">because what I&#39;d like to have three or</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.430" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">four ideas and see which one takes off I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:25:03.450" style="s2">think idea cafe is something we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:05.280" style="s2">definitely need because but but it may</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.450" end="00:25:10.550" style="s2">end up being more administrative and not</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.280" end="00:25:14.010" style="s2">be something that people gravitate to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.550" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">and so we&#39;ll have to we&#39;ll have to build</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.010" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">it as part of the process but it may be</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:21.150" style="s2">it may not be what draws people it may</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:26.550" style="s2">be they may prefer like a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.150" end="00:25:28.020" style="s2">alternative or you know we&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.550" end="00:25:29.430" style="s2">kind of see what the traction is in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.020" end="00:25:31.590" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I wouldn&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.430" end="00:25:33.180" style="s2">them sign up for idea cafe and the email</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.590" end="00:25:35.330" style="s2">list I&#39;d rather be together tech of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.180" end="00:25:39.810" style="s2">which idea cafe is one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.330" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">yeah which is what the the video series</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.810" end="00:25:43.680" style="s2">is right it&#39;s about together tech and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:46.800" style="s2">one of them is about idea cafe like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.680" end="00:25:48.300" style="s2">is our first project and so yeah if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.800" end="00:25:49.740" style="s2">move on to a different project that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.300" end="00:25:51.870" style="s2">not gonna break it that&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.740" end="00:25:53.250" style="s2">be a problem I&#39;m also talking with our</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.870" end="00:25:54.750" style="s2">nest oh this week it was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.250" end="00:25:56.760" style="s2">like this past week but instead it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.750" end="00:25:59.490" style="s2">next week so we both have moved it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.760" end="00:26:00.990" style="s2">forward where he said you can kind of</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.990" end="00:26:04.140" style="s2">really talked about what that means</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.280" end="00:26:05.910" style="s2">like whether that&#39;s like a crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.140" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2">but it like one video right there would</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.910" end="00:26:10.710" style="s2">be like a crowdfunding video</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:12.750" style="s2">oh and or and then idea cafe or together</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.710" end="00:26:14.550" style="s2">TAC because I think together attack but</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.750" end="00:26:15.420" style="s2">idea it&#39;s it&#39;s all of its difficult</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.550" end="00:26:16.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s like we want people on</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.420" end="00:26:18.030" style="s2">board for together text so that if for</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.890" end="00:26:20.190" style="s2">some reason we don&#39;t move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.030" end="00:26:23.910" style="s2">idea cafe those funds are available to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.190" end="00:26:26.130" style="s2">create our other project but at this</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.910" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">same yeah I think I&#39;ve answered my own</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.130" end="00:26:28.160" style="s2">question</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.910" end="00:26:43.870" style="s2">then having people come on board and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:46.669" style="s2">using whatever method we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.870" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">conversations with zoom with the current</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.260" style="s2">things including someone&#39;s like hey we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.120" end="00:26:57.710" style="s2">should do this we should make this</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.260" end="00:27:03.080" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.710" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">yes what a great idea or whether he can</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.080" end="00:27:07.419" style="s2">help me make the series of video which</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:10.520" style="s2">is just me talking for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.419" end="00:27:13.640" style="s2">unscripted unedited on each kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.520" end="00:27:17.330" style="s2">topic into something that&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.640" end="00:27:19.250" style="s2">what Eric released he has a video series</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.330" end="00:27:21.320" style="s2">called none of the above when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.250" end="00:27:25.809" style="s2">putting voting for none of the above in</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.320" end="00:27:28.520" style="s2">politics and the like he just splices in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.809" end="00:27:32.150" style="s2">graphics right like it&#39;s fairly simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.520" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not top of the line YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.150" end="00:27:36.350" style="s2">but it&#39;s definitely better than what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:39.650" style="s2">have because I can&#39;t even edit let alone</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.350" end="00:27:42.020" style="s2">put in other things and so he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.650" end="00:27:45.410" style="s2">take the video series and work on them</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.020" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">one by one and then it starts out with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.410" end="00:27:48.770" style="s2">just me and then it slowly does that but</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.419" style="s2">I haven&#39;t talked to him so I&#39;m no idea</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.419" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">he&#39;s looking to do and or what his skill</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.299" end="00:27:58.910" style="s2">set is to be able to do those things but</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.880" end="00:30:54.860" style="s2">in it notes not done the intro piece and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.070" end="00:30:59.240" style="s2">the how to get involved these are two</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.860" end="00:31:01.910" style="s2">pretty good book at these and then even</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.240" end="00:31:05.300" style="s2">if I don&#39;t have the video descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:08.360" style="s2">yet it&#39;s about do I I think we already</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.300" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">yeah I make them all unlisted and if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.360" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">can figure out how to make them public</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:14.750" style="s2">one day at a time</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:16.460" style="s2">great if not like it&#39;s more about people</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:18.830" style="s2">coming on board and signing up but if</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.460" end="00:31:20.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what is your gut like is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.830" end="00:31:22.010" style="s2">better to do one day at a time is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.390" end="00:31:24.950" style="s2">going to get more people signed up or is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.010" end="00:31:26.930" style="s2">it better to do it as a chunk and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.950" end="00:31:29.510" style="s2">think it would it probably be it</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.930" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">probably benefit through one day at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.510" end="00:31:34.730" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:36.680" style="s2">I don&#39;t or one yeah one per day but if</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.730" end="00:31:38.420" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s too much trouble it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.680" end="00:31:42.140" style="s2">probably not worth spending too much</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.420" end="00:31:44.180" style="s2">time to figure it out like can I put a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.140" end="00:31:46.630" style="s2">link at the end of each video to you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.180" end="00:31:49.340" style="s2">sign up here yeah probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.630" end="00:31:50.510" style="s2">mm-hmm if we if we set up that MailChimp</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.340" end="00:31:52.250" style="s2">thing yeah it would just be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.510" end="00:31:53.540" style="s2">MailChimp short link and it would take</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.250" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">them to a forum where they could fill</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.540" end="00:31:58.760" style="s2">out on the MailChimp website and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:32:00.710" style="s2">later on when we hook it up to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.760" end="00:32:02.600" style="s2">WordPress site we could then switch the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.710" end="00:32:04.280" style="s2">links out that way people identify with</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.600" end="00:32:05.810" style="s2">the WordPress site and not the MailChimp</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.280" end="00:32:07.190" style="s2">site also it gives us the ability that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.810" end="00:32:10.970" style="s2">switch away from MailChimp had the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.190" end="00:32:12.980" style="s2">feature for what yeah okay I think I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.970" end="00:32:17.690" style="s2">think that&#39;s within my scope to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.980" end="00:32:20.150" style="s2">to do that and if you want MailChimp</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.690" end="00:32:21.380" style="s2">forum that is not necessarily within my</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.150" end="00:32:23.450" style="s2">scope it would take me a day to figure</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.380" end="00:32:26.090" style="s2">out how to do that so I love you I will</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.450" end="00:32:30.260" style="s2">send you the my username which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.090" end="00:32:32.900" style="s2">email and then the password and yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.260" end="00:32:35.810" style="s2">aniss no sorry the website person is</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.900" end="00:32:38.920" style="s2">also on there because I gave her the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.810" end="00:32:43.040" style="s2">to treat yeah we all need that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.920" end="00:32:44.840" style="s2">she&#39;s already yeah I don&#39;t want to mess</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.040" end="00:32:46.990" style="s2">up if she&#39;s already made a form that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.840" end="00:32:49.670" style="s2">just may take the external link for that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.990" end="00:32:51.590" style="s2">because when you&#39;re building when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.670" end="00:32:54.140" style="s2">build a form internally it also builds</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.590" end="00:32:55.430" style="s2">anyways so yeah but I can take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.140" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">it and figure it out but there could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.430" end="00:32:58.280" style="s2">more than one form right he called me</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:00.840" style="s2">one user or there could be more than one</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.280" end="00:33:03.390" style="s2">form yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.840" end="00:33:05.549" style="s2">like we just want their name their email</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.390" end="00:33:08.490" style="s2">do you want know where they&#39;re located</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.549" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">probably like countries I think it might</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.490" end="00:33:17.690" style="s2">be nice to have that as an optional</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:17.690" style="s2">field and then that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.730" end="00:33:22.830" style="s2">yeah the fewer things you ask them up</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.370" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">front the more people also happen so</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.830" end="00:33:28.520" style="s2">some places it&#39;s just email address but</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:29.640" style="s2">a thing would be helpful no good a name</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.520" end="00:33:33.270" style="s2">mhm</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.640" end="00:33:34.529" style="s2">for sure plus Senate like I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.270" end="00:33:36.029" style="s2">the people will be like Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.529" end="00:33:37.740" style="s2">they&#39;ll email me you know with my name</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.029" end="00:33:39.899" style="s2">they clearly aren&#39;t IPT for those out</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.740" end="00:33:44.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like part of the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.899" end="00:33:45.480" style="s2">process but it does make you more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.010" end="00:33:47.370" style="s2">gonna open it more likely when it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.480" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">your team ahead then when it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.370" end="00:33:56.789" style="s2">for obvious reasons so yes I will send</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:34:00.029" style="s2">you the MailChimp create the other two</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.789" end="00:34:02.549" style="s2">videos and then do the work - like</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.029" end="00:34:04.260" style="s2">upload it like to get it streamlines</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.549" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">that because I haven&#39;t linked the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.260" end="00:34:09.540" style="s2">videos to the other video so just list</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.240" end="00:34:12.179" style="s2">at the moment and once I get that link</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.540" end="00:34:14.099" style="s2">to the the account I don&#39;t say it on</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.179" end="00:34:16.169" style="s2">videos or I&#39;m not like sign up here but</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.099" end="00:34:17.780" style="s2">if it&#39;s just on there I can say it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.169" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">the last one like how to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.780" end="00:34:22.770" style="s2">sign up here and then also I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">in the description which is an ideal but</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.770" end="00:34:30.089" style="s2">it&#39;s better than nothing I can also</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:32.460" style="s2">possibly figure out how to do hun does</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.089" end="00:34:35.399" style="s2">too much of my scope like a 10-second</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.460" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">end piece of like sign up like I caught</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.399" end="00:34:38.070" style="s2">it in something though say like and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:41.879" style="s2">subscribe and it feels weird to then on</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.070" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">the ends be like but maybe like to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.879" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">something I can just tag on to the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:49.050" style="s2">of all the videos that is if you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">interested click this link and sign up</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.050" end="00:34:55.379" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s you yeah I I think if if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:58.589" style="s2">say if you&#39;re interested check out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.379" end="00:35:00.200" style="s2">the IQ : at the doobly-doo but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.589" end="00:35:03.330" style="s2">not the official name of at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.200" end="00:35:06.390" style="s2">description yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.330" end="00:35:08.099" style="s2">then I think if you say that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.390" end="00:35:10.440" style="s2">type of thing to wear if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.099" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">interested enough to go and find the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.440" end="00:35:14.620" style="s2">description section then that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.620" end="00:35:18.370" style="s2">and the truth is at the free mail chip</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.120" end="00:35:20.590" style="s2">Academy only we only have 2000 Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.370" end="00:35:21.670" style="s2">and that seems like an astronomical</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.590" end="00:35:24.220" style="s2">amount right now because I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.670" end="00:35:25.300" style="s2">have 2000 but I don&#39;t want 2000 you gave</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.220" end="00:35:26.950" style="s2">me your email just because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.300" end="00:35:28.360" style="s2">see what it&#39;s like I want to then take</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.950" end="00:35:31.720" style="s2">your email off if you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.360" end="00:35:33.430" style="s2">interested right no so if yeah the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.720" end="00:35:35.580" style="s2">if they have a little hoop to jump</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.430" end="00:35:38.350" style="s2">through I think that&#39;s probably good a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.580" end="00:35:39.790" style="s2">little bit of if they&#39;re like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">get involved with this that is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.790" end="00:35:48.250" style="s2">different energy about it alright so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:49.720" style="s2">main stream account that funding we</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.250" end="00:35:52.660" style="s2">talked about that the other part was</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.720" end="00:35:54.940" style="s2">what we talked about last time which I</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.660" end="00:35:58.990" style="s2">think does come into the MailChimp and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.940" end="00:36:01.270" style="s2">that is um introverts like getting those</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.990" end="00:36:02.830" style="s2">50 to 100 people especially if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.270" end="00:36:05.950" style="s2">introverted would be amazing because I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.830" end="00:36:08.680" style="s2">think this is like I said a site the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.950" end="00:36:10.690" style="s2">idea cafe in particular speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.680" end="00:36:12.820" style="s2">introverts it works for introverts and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.690" end="00:36:15.430" style="s2">if they don&#39;t know it does and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.820" end="00:36:17.260" style="s2">big problem with marketing like solving</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.430" end="00:36:20.140" style="s2">a problem people don&#39;t know they have is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.260" end="00:36:21.430" style="s2">not really solving a problem I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.140" end="00:36:22.900" style="s2">able unlike I don&#39;t know introverted</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.430" end="00:36:25.450" style="s2">questions like I know I am an introvert</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.900" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">and I know that I care more about having</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.450" end="00:36:29.170" style="s2">a conversation about something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:31.960" style="s2">matters and so picking something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.170" end="00:36:36.340" style="s2">matters and having conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.960" end="00:36:38.290" style="s2">that is the thing but YouTube live it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.340" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">just it makes sense that that&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.290" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">introverts like that is there poison and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:48.220" style="s2">not there yay I get to be on stage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2">not like I&#39;ve had to push through that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.220" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">and now I&#39;m kind of lucky I get to be on</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.900" end="00:36:55.120" style="s2">stage because I know what it can mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:57.190" style="s2">for the world but it still isn&#39;t a space</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.120" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">I want to be it like it still is in like</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.190" end="00:37:01.780" style="s2">yeah I get more like it&#39;s it&#39;s together</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:03.880" style="s2">tech gets more followers not I get more</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.780" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">followers right like it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.880" end="00:37:09.250" style="s2">energy that I wouldn&#39;t be able to if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:12.310" style="s2">was a participant and not a founding</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.250" end="00:37:14.200" style="s2">member it would be different but so how</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.310" end="00:37:16.780" style="s2">to get introverts to where I am how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:20.610" style="s2">get introverts to like this is bigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.780" end="00:37:20.610" style="s2">than that this is bigger than you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.700" end="00:37:25.090" style="s2">uncomfortable so let&#39;s own your own</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.500" end="00:37:26.860" style="s2">comfort and let&#39;s find ways to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.090" end="00:37:28.050" style="s2">within that like let&#39;s find ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.860" end="00:37:29.580" style="s2">this on zoom and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.050" end="00:37:32.870" style="s2">on YouTube right but like they need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.580" end="00:37:35.880" style="s2">be on board before that happens and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.870" end="00:37:37.320" style="s2">can&#39;t think of an idea cafe question for</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.880" end="00:37:39.600" style="s2">introverts but what I wanted to mention</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.320" end="00:37:41.490" style="s2">was I talked to I kind of mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.600" end="00:37:43.980" style="s2">general make a conversation on Wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.490" end="00:37:46.020" style="s2">and Heather had been chained she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.980" end="00:37:50.700" style="s2">participated in one of them before game</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.020" end="00:37:51.990" style="s2">B and where it was just the two of us we</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.700" end="00:37:53.490" style="s2">both shared and she was like well it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.990" end="00:37:55.320" style="s2">feels weird she&#39;s like it felt like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.490" end="00:37:58.590" style="s2">was on the spot to say that five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.320" end="00:38:00.510" style="s2">of stuff I was like I get that and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.590" end="00:38:02.190" style="s2">don&#39;t always make it clear that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.510" end="00:38:04.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have to write especially there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.190" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">more of us that you can always pass on</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.200" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">the five minutes and just be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:13.350" style="s2">conversation but that even like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:15.150" style="s2">information right like extroverts will</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.350" end="00:38:18.510" style="s2">tell you that introverts won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.150" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">until you ask them and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.510" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">like like it&#39;s perfect no actually this</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">is the piece it doesn&#39;t work and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.050" end="00:38:26.850" style="s2">finding in introverts because social</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:28.740" style="s2">media is designed for extroverts it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.850" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">designed to kind of be to put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.740" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">out there and have people judge you for</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:35.640" style="s2">it it&#39;s not became that and who was</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:37.490" style="s2">designed to be that but it&#39;s like fuels</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.640" end="00:38:41.610" style="s2">the extrovert piece and like them</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.490" end="00:38:46.290" style="s2">showing off piece that introverts don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.610" end="00:38:49.470" style="s2">have like and yet what we&#39;re creating I</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.290" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">think gives them something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.470" end="00:38:51.090" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:55.950" style="s2">but they&#39;re not going to see it as that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.090" end="00:38:59.100" style="s2">because of what exists currently yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.950" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">was I think it would be worthwhile maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.100" end="00:39:03.780" style="s2">adding a video to your collection just</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:08.490" style="s2">saying that we&#39;re specifically looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.780" end="00:39:10.770" style="s2">for introverts to give feedback because</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.490" end="00:39:12.870" style="s2">of the you know prostate a different way</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.770" end="00:39:18.570" style="s2">but because of the bias that that other</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.870" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">systems are built for extroverts so at</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.570" end="00:39:24.300" style="s2">least if they see it they would feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:27.240" style="s2">welcome I think the issue with that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.300" end="00:39:30.360" style="s2">just that there&#39;s one video one idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.240" end="00:39:31.860" style="s2">cafe and it doesn&#39;t include that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.360" end="00:39:33.750" style="s2">about together tech right and together</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.860" end="00:39:35.070" style="s2">tech isn&#39;t necessarily designed for</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.750" end="00:39:38.700" style="s2">introverts the design for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.070" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">so yes introverts come be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.700" end="00:39:41.519" style="s2">like check of folks everybody like in</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:43.199" style="s2">fact we</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.519" end="00:39:45.029" style="s2">the people who it&#39;s hard for currently</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.199" end="00:39:46.140" style="s2">and to tell us what&#39;s hard for you more</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.029" end="00:39:48.359" style="s2">so than we want the people that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.140" end="00:39:50.489" style="s2">everything works for if Jane is working</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.359" end="00:39:51.779" style="s2">for you you&#39;re maybe not ready to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.489" end="00:39:53.999" style="s2">game be and all about science</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.779" end="00:39:55.799" style="s2">specifically what we&#39;re focusing on it</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.999" end="00:39:57.630" style="s2">is like we&#39;re focusing on creating the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.799" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">technology that helps us collaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.630" end="00:40:01.380" style="s2">a massive scale so that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:05.989" style="s2">come and say what works for them and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.380" end="00:40:05.989" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t work for them and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.109" end="00:40:16.979" style="s2">getting introverts into idea cafe more</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.159" end="00:40:18.809" style="s2">than together tech yes although I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.979" end="00:40:20.789" style="s2">want them for all of it yes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.809" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">together Tech and it&#39;s specifically</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.789" end="00:40:27.799" style="s2">gonna give introverts more than it gives</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:30.419" style="s2">extroverts but idea cafe does yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.799" end="00:40:35.999" style="s2">although maybe it&#39;s maybe it is just</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.419" end="00:40:38.549" style="s2">like it over yeah if idea cafe though is</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.999" end="00:40:41.809" style="s2">the main discussion platform for</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.549" end="00:40:44.519" style="s2">together tech I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.809" end="00:40:48.959" style="s2">explicitly invite introverts and to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.519" end="00:40:50.999" style="s2">together tech yeah as well and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.959" end="00:40:54.779" style="s2">maybe for idea cafe just to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.999" end="00:40:57.749" style="s2">comfortable to introverts is to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.779" end="00:41:00.929" style="s2">some prepared language that explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.749" end="00:41:02.849" style="s2">says that you know optionally a five you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.929" end="00:41:06.329" style="s2">know discussing for you know giving up</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.849" end="00:41:08.489" style="s2">to five minutes of your you know so kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.329" end="00:41:10.529" style="s2">of put that into the phrasing and have</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.489" end="00:41:12.569" style="s2">it written down somewhere so so we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.529" end="00:41:14.309" style="s2">reference it at the beginning of each or</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.569" end="00:41:19.349" style="s2">make that intro video that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.309" end="00:41:21.299" style="s2">about for I think and because actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.349" end="00:41:23.669" style="s2">all an idea Cafe YouTube channel to link</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.299" end="00:41:28.559" style="s2">people to to say here&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.669" end="00:41:30.089" style="s2">you&#39;re free to not speak and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.559" end="00:41:32.309" style="s2">another video that&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.089" end="00:41:34.259" style="s2">specifically to introverts like this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.309" end="00:41:36.749" style="s2">something you&#39;re going to need to try</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.259" end="00:41:38.699" style="s2">first and help us make for you right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.749" end="00:41:40.109" style="s2">because like there&#39;s something here it</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.699" end="00:41:43.799" style="s2">isn&#39;t in the other social media</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.109" end="00:41:45.749" style="s2">platforms and as an introvert like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.799" end="00:41:47.249" style="s2">want this and I want you to help create</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.749" end="00:41:49.919" style="s2">this and I want to help you help me</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.249" end="00:41:51.539" style="s2">create this for like autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.919" end="00:41:53.130" style="s2">introverted people people who normal</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.539" end="00:41:54.430" style="s2">communication online social media</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.130" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for you</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.430" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">because of the unwritten rules and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:02.049" style="s2">know being forced to share and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:05.369" style="s2">like you&#39;re in the spotlight well beyond</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.049" end="00:42:05.369" style="s2">the spotlight because you too</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.500" end="00:42:12.970" style="s2">and that piece like that isn&#39;t today</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.049" end="00:42:16.089" style="s2">look like the intro that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.970" end="00:42:17.980" style="s2">recording them public right we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.089" end="00:42:20.410" style="s2">them private and then we&#39;re deciding if</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.980" end="00:42:22.690" style="s2">we want it to go public we&#39;re voting so</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.410" end="00:42:24.069" style="s2">everyone gets to say at the end whether</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.690" end="00:42:26.950" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s like the best of both</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.069" end="00:42:29.140" style="s2">worlds to a degree but and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.950" end="00:42:31.150" style="s2">is it is it really voting or is it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.140" end="00:42:33.609" style="s2">there another word that implies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.150" end="00:42:37.020" style="s2">because you need consent from everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.609" end="00:42:39.279" style="s2">right so any one person can say no I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.020" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">don&#39;t know the proper wording for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.279" end="00:42:43.720" style="s2">neither do I especially since to some</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.890" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">degree to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.720" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">I want you to be okay with that it could</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">go public right and if something happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.000" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">during it that it also is okay if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.510" style="s2">now aren&#39;t comfortable with it going</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.410" end="00:43:00.970" style="s2">public those are different thank you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.510" end="00:43:03.579" style="s2">right right but do you or maybe maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.970" end="00:43:05.470" style="s2">should because I we would still want the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.579" end="00:43:07.720" style="s2">conversations to happen even if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.470" end="00:43:10.869" style="s2">a subset of the group that would never</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.720" end="00:43:13.390" style="s2">want it to go public right I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.869" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">idea Cafe YouTube channel maybe not but</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.390" end="00:43:21.130" style="s2">the idea Cafe specifically yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:24.220" style="s2">guess that&#39;s so the YouTube channel is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.130" end="00:43:26.980" style="s2">little bit my platform for idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.220" end="00:43:28.599" style="s2">right like meaning if idea Cafe the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.980" end="00:43:30.339" style="s2">platform existed these are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.599" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">conversations I would want to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.339" end="00:43:33.160" style="s2">of and I don&#39;t care if they&#39;re live I</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.309" style="s2">don&#39;t care if they&#39;re recorded I just</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.160" end="00:43:37.690" style="s2">want to be a part of them but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.309" end="00:43:40.869" style="s2">hosting those conversations to be able</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.690" end="00:43:42.730" style="s2">to create the platform so I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.869" end="00:43:44.440" style="s2">to host a conversation on a topic I</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:46.510" style="s2">don&#39;t want to participate in but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.440" end="00:43:48.309" style="s2">going to learn anything in and have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.510" end="00:43:50.549" style="s2">aqua public right right right</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.309" end="00:43:53.559" style="s2">I&#39;m not even having those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.549" end="00:43:57.160" style="s2">because any conversation I host is one I</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.130" end="00:44:37.140" style="s2">in in public but at the same time if we</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.140" end="00:44:42.330" style="s2">stay public because they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.420" end="00:44:44.130" style="s2">be there um okay there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.330" end="00:44:45.780" style="s2">something there for me to learn and to</p>

<p begin="00:44:45.780" end="00:44:55.230" style="s2">or whatever whatever that is but yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.869" end="00:44:57.390" style="s2">yeah so and you said you hadn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.230" end="00:44:59.790" style="s2">with any ideas had I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.390" end="00:45:01.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve well we&#39;re talking I came with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.790" end="00:45:05.369" style="s2">few that I throw out and see if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.800" end="00:45:09.660" style="s2">a reason why they wouldn&#39;t work like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.369" end="00:45:13.230" style="s2">know just an opportunity to share and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.660" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">learn tips for introverts right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.230" end="00:45:16.619" style="s2">not that we would come unprepared for it</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:19.530" style="s2">but introverts giving other introverts</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.619" end="00:45:23.450" style="s2">tips because both you and I are on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.530" end="00:45:26.280" style="s2">introverted side but we&#39;ve learned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.450" end="00:45:31.310" style="s2">like we&#39;re both you know doing a public</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.280" end="00:45:33.900" style="s2">forum and scripted which is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.310" end="00:45:35.670" style="s2">so I think you and I would would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.900" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">stuff to contribute to other people and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.670" end="00:45:39.240" style="s2">I think every every introvert would have</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:40.890" style="s2">things to share and things learn from</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.240" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">each other so that I think that&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.890" end="00:45:45.570" style="s2">topic I&#39;d be interested in particularly</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:46.950" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe we need to stop making it</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.570" end="00:45:48.859" style="s2">focused on that it needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.950" end="00:45:55.590" style="s2">question but I want it to be crushed</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.859" end="00:46:00.990" style="s2">into question because it is right I</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.590" end="00:46:02.460" style="s2">couldn&#39;t yeah yeah I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.990" end="00:46:05.670" style="s2">phrase that his question is my mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.460" end="00:46:06.840" style="s2">before I said it but I can because like</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.670" end="00:46:09.300" style="s2">you could do like what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.840" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">introverted journey like you did for</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.300" end="00:46:12.869" style="s2">some of the other topics but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:16.619" style="s2">know that introverts would want to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.869" end="00:46:18.030" style="s2">on and talk about their day so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.619" end="00:46:19.770" style="s2">why I think something with an action</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.030" end="00:46:20.780" style="s2">would kind of pull more introverts and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.770" end="00:46:22.250" style="s2">some you know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.780" end="00:46:24.290" style="s2">obvious what the value proposition of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.250" end="00:46:29.870" style="s2">watching the video and then learning</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.290" end="00:46:32.090" style="s2">that it&#39;s a safe space it makes what</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.870" end="00:46:34.010" style="s2">makes a safe space for you as an</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.090" end="00:46:36.920" style="s2">introvert I don&#39;t know what they pick on</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.010" end="00:46:39.230" style="s2">and share that but like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.920" end="00:46:41.150" style="s2">question right that is yeah more focused</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.230" end="00:46:42.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s my autistic</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.150" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">side or my introverted side that likes</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.950" end="00:46:46.220" style="s2">having structure like that though it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.350" style="s2">likes I want to answer a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.220" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s structured even if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.350" end="00:46:50.930" style="s2">want to be in the spotlight I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.520" end="00:46:53.960" style="s2">be in the spotlight with a structured</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.930" end="00:46:56.750" style="s2">question been in the spotlight free</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.960" end="00:46:58.850" style="s2">range yeah and I think well I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.750" end="00:47:00.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a great one to start I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.850" end="00:47:05.990" style="s2">think we&#39;d try that one I really like</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.470" end="00:47:12.170" style="s2">that one and I think in general oh oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.990" end="00:47:14.300" style="s2">yeah no it was it was what how how can</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.170" end="00:47:17.450" style="s2">we make idea cafe a safe place for</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.300" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">introverts there&#39;s probably a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.450" end="00:47:23.330" style="s2">different ways to phrase that but that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.770" end="00:47:26.210" style="s2">was kind of one phrasing because I I</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.330" end="00:47:29.150" style="s2">think I do I do think one of my theories</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.210" end="00:47:32.210" style="s2">about introversion is that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.150" end="00:47:35.660" style="s2">why is that introverts I think tend to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.210" end="00:47:37.730" style="s2">be less they have to be more don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.660" end="00:47:39.980" style="s2">to be they are more conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.730" end="00:47:41.840" style="s2">everyone else&#39;s opinions it&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.980" end="00:47:43.640" style="s2">them and thus affion something live I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.840" end="00:47:44.180" style="s2">now have to take into account everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.640" end="00:47:47.720" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.180" end="00:47:50.360" style="s2">all 6nf million people yes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.720" end="00:47:55.490" style="s2">billion people it&#39;s a lot more and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.360" end="00:47:57.890" style="s2">Counting yeah and so we&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.490" end="00:48:01.400" style="s2">intuitive in the in the social sphere</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.890" end="00:48:07.580" style="s2">and so I think having a structure works</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.400" end="00:48:08.660" style="s2">for a lot of introverts because two</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.580" end="00:48:10.850" style="s2">things you don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.660" end="00:48:11.840" style="s2">what am I going to talk about and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.850" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about what is</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.840" end="00:48:15.740" style="s2">everyone else thinking as much because</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:17.060" style="s2">everyone has an agreed structure I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.740" end="00:48:19.790" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why I like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.060" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">structure is because it it makes the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.790" end="00:48:25.070" style="s2">social interactions less complex and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.830" end="00:48:27.050" style="s2">thus easier for me to intellectualize</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.070" end="00:48:29.030" style="s2">when you know people say oh you just</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.050" end="00:48:31.250" style="s2">need to like go with the feeling and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.030" end="00:48:33.560" style="s2">like no you don&#39;t want to talk to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.250" end="00:48:36.910" style="s2">what I&#39;m just going my feelings so</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.560" end="00:48:41.810" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s not very nice I have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.910" end="00:48:44.030" style="s2">moderate myself yeah and that is a piece</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.810" end="00:48:46.700" style="s2">of it for sure like what those things he</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.030" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">said the company that it lessens the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.700" end="00:48:50.030" style="s2">complexity of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:51.170" style="s2">that&#39;s huge and that is what like</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.030" end="00:48:52.610" style="s2">Heather and I were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.170" end="00:48:54.590" style="s2">Omega Rule it&#39;s like this is less</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.610" end="00:48:56.420" style="s2">information coming out of so we like it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.590" end="00:48:58.370" style="s2">versus the extroverts who are like wait</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.420" end="00:48:59.690" style="s2">where&#39;s the extra information we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.370" end="00:49:02.600" style="s2">know how to function without that extra</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.690" end="00:49:04.730" style="s2">information and that&#39;s bird like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.600" end="00:49:06.440" style="s2">this is designed for introverts and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.730" end="00:49:08.900" style="s2">how do we how do we get them here and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.440" end="00:49:10.340" style="s2">having that so I like your question I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.900" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">think that&#39;d be great one for introverts</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.340" end="00:49:16.460" style="s2">and then maybe maybe during that one we</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:17.900" style="s2">could say what are some other idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.460" end="00:49:20.750" style="s2">questions for introverts and have people</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.900" end="00:49:25.820" style="s2">brainstorm that or afterwards the issue</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.750" end="00:49:27.290" style="s2">is like and all of it um finding the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.820" end="00:49:28.340" style="s2">time that works like finding another</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.290" end="00:49:29.990" style="s2">introvert that wants to have that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.340" end="00:49:31.580" style="s2">conversation that isn&#39;t us because</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.990" end="00:49:33.080" style="s2">clearly we&#39;re not be like we can have</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.580" end="00:49:34.970" style="s2">that conversation during this time right</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.080" end="00:49:38.630" style="s2">but having that conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.970" end="00:49:42.680" style="s2">another introvert at least and also more</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.630" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">like I tweeted on Twitter I you know put</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.680" end="00:49:48.110" style="s2">it on Facebook but like people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:50.120" style="s2">jump at it to come be part of it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.110" end="00:49:51.710" style="s2">I&#39;m like I can&#39;t necessarily as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.120" end="00:49:53.510" style="s2">introvert do the market even the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.710" end="00:49:55.940" style="s2">way an extrovert can of like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.510" end="00:49:57.620" style="s2">thing&#39;s gold come onboard like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.940" end="00:50:00.500" style="s2">awesome but if you don&#39;t see the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.620" end="00:50:02.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to kind of you need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.500" end="00:50:05.720" style="s2">come try it you need to try it to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.240" end="00:50:07.850" style="s2">that it works for you and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.720" end="00:50:09.410" style="s2">all true like I want to have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.850" end="00:50:11.450" style="s2">why in Traverse need to do it before I</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.410" end="00:50:12.770" style="s2">have the introverts come on I want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.450" end="00:50:15.110" style="s2">hear what they have to say and make the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.770" end="00:50:16.940" style="s2">video for them and I have to pick one</p>
