<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">review</p>

<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">time for some questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">so last time we talked about that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">central figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">uh from the western tradition the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">touchstone figure so very much the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">the buddha was a touchstone figure for</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">right i wasn&#39;t trying to make anybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">into buddhists but nevertheless the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">buddha served as a touchstone figure</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">an exemplar that we could use in order</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">to paradigmatically guide our way on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">socrates is the paradigmatic exemplar of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">the western wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">and socrates famously said the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">and then i mentioned that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">following mcclellan</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">that we should uh be making use a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">of general practices right from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">that gives me also an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">remind you of the books so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">mandatory book</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">uh the wisdom of hypatia by mcclellan uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">please get that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">and read uh up to the end of the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">degree of wisdom which is parts one and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">and page seventy in the printed version</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">of the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">i strongly recommend for supplementary</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.440" style="s2">reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">that you get here herdos what is ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.440" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">and then as soon as you can but we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">be using it for a while uh arthur vs</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">lewis is the perennial philosophy which</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">very good introductory text on</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">and and its spiritual significance for</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">the western wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.599" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">so mcconnell mentions that there should</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.360" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">be a couple practices you should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">doing one is regular self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">and so i strongly advise you to take up</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">the practice of journaling that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">mentions</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">some of you have already been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">in anticipation of some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come with a stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve been uh journaling about your</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">i recommend that you expand on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">um so what i typically do is at the end</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">of every day</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">as the clinical recommends i i i look</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">for things</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">that i admitted to that that so i look</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">uh vices of omission the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">could have done</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">uh that would have been more in line</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">with the cultivation of wisdom and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">i failed to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">and then you also look for vices of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">commission</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">things that you did that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">perhaps uh not only failed to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">but might have actively enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">patterns of self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">self-destructive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">and again remember the standard we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">using here</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">the standard is not a punitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">perfectionism</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">it is a virtuous friendship and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">that brings me to the third thing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">you note</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">without engaging in self-aggrandizement</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">note any instances of virtue remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve already been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">there&#39;s an eastern version of this where</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">you celebrate the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">in this way you&#39;re celebrating right how</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">inculcating the various virtues that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">are finding are central to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">uh and the ancient tradition</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">uh that we&#39;re studying here recommends</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">of course four what are called the four</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">cultivar issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">moderation and i will teach you all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.080" style="s2">these as we as we go on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">and he&#39;s starting to teach you uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.080" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">courage</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">and and justice we&#39;ll talk about all</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">i will recommend as we get deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">neoplatonism that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">add in the virtues that were given to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">from the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">christian tradition uh versions of agape</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">uh versions of faith and a version of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2">hope</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">uh again all of these um will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.160" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">tailored though so that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">are comported well uh with both stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">and um you know platonism so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">please undertake those practices and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">then the other one he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">um that&#39;s fine um i&#39;ve always used</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">i mentioned this on monday i i think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">it as maximization</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">this is the collection of maxims a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">source from that is of course the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">itself wisdom of high patient he gives</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">but a good source for you guys is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">lectio divina</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">when things stand out to you and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">resonate you might want to note them</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">down and the point of these maxims</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">is to memorize them as guiding</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">and then we and then we engage in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">maximization and i&#39;m doing a play on</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">word here</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">because what i&#39;m what i mean is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">when i&#39;m trying to widen my frame</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">so that i&#39;m considering the long term uh</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">maxim i&#39;ve memorized the maximum and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">apply it in order to widen my frame</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">so that i have not just localized</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">attention on what&#39;s intense remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">hyperbolic discounting temporal</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">discounting and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">we tend to confuse what is intense with</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">and we want to invert that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">become aware of what&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">and teach ourselves and train ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">to intensify that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">this is a way of course of befriending</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">epicurus was uh you know you see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">each one of these traditions um and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">a fourth that i don&#39;t talk about here</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">but i&#39;ll talk about it after socrates</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">uh the skeptic tradition each one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">these traditions sort of they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">glum on to one uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">sort of an important feature of socrates</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">and then some uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">you know an important facet and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">some adjacent facets</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">um it&#39;s interesting to try and think</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">about trying to take all of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">different facets and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.319" style="s2">work backwards to triangulate backwards</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">to what socrates</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.319" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">might have been what epicurus was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">impressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">with socrates um was socrates capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">for anorexia</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">um and he thought this was also the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">basis for socrates&#39;s wisdom and courage</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:28.000" style="s2">and socrata and we&#39;ll see that each one</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">of these schools plays around with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.000" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">cardinal virtues</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">in a very very helpful manner</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">so anorexia is often translated as</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">tranquility um and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">good uh but i bet</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">you we need to take much sort of a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">of english terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">and put them together as i suggested</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">last time there&#39;s tranquility</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">uh which is sort of a lack of tumult and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">and these two two tubes are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">synonymous but i&#39;ll stipulate a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">difference here</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">there&#39;s serenity in the sense of a sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">right embeddedness in your world that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">had that is conducive to inner</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">tranquility</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">and then there&#39;s equanimity that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">not being</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">upset so adoraxia as i mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:24.399" style="s2">the a is a negation of inner tu tumult</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">inner turmoil inner conflict</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.399" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">and so epicurus was of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">like he proposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">that what we are most in need of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">is anorexia and so he proposed that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">what sets us most in turmoil is because</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">we are uneducated um about</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">our desires and our fears our desires</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.480" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">for certain pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s philosophically a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">bit inaccurate i think we desire</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">things that give us pleasure and we fear</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">things that give us pain</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">so all for simplicity cycle will just</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">allow</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">epicurus to speak the way he does okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">so we&#39;re desiring certain pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">states uh we&#39;re fearing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">certain uh painful states and we do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">in an uneducated manner</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">uh a similar proposal has been made</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">by harry frankfurt the person who</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">did the work on bullshit um and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">frankfurt</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">talks about the fact that we we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">wantons</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">uh that you know this is a an old word</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">a wanton behavior it&#39;s just impulsive um</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">and we all know this we know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">act impulsive uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">but let&#39;s let&#39;s bring out a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">important maxim that&#39;s also an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">as the child is to the adult the adult</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">is to the sage</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">you as an adult know you should not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">as impulsive as a child</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">that you shouldn&#39;t be wanted because if</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">you are you&#39;re in turmoil and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">self-contradiction and self-conflict</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.279" style="s2">but what epicurus is asking you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">is the possibility that there is a state</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">is comparatively much more mature less</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">impulsive and tranquil with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">your adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">that is analogous to how your adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">is more mature and less impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">to childhood and that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">promising proposal it&#39;s a very promising</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:28.959" style="s2">proposal indeed</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">so what does uh epicurus recommend</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.959" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">well he recommends that we net we need</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">to engage in a process</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">of education uh and we and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">frankfurt goes even farther i think what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">frankfurt does is helpful</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">he talks about uh process not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:48.399" style="s2">education but of identification</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">what which desires do we identify with</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.399" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">which pleasures do we identify with</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">where do we are where are we setting</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.279" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">interestingly enough that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">word believe originally meant it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">to utter a proposition it meant to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">believe in uh to set your heart upon</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">and this goes back to socrates notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">one of the things he did know is he knew</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">how what to care about and how to care</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:14.639" style="s2">very well</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">how to care in a rationally uh profound</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.639" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">but spiritual but spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">efficacious manner</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the main maxim</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">governing the education process</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">the identification process we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">use rational reflection rational</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">discernment and here&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">training in mindfulness is so beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">where the eastern and the western can</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">befriend and help each other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">trying to use</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">rational discernment rational reflection</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">to give prioritization to the ease of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">we want to try and get to pleasures that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">are the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">sustainable for us because those that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.760" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">are most sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">are the ones that are least likely to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">put us</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">into conflict they&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">sustainable so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">we can use them as a basis as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">grounding for</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">our most sustained identity the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">aspirational identity of who and what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">are most</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">aspiring to be so i think this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">idea so what is the basic program well</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">the basic program is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">when we get uh a desire</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">we step back and look at it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">there&#39;s the mindfulness moment right</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">and then of course there&#39;s also going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">be a looking through it but we step back</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">and look at it</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">and then we we catalog it we categorize</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">it and we use</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">a set of increasing uh we use a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">set of criteria and they they should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:45.880" style="s2">pursued in this order</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">in order to try and hone our</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.880" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">prioritization now this is not an</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">you are going to have to bring your</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">judgment to play and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s partially as i&#39;ll say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">why the savoring is so important</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll come back to this okay so first of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:00.959" style="s2">all you ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">first of all you ask is the pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.959" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">physical or mental</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">right and epicurus argues that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">mental pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">are are more important because</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">they extend into the past and the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">or to use frankfurt&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">terms uh they are are they have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">broader temporal scope with which we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">you see one of the things that makes us</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">adults as opposed to children</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">and so notice i&#39;m inverting something</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">that is normally talked about very</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">positively as it should be by the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">but now we&#39;re looking at the other side</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:36.880" style="s2">of it as we always should</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">as well which is yes children are in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.880" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">present moment but children are also</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.279" style="s2">wanton</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">and irresponsible at times which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.279" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">precisely why we engage</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">in the project of turning them into</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">adults</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">now that&#39;s because and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">interesting from psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">right they lack a temporally extended</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">part of why people develop narrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">this is from cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">his narrative allows us to develop an</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">autobiographical sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">a sense of self that extends into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">through the present and into the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">that gives us a larger scope of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">identification</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">and a larger scope of responsibility so</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">this is why adults</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">for example can feel guilty about things</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">they did five or six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">or they can aspire to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">four or five years from now like going</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">to university and aspiring to get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">liberal arts education for example or</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">okay so you get priority to the mental</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">pleasures remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">this is not exclusive or punitive this</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">prioritization if you&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">right there&#39;s just a physical pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">but very often</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">and this is another maxim we we suffered</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">not because</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">we do evil but because we prefer a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">lesser good to a greater good</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">so when there&#39;s a a clear choice</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:07.759" style="s2">choose the mental pleasure but for both</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">the physical</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.759" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">and the mental pleasure you then ask is</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">it natural</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">meaning is it necessary for your</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">physical life</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">your mental life or your social life</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">so your physical life i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">talk too much about epicurus was very</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">impressed by the science of his day we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">had a lot of good science</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">about that and that tells us what what</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">do we really need</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">right in order to sustain our physical</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">life not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">to make to give it vitality what do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">need for mental vitality</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">well it looks like we need uh two things</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">two things uh which is right um</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">what&#39;s called sort of subjective uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">well-being i think we get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">uh by doing this practice so what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">suggest we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">zero in on which is what epicurus zeroed</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">in on</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">is those things that are needed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">enhance meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">the sense of connectedness to oneself to</p>

<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">ourselves that has a value</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">independent of our own egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">and so that&#39;s meaning in life and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">those things that are needed for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">in life should be given priority does</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">that mean i exclude</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">any mental activity that not does not</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">directly give me meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">no it&#39;s not exclusive it is not punitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">it&#39;s about prioritization but what it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">does say is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">if i&#39;m doing something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">directly needed for meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">i ask myself what&#39;s the cost what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">how much turmoil is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.679" style="s2">you know how much turmoil is it creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">in me</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">and so and then and again i can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">you what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">i have to evaluate because it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:50.320" style="s2">be different for different people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.320" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">this isn&#39;t you know this isn&#39;t natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">but when i pursue it it doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">be causing over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem to be causing lots of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">turmoil okay so it&#39;s relatively safe</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">next we ask is it right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">so is it natural and that as i</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">just said like is it something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">needed directly</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">then when you&#39;re doing that as i just</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">said you ask is it necessary or</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:19.520" style="s2">unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">necessary means it&#39;s needed for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.520" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">in life or it&#39;s needed for physical</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">or it&#39;s needed for social health media</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">social life i should say</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">many of you are asking about that please</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">hold off on that because that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">come in when we talk about friendship</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">i know you&#39;re concerned about that but i</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">can&#39;t teach everything at once and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">going to address that when we come into</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">so is it natural right does it is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">directly within</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">uh you know constitutive of physical</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">mental life social life is it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">then is it short-term or long-term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">short-term you always prefer the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">long-term over the short term</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">how do you do that you do what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">frame widening you have to open up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">identify with your future self</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">in the future world because this is how</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">you test to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">if the pleasure that you&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">has sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">that&#39;s where the maximization comes in</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">that&#39;s where you bring in the maxims</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">you have them ready to hand you memorize</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">them you call them up and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">tell you this so i gave you an example</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">one from socrates himself that i use</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">the unexamined life is not worth living</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">am i undertaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">a pleasure that long term will increase</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">my capacity to examine my life or</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">decrease my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">to examine my life that gives me a guide</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">that gives me a guide</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">okay now once you&#39;ve done all that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">do those threes first before you do the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">fourth you must do the three</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">is it natural is it necessary</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:20:00.799" style="s2">is it long-term and then how easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:02.880" style="s2">is it to obtain how much and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.799" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">just a question of how complicated</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">of a problem-solving path you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">through to obtain it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">how easy is it to obtain the general</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">idea is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">ceteris paribus because remember the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">other three are important</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:19.520" style="s2">centers paribus you should go for those</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">that are easy to obtain</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.520" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">because they are much more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">and so then i gave you an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">practice that gets you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">into exactly that which is the practice</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:33.919" style="s2">of savory</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">where what we&#39;re trying to enjoy is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.919" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">purest pleasure of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">which i think is what anorexia is one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">my criticisms of how anorexia is</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">generally presented</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">in sort of academic world is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">presented as a privation it&#39;s prevented</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">as a lack of pain</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">and this i think misrepresents what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.679" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:56.559" style="s2">for epicurus i would argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.679" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">adoraxia has a positive content to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.559" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">which is the pure pleasure of being</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">and so i recommend it to you the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">practice of savoring the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">practice in which you turn the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">into a garden and you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">you&#39;re walking around and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">have no sentences or scenes in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">you try to have your mind completely in</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">and what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re opening</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">up perception you&#39;re allowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">more and more sensations and details and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">uh to flood in but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">almost like</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.839" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">worried about losing a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">arousal</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">in the long run so i understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">mean and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">uh that&#39;s why i i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to uh bring in</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">an aspect of flow uh in the savory</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:43.839" style="s2">uh because what you&#39;re trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">flow and i&#39;ll talk a bit more about this</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.839" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">on friday when i talk about the tulik</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">and the peritonic states</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">um you&#39;re in a state that in one sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">is fairly high</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">arousal uh metabolically</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">but nevertheless there&#39;s also that sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">of grace and ease in it it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">paradoxical i know</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">but that is one of the defining features</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">of the flow state and the savoring is of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">course a kind of flow state</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:09.839" style="s2">and so i think it actually um addresses</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">your concern</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.839" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">while still maintaining and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">we get our optimal performance</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">in the flow state so i think it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">addresses your concern</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">while still maintaining our allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">to the epicurean</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">maxim that we should be seeking adoraxia</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">we should be seeking that state</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">of ease which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">slowness right um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">it could be it means but that sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">of it it can mean it doesn&#39;t exclusively</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">mean this</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">but because it can mean contented</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">contentment because when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">that the the anorexia for the telic is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">contentment</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">but the anorexia for the peritolic is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:53.119" style="s2">something like flow and engagement</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">and so i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.119" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">that on friday</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna keep refining this for you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">guys and so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.599" style="s2">form of anorexia that&#39;s more more</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">peritolic more flowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.599" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">and and so the tranquility in there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">that is that sense of grace</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">uh even though you might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">metabolically in a very high state of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">arousal</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to come back to that i</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">promise on friday but that&#39;s to give you</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">a little bit of foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.800" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">uh kelly meyer says observation i have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">better problem with adding more and more</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">daily practice i already aspire to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">more than i have time for every day</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">the challenge is to become disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">us to do only those things</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to journal every day for</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">years so a practice that relies on that</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.680" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">habit</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">probably doomed for me uh okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">don&#39;t rely then so much on on the</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">uh right now um and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">and telling that this is but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">this is the pluralistic element of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">again this</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">it is not expected that you do all</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">everything i&#39;m teaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">and unless i i i&#39;m going to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">some work with mark</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">soon and try to schematize how you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">design your</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">a ecology way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">initially is you have to find what what</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">takes for you</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">try things on for a few weeks see if</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">they take</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">um and they and try it at different</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:22.640" style="s2">times in your life because</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">certain practices just don&#39;t take at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.640" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">certain part of your life i&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.119" style="s2">that i just tried</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">all the dream yoga stuff and it just</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t take for me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">when i&#39;m older it&#39;ll take i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:35.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">you have to do that and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.200" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">also not only do they take</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of a subjective side there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">an objective side too which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">how well do they actually address a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">how well do they help you overcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">self-deception how well do they and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">which kind of self-deception maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">egocentric self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">maybe biasing self-deception right</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">that sort of thing and so you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">so think about how things evolve things</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">about how think about how things evolve</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">this is how your relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:10.160" style="s2">machinery actually works</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">this is how children actually learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.160" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">something so</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">like when things evolve like</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">you get variation in the species and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">and then there&#39;s selective pressure that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">chooses the ones that are most</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">in in the the current situation when</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">children are learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">a new strategy or skill they don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">stick with what they first get the first</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">the first you know uh the first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:38.319" style="s2">sequence of operations that works for</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">them they create a variation</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.319" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">and then they put selective pressure on</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">it and then they choose it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m giving you hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">is the variation of all the practices</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">i&#39;m increasingly trying to also give you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">a sense a sense of how you select</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">for them and we&#39;ll talk more and more</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">about this and this is how you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">your ecology of practices i can&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">it to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:05.280" style="s2">i would be suspicious of anybody who did</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">but i can give you our universal</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.280" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">principles by which you can evolve</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">in the ecology but it is ultimately up</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">to you because</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">you right i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">this applies to me but i&#39;m directing it</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">too you are the author of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.319" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">nobody else can ultimately solve that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">this is why you have to ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">defend yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">so i can i can present you with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">variation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">sort of the set of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">universal principles of selection</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">but you have to evolve your ecology</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">and because it has to it has to</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">fit your patterns of self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:50.480" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">your patterns of aspiration only you</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.480" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">can relate to your future self and its</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">fire</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">i can&#39;t do that for you only you can do</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">that identification so</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m i&#39;m not trying to cop out</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try and give you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">everything i can but what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">get you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">is that you should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:13.440" style="s2">cycling you cycle through a period where</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">you&#39;re varying and introducing new</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.440" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">and then you compress them down you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">select you get those ones that fit you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">and fit together and fit you to the path</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">cycling and you evolve your ecology</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">okay everyone thank you so much for</p>
