<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">that one because you have to wait 24</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">hours after you create a YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">and request it and I created the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">channel a few days ago and I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">had requested it but today when I went</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">to go live uncle live but just add it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">the stream yard it wouldn&#39;t let me</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">because it hasn&#39;t been okay via and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">was still like you gotta wait 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t countdown so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">whether maybe I did it yesterday evening</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think so I think it should</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">be 24 hours so I hope the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:26.180" style="s2">on the actual channel and not on crowd</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:28.770" style="s2">democracy but hey if I&#39;m here tomorrow</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">friendly people anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">and I hope some of them I know some of</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">and there will be a little weird to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:50.909" style="s2">from code democracy where this one has</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">been growing so slowly I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.909" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">necessarily growing fast unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">from the idea cafe the idea cafe I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">somewhat of a marketing plan for to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">it grow beyond just commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:06.420" style="s2">people&#39;s video just basically how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:10.220" style="s2">very proud democracy it&#39;s like looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">for people who I enjoy watching and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.220" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">saying hey come on over be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">channel let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">conversation that creates better world</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">how about a global cooperative how about</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">cool we&#39;ll use their cooperative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:23.069" style="s2">then people you know in comments there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">a reason I want to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.069" end="00:02:29.640" style="s2">with people it&#39;s much more conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">what we are creating is saying something</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.640" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">and then having someone ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">being able to answer the question that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">is not what the idea Cafe is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">Cafe will be a space where people just</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">show up and have a conversation about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">meaningful question and so that is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:50.820" style="s2">we are doing tomorrow and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">come on here quickly and see what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.820" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">looks like see how it works when I am on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">YouTube I&#39;ve used stream yard on</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:02.820" style="s2">periscope and it&#39;s cool here there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">comments down the side I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.820" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">there&#39;ll be live comments like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">people who are on I don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">looks like for the participants that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:15.300" style="s2">part of this should be interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.300" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">comments because although on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:22.110" style="s2">live of course that is one of their</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">features that you have people commenting</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.110" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">and asking questions because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:28.410" style="s2">having a conversation that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">that conducive to being part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.410" end="00:03:32.940" style="s2">if we can have a conversation and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t watching it live on YouTube they</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:36.329" style="s2">are part like everyone else can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.820" style="s2">having a conversation if they want about</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.329" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">us asking questions suggesting questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.820" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">for next time comments on how awesome it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">is this exists and that we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">we get to create this in the world too</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:51.180" style="s2">they want to be a part of it offering</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">future questions but for us to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.180" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">likes to wait what is someone saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very distracting and so I like bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:03:59.239" style="s2">I might have to see the questions but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">they won&#39;t necessarily see the questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">and lettuce I put them up on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">because I see them down the side and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">then I can click on them and have them</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">actually come up on the screen and since</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">we have half an hour block which I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">I did not stay in the instruction so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.700" style="s2">will have that I have yet to send it out</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">myself to make the Facebook message chat</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.700" end="00:04:22.260" style="s2">with all the people who who said who</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:23.700" style="s2">expressed interest I really wish it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.260" end="00:04:26.550" style="s2">it was working because I also wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.700" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">send out the channel so that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:29.849" style="s2">could say</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">to their fans to their people yes here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.849" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">where I&#39;m gonna be having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">tomorrow if you want to come and watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">but maybe it&#39;s better for this week that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen because we were gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:41.940" style="s2">working out some kinks so which I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:44.069" style="s2">about doing it as openly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.940" end="00:04:45.539" style="s2">transparently as possible nothing needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.069" end="00:04:48.300" style="s2">to be perfect in order to put it out in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.539" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">the world we&#39;re going to we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.300" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">gonna perfect it we&#39;re gonna constantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">strive towards making it better and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">easier and more enjoyable for the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">who were being part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:01.469" style="s2">because that&#39;s what it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:03.659" style="s2">about it being enjoyable for the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.469" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">who are there what made it a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.659" end="00:05:09.870" style="s2">question what couldn&#39;t make it a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:12.090" style="s2">powerful question what was in the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.870" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">for you to be present lead on video and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.090" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">streaming a live to the world well sorry</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:19.560" style="s2">that&#39;s part of this plan but later there</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:23.039" style="s2">will be ways to have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.560" end="00:05:25.379" style="s2">without being live without being that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.039" end="00:05:28.139" style="s2">what we&#39;re showcasing what how powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.379" end="00:05:31.259" style="s2">a conversation is and how amazing any</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.139" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">human being is in order to create the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.259" end="00:05:37.940" style="s2">platform that hosts what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:37.940" style="s2">showcasing without it needing to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:44.729" style="s2">where anyone can watch it and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:47.699" style="s2">might watch it I am really excited I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.729" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">hoping I get enough sleep tonight we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.699" end="00:05:53.909" style="s2">see see all right I will see you</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.909" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like right around the corner this</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.310" end="00:06:01.319" style="s2">idea Cafe or who knows maybe the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">one I keep saying this is the thing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.319" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">is the thing if something goes wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:08.310" style="s2">it falls apart and then but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">iteration and this thing has had enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.310" end="00:06:11.490" style="s2">iterations where it was a Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:12.629" style="s2">and it was like oh people are showing up</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.490" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not part of the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.629" end="00:06:17.190" style="s2">this isn&#39;t about people showing up it&#39;s</p>
