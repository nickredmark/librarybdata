<p begin="00:17:21.770" end="00:17:24.380" style="s2">practice do you recommend a specific</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.030" end="00:17:29.810" style="s2">style Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.380" end="00:17:32.600" style="s2">what about yoga yes it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.810" end="00:17:36.470" style="s2">style it&#39;s called the Beijing style same</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.600" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">name as the capital of China Beijing</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.470" end="00:17:40.970" style="s2">style of you can find some online videos</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:42.890" style="s2">for the Beijing style especially you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.970" end="00:17:44.860" style="s2">find the short form long form takes a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.890" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">long time to learn that would be good</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.860" end="00:17:51.470" style="s2">feeling that there&#39;s the yang form is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:53.570" style="s2">really good and there&#39;s typically lots</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.470" end="00:17:55.540" style="s2">of videos on the game for them out there</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:57.830" style="s2">again so you can find a short form first</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.540" end="00:17:59.750" style="s2">rather than the long form the long forms</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.830" end="00:18:02.210" style="s2">like I donate moves it takes a long time</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.750" end="00:18:04.310" style="s2">but I don&#39;t mean if you have that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.210" end="00:18:06.410" style="s2">dedication of the time it&#39;s good but for</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.310" end="00:18:08.120" style="s2">the purposes of supplementing this</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.410" end="00:18:10.940" style="s2">practice I recommend trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.120" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">yang form I would avoid some of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.940" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">pounding and jumping forms like the chat</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:19.580" style="s2">forum so go for Beijing go for a yang if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:21.800" style="s2">you can find those other two excellent</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">if you want to take up a yoga practice I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.800" end="00:18:25.490" style="s2">remember I commend one that has some</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.770" style="s2">flow elements to it like if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.490" end="00:18:30.530" style="s2">sign salutations or things like that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.770" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">think those are excellent ways to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.530" end="00:18:38.410" style="s2">integrate moving mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:43.670" style="s2">with your sitted mindfulness practice</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.580" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">sort of an introspectively</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.759" end="00:19:21.580" style="s2">simple thing or direct thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:23.989" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not something you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.580" end="00:19:26.059" style="s2">simply and directly introspectively do</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.989" end="00:19:29.779" style="s2">and so that you can get yourself caught</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.059" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">into like a double bind so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.779" end="00:19:33.320" style="s2">might come in does the following try to</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.919" end="00:19:46.730" style="s2">that way you pick up on when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.320" end="00:19:48.950" style="s2">the flow state and try to remember what</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.730" end="00:19:51.259" style="s2">that&#39;s like or when you&#39;ve noticed that</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.259" end="00:19:55.009" style="s2">kind of attention maybe you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.879" end="00:19:59.119" style="s2">reading some texts that find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.009" end="00:20:02.509" style="s2">absorbed into write and so you try and</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.509" end="00:20:07.730" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to do is see write try</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.690" end="00:20:10.039" style="s2">to remember it see if it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.730" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">finding in your practice is similar to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.039" end="00:20:15.320" style="s2">those external moments of flow and</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:17.659" style="s2">photos if you don&#39;t stop there you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.320" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not there you saw also look for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.659" end="00:20:21.590" style="s2">reverse when you start into sense that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:23.899" style="s2">oh I&#39;m getting the flow and the focus</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.590" end="00:20:26.299" style="s2">here does that translate out into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.899" end="00:20:30.379" style="s2">world so that you start to find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.299" end="00:20:33.109" style="s2">in flow and in proper focus in the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.379" end="00:20:35.480" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for this self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.109" end="00:20:38.210" style="s2">loop and getting a dynamic equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.480" end="00:20:40.519" style="s2">between them and then third and most</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.210" end="00:20:42.619" style="s2">importantly when people other than you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.519" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">can start this is more long-term but</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.619" end="00:20:46.519" style="s2">also ultimately more important when</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:49.489" style="s2">people other than you start to notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.519" end="00:20:51.499" style="s2">differences in your performances and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.489" end="00:20:55.519" style="s2">your balance pressure more graceful you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.499" end="00:21:00.619" style="s2">get more focused etc so with that loop</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.519" end="00:21:07.159" style="s2">is actually our best way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.619" end="00:21:07.669" style="s2">sense that were moving forward see</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.059" end="00:21:14.990" style="s2">should be okay with but keep trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.369" end="00:21:19.909" style="s2">increase the duration correct</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.990" end="00:21:21.640" style="s2">yes yes so but the that&#39;s right but be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.909" end="00:21:24.770" style="s2">careful don&#39;t think that just because</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.640" end="00:21:25.850" style="s2">like you are mind wandering that your</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:27.620" style="s2">meditation has ended</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.850" end="00:21:30.020" style="s2">remember meditation is not when your</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.110" end="00:31:11.690" style="s2">why you separate flow and focus in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.660" end="00:31:14.030" style="s2">practice I separated although they</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.690" end="00:31:17.990" style="s2">overlap especially the way I teach you I</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.030" end="00:31:22.040" style="s2">select separate flow and slopes or flow</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.990" end="00:31:25.070" style="s2">and focus because if I just go in to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.040" end="00:31:27.170" style="s2">one or other the other I think people</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.070" end="00:31:31.580" style="s2">lose the stereoscopic when you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.170" end="00:31:33.950" style="s2">people just flow they tend to not do as</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.580" end="00:31:35.510" style="s2">much explicit training of attention and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.950" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">when you teach people just attention</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.510" end="00:31:41.990" style="s2">they tend to get into just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:46.670" style="s2">introspective space and they lose the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.990" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">effective introspective space so they</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.670" end="00:31:51.890" style="s2">both interpenetrate as you&#39;re as you&#39;re</p>
