<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">podcast live stream number 47</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">q and a section all right here we go</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">cats over our shoulders we are ready to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">answer some questions that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">uh so we&#39;ll start with a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">questions from episode 46 that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">before moving on to a question that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">comes out of the discord</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">server this week and then moving on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">last hour&#39;s questions before moving on</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">to this hour&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">first up will atheists and secularists</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">at large be able to effectively apply</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">the memetic level of group cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">experienced in religious groups with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">tools needed to bring this about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">necessarily need to be religious in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good one uh problem is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">some of the tools have been housed over</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">in religious space</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">can the atheists the modern atheists</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">pull off the the feats necessary</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">not on the other hand you can&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">well have a system</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">that is predicated on people believing</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">in rewards and punishments in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">that uh those who discount them will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">freer to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">various behaviors that are anti-social</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">do this in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">a secular and atheist context</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">and i would say in some sense the tool</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">for doing this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">pretty obvious what we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">structure the incentives of the system</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">so that pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">behavior is actually rewarded in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">long term and then we will see it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">elaborated by</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">selection if we do anything short of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">that then the disbelievers will have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">advantage over the believers</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">and things will come apart</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">good uh this next one did you do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">have anything to say on this or should</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">skip it um yeah a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">um excuse me uh what are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">on the world economic forums the great</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">reset</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">discussions this is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">both only know a very small amount about</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">yeah i i have not delved deeply i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">looked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">and so the basic idea is that covid</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">reveals</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">fragility in the system and we all ought</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.120" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">um what it is that needs to exist in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">order to make the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">more robust and anti-fragile and i agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how much i trust the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.720" style="s2">economic forum</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">to have this discussion um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">encouraged that they&#39;re interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">but i would say the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">in some sense the right one but uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">when the so-called stakeholders are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">ones that the world economic forum holds</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">dear</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about how useful the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">solution they&#39;re going to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">is because there is a real problem and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">is this in essence the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">realizing far too late that it has left</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">us in a vulnerable position</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">and negotiating with us in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">retain its position some level</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">yeah i think so um but at another level</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">yeah and just this question began with i</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t read it because</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">i seem to butcher the pronunciation</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">every time is it shana tovah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">we are now this question came in last</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">week or now between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">um highest holidays in judaism i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">that yom kippur</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">starts uh either tonight or tomorrow i</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">um and and rosh hashanah the new year</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">was last week protests have largely been</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">fueled by us versus them thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">would your podcast ever consider adding</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">nuance to this by interviewing a police</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">officer</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">yeah absolutely i would interview a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">police officer i would</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">interview a protester and in fact i have</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">had preliminary contacts with both</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">so anyway maybe i should uh restart</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">those discussions and see if i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">make it happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">yeah especially given that uh here in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">portland uh the fires and the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">appeared to have put um a mere</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">very temporary and not even a complete</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">halt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">uh what was going on in the streets here</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:48.080" style="s2">but they resumed with full force</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">as soon as the rains came a week a week</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.080" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">ago yep uh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">cat right behind your chair so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">should i be frightened i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">what do you know about hampshire college</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">in massachusetts and how does it compare</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">to evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">uh yeah so hampshire was one of um</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">five i think colleges in a consortium</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">along with evergreen along with new</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:14.000" style="s2">college in florida</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">pitzer college in socal</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.000" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">i&#39;m trying was maybe colorado college</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">maybe it was the other one i can&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">feel like i&#39;m not sure that it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">colorado college that was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">that was the um additional member there</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">but they&#39;re all experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">pedagogically experimental</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">liberal arts colleges everyone that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">um except for evergreen is private</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">actually new college</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">might be affiliated with the university</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">of florida system i&#39;m actually not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">about that but hampshire is private</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">um and so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">i think its model is fascinating it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">on the verge of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">as many liberal arts colleges are</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">while it has a really remarkable model</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">of empowering students in which students</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">are potentially empowered to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">uh terrific independent and creative</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">work what that means and this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">the problem we saw at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">is that it also allows people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">lazy</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">and have no interest in doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">interesting work of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">uh can kind of skate by without even</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">having to meet any basic requirements</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">um so you&#39;re talking about students yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">i&#39;m it&#39;s true faculty too i&#39;m sure well</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know any faculty at</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">hampshire but</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">i saw that at evergreen we saw that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">there were faculty were highly dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">and there were other faculty who</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">got hired and were impossible to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">of yeah did nothing no but um</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">we saw we saw we saw that less directly</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">with regard to the students at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">because our students tended to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">motivated</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">because um because</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">there was very high demand for our</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">programs and uh if you didn&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">anything you could easily find that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">other programs and not</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">not in ours i&#39;m just i&#39;m i&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">that really at any school</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">now you can find a way to get by with</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">doing almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to be easier at one that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">have specifically thrown</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">many of the traditional requirements out</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">the window</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">and i think hampshire has done some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">that as evergreen certainly did</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">and there are virtues to that there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">advantages but it does mean that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to game the system if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">interested in gaming the system if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">if you want to throw away your tuition</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">money and come away with a degree</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">but no education you can do that easily</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">at a school that has no breath</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">requirements</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">you can do it at another school too but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">you can do it anyway but</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">you know hampshire had supreme promise i</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">do think it may not be around</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">in five years yes my recollection is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">has been on the financial rocks for many</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">yeah um i would also say that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">things that is true and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">you know we uh both graduated from santa</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">cruz which was experimental one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">things that&#39;s true for</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">but also a an r1 like santa cruz is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">a research one university with</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:01.680" style="s2">uh you know federal funding for big</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">research so it is both an experimental</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">liberal arts thing inside a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">massive research university right um so</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">the analogy that it has with evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.279" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">is that it was public</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">yes so let&#39;s just say all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">things are failing in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">maybe colorado college</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.839" style="s2">isn&#39;t it might be the one example that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">isn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.839" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">i suspect pitzer isn&#39;t either um just</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s part of the consortium down</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">there in the claremont colleges and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">look out for each other financially but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">um you know being</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:37.519" style="s2">in a consortium with claremont mckenna</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">and harvey mudd and such it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of you know wacky liberal</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">arts</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">um one but it it&#39;s it&#39;s all it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">cluster</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">in the same way that there are like</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">clusters of</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">strangeness at santa cruz but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">also a lot of amazingness</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a cluster but it may not be as</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">clusterfucked because at one level</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">you can go to pitzer if it sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">to you and take classes elsewhere if it</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:00.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t turn out</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:02.639" style="s2">right so and that&#39;s the same as just</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.800" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">hampshire actually hampshire is part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.639" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">that consortium a different consortium</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">of five colleges that includes</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">umass amherst and amherst and smith and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">mount holyoke</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">i think it&#39;s gonna be the five there so</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a kind of uh protection</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">you know an experimental model yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">allows students to participate</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">very much so at different degrees is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">um the thing that was missing from all</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">of the others</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">that evergreen had that i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">absolute magic</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">was the full-time programs right right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">the when you as faculty are full-time in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">one class and your students are</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">full-time in one class and that class</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">can go on for a full year</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">it means that the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">professor and student and between</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">students and each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">is totally different than a regular</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">college and what it means is you can do</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">a kind of teaching that can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">in a regular college and you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">sure there were more faculty at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">point that we were at evergreen there</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">were more faculty doing nothing with</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">that opportunity than doing something</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">but if you wanted to do something it</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">allowed you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">in my opinion to teach in a way that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">effectively custom</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:16.959" style="s2">tuned to each student which you and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">both did</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.959" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">well we knew our students well we cared</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">about them and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">it meant that you could think about what</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">each person in the room was hearing</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">you know who has trouble with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">of concept and what needs to be said so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">that they get it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">um you could you know not be so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">regimented to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">what you plan to talk about that day a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:38.959" style="s2">concept that turns out to take longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">than you think it&#39;s going to can</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.959" end="00:15:46.079" style="s2">can expand to take up more more space</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">all of those things were uh like magic</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.079" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">for professors that wanted to push the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">envelope of what was possible and for</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">students that were not a good fit for</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">normal school</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">because they could get um a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">education that just wasn&#39;t available</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">to the extent that they were an</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.839" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">anonymous person in the room so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">now um just one little nuance here is</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">colorado college</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">like a number of smaller less well-known</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">colleges mostly scattered throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">midwest i believe do have something</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">called a block system</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">right where they do full-time full-time</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they call them programs</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">but for three</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.199" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">three weeks at a time so at evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">you had 10 20 30 week</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">programs and colorado college for</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">instance i think has eight of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">three week blocks a year</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">and at any given moment you&#39;re only in</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">one thing with that class and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">faculty for three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">but they 100 always guaranteed end at</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">the end of the three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">and you don&#39;t continue um with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">professor in that learning community</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">into the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">to the next block so um it i imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">hints</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">at some of this um power but it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">get all the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">no um i will say at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">evergreen was looking rickety to us we</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">just happened to give a talk out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">colorado college and it was the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">model that was different enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">from normal that i felt like maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">that&#39;s actually something i could do</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">right it was very hard to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">walking away from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">beautiful freedom that we had at</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">evergreen and the amazing community that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">it allowed us to build</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:17.199" style="s2">but it would be interesting to figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">out what you would do with a block</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.199" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">intensively so how can you you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">get up to speed in time and do something</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">interesting and then move on to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">something totally different that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">fun</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">yeah i mean you wouldn&#39;t end up forming</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">the deep relationships with students</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">probably um but you could potentially do</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">educational experimentation where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">know i think faculty teach</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">you know four or five of the eight</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">blocks a year i&#39;m making that number up</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly not all eight</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">um because they have governance and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">have research expectations and all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">um but you know if for instance you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">like okay i&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna do three iterations of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">thing this year</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">and um you know especially interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.520" style="s2">maybe although this just makes it less</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">well controlled but you know if it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.520" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">a field component i&#39;m gonna do one in</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">the fall one in the winter one in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">spring</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">and um you know the thing that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">entirely uncontrolled always is if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">students are different the program is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">different it just is i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">how much you think you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">delivering the same information into</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">empty vessels who are students</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">no the students are going to respond</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">differently to different material</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">and it could be very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">notice how things change</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">with a different complement of of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">students when you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">sort of trying to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:29.440" style="s2">repeatedly yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">i that i have some dread over the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.440" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">repeatedly from the idea that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">supposed to run the same lab</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">several times which was always a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">nightmare you know i</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">almost never ended up doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">it was so nightmarish but</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">i did yeah one one year i taught a three</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">three person program</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">um and it was it was i was doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">vertebrate evolution including</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">comparative anatomy and systematics i</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">was teaching systematics and so i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">doing computer labs for just a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">uh teaching them</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">aspects of i don&#39;t remember what mclaid</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">whatever the actual powerful systematic</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">software was at the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">um and the way we had it each of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">three faculty had each of the three</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">groups of students</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">um that day so like for three thursdays</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">running i had to teach the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">lab three times and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">systematics which is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s actual origin of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">species stuff like how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">discern differences</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">um relationships in history you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:26.880" style="s2">that uh when i when we make the claim</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">that mammals and birds separately</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.880" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">evolved endothermy on what basis do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">make that claim so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s that sort of thinking um and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:37.039" style="s2">would seem perfectly tuned to a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">dull and dry</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.039" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">analysis but who wants to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not interesting and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">life this is the evolution of life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">so exciting and wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">but um truth be told the third time in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">day you&#39;re going over</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">why it is that you&#39;re walking students</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">through you know building a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">data set of characters and taxa for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">lab it can begin to seem pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">pretty tedious yeah i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">amazing as</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">he was even god only did it once</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good joke</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">all right where are we we are at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">discord the question that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">the discord</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">server this week voted on there</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">what are some of the major blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">of modern medicine how can an</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">evolutionary approach the human body</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:21.120" style="s2">ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">these shortcomings and what are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">currently seeing opt where are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">currently seeing optimism in this regard</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">little question guys thanks for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">so also answered your question in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">question which is marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">the fact that evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">shows up so lightly in medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">not at all in clinical psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">almost not at all in dentistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">or ophthalmology is the problem right</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">this has</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:52.640" style="s2">such huge implications for the way the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">body works and therefore the way the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.640" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">fails it has huge implications for what</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">we ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">doing differently to prevent pathologies</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">rather than always playing catch-up and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">trying to treat them</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">so the big flaw if i remember your</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">question correctly</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">is the fact that these fields have not</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">been updated for darwinian thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">period and the opportunity is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">immense why why does no medical school</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">teach from a darwinian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">it would it would be the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">medical school almost instantly if it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">figured out how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">so um this is the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">two depending on how you count of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">chapters of the book that we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">working on the third draft of right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">specifically what is it that medicine</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.600" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">has done right and how</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">is its evolutionary blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">manifesting and how therefore as users</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:44.720" style="s2">of a medical system as most as all of us</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:46.559" style="s2">are can we better</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">understand our own health and make</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">better decisions and help our doctors</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">make better decisions for us</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">um zach if you would put on screen uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">for a moment just this paper just came</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">weird bodies mismatched medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">missing diversity</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">by a guy named michael girvin who i</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">don&#39;t recognize but also daniel</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">lieberman</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">who&#39;s who was the chair i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">he still is the chair of department of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">human evolutionary biology at harvard</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">he also wrote an extraordinary book that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">i used to teach with called the story of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">the human body</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">and and he&#39;s also i believe a long</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">distance runner and so specifically is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">has a research focus on um</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">skeletal and specifically foot formation</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">in early human evolution and whether or</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:28.720" style="s2">long um running and walking um helped</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">form our modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">skeletons with all of its uh pros and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">cons he&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">famously barefoot long distance runner</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">am i correct</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">i am i think so but i&#39;m not positive</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">um so let me just say one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">about this so this is this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">that i recommend that has some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">answers to the question weird bodies</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">mismatch medicine and missing diversity</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">weird before here um but that weird is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">an acronym</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">standing for western educated</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.600" style="s2">industrialized rich and democratic so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a stand-in for</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">you know rather than just saying you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:05.919" style="s2">know the west uh which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">a totally accurate description of um</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.919" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">set of demographic and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">parameters are that are descriptive of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">having the kinds of remarkable blind</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">spots especially evolutionary blind</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">spots that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">many of us have all right all right</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">um next question trump&#39;s move to halt</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">critical race theory training is both</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">bold</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">and the timing seems almost enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">have we been underestimating his</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">intelligence or does he have an</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">intuition that helped him make a smart</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">move in an opportune moment in history</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:38.240" style="s2">yeah i mean we&#39;ve in fact i think you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">mentioned last time at the time before</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.240" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve called him a political savant and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">and was calling him that not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">at the point of the last election but</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">fairly shortly after that um at which</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">point i could</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">you know at that point i hadn&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">anything to recommend him</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">at all you know this move um this move</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">and others since i do see</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">i do see that he has made some some</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">moves that are not just politically</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">savvy but also</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">what i would say are the right moves um</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">so this this strikes me as perfectly in</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">keeping with that and you know is he</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">more than that is he more than a savant</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">uh this is this is something that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:15.679" style="s2">addressed i think last time</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">well so i&#39;ve been calling him a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.679" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">political genius and i&#39;ve been telling</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">the left that they need to wise up</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">because to the extent that they treat</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">him as a fool they keep underestimating</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">and handing him lots of tools</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">and also in this case as in some others</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">handing him the moral high ground which</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">is not something</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">that the democrats should want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">yet they do it again and again</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">so in this case we have the right move</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">we have the politically savvy</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">move being the same move so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">know what motivated this and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">question that i have</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">is what happens when a guy like trump</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">makes the right move and gets lauded for</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">will he develop a taste you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">can we train him our trump supporting</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">viewers will</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">bristle at this discussion because i</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">think you and i both feel that trump</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.919" style="s2">is i would say an entirely cynical actor</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s always wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right um but it means that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">motivation</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">is advancing the political ball this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">where his genius is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">um but to the extent that the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">is to i mean the only thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">is to take the most essential machinery</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">of civilization and immunize it from</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">this insanity</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">however you do that so this must be done</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">the fact that lots of us are looking you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">know lots of us from across the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">political spectrum who are paying</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">off the plane with so much more hair</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">than you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">had left with that i was uh i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">recognized you but it took a moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">yeah that was like it it was uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">valley level</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">difference right a lot of hair it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">lot of hair yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">okay um when gender-critical folks</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">say gender doesn&#39;t exist might this not</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">be shorthand for individual versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">population level differences</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">rather than blank slatism</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">wow i think you&#39;re giving people a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">of credit um</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">yeah i think they say sex doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">they they love</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:35.679" style="s2">the well who cares about the language i</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">think they can play</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.679" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">they confuse the language intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">is it possible that some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">trying to wield these tools or trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">do so carefully</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">and might if you presented them with</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">that analysis that it&#39;s individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">versus population level</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">mean that maybe but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">the vast majority of them don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">that yeah and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">subtle but correct argument</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:04.559" style="s2">that that emerges as people challenge</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">you and you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.559" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">no i think you&#39;re hearing me incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">this is actually what i&#39;m saying and i</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">i think the chances that you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">running into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">true nuanced argument that we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">failed to spot</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">in conversation after conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">right we&#39;re pretty good at spotting what</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">a student means for example</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">rather than what they&#39;ve said you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">pulling the value out of a question and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">reframing it and so we we would hear it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:33.200" style="s2">if it were there no i mean the level of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">confusion like okay you can say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.200" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">just a tweet but that one i showed in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">the last hour</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">about this the idea that trans women</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">which is to say natal men experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">period symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">and any naysayers should sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:48.720" style="s2">shut up because not enough science has</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">been done like</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.720" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s so missing reality at so many</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">levels</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">like it just is incoherent there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">like population versus individual level</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">differences there that person wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">know what a population was if it hit him</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">in the head</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">i mean you know i&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">periods and episodes</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">and uh you know i&#39;ve had the occasional</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">era but um you&#39;ve been hysterical</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">i have been hysterical can you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">um yeah etymologically that&#39;s an awkward</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">one for me but um</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">in any way going through periods isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">uh now that you mentioned it yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">it is awkward</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">but um but yeah the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way we can play</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">language games all day yes but</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">physiology games those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">a whole different level well and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">on on to unwitting children in in part</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">uh with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">with the hormone blockers and you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">the idea that puberty is optional this</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">is a sign that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">in some of the protests now puberty is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">optional no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">yeah any child</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">young person even you know of age adult</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">who thinks that has been woefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">mistreated by the system they just they</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">got no education at all and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">uh if you&#39;re a parent do not believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">this yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">not optional it is uh unwitting children</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">who are being damaged by</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">half-witting adults</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m going with that yeah i like</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:22.079" style="s2">that that&#39;s good that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">if an immense giant wait what and my</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.079" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">trackpad has stopped working</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.440" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">okay so i can&#39;t even really see it</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">okay it&#39;s actually gonna do that and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">gonna just like look over your</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">mic here if an immense giant thousands</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">of miles tall was in space</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">and capable of physically grabbing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">earth like a ball what would it feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">like to him</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">would it be heavy delicate wet hot</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">how would he describe it um</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">so still not working</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">all right i know i&#39;m working on it i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">try it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">unfortunately when it&#39;s off it works and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:02.800" style="s2">when it&#39;s on it doesn&#39;t yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re getting lost in trackpad</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.800" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to understand the question</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a giant yeah we got a giant</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a giant</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">thousands of miles tall in space</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2">capable of physically grabbing the earth</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">like a ball what would it feel like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.800" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">him so thousands of miles tall does not</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">inherently get you it&#39;s still dwarfed by</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">unless it&#39;s depends on how many</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.800" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">thousands of miles exactly so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">what&#39;s the diameter of the earth uh the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:29.119" style="s2">diameter of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">no well let&#39;s see the circumference did</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">you just say three thousand seconds no i</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">said twenty-three</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">yeah circumference is like 27 000 which</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">means that the diameter will be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">something like a third of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">yeah um so we would need tens of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">thousands</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.240" style="s2">to hundreds of thousands just we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.599" style="s2">talking about like baseball-sized earth</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.240" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">then it&#39;s hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.599" end="00:35:51.680" style="s2">but you also i mean there&#39;s no i mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.880" style="s2">the giant himself is creating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.680" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">gravitational pull</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.880" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">right so that was the giant like so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">question include the giant&#39;s gravity</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t and so like he&#39;s just in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">space which means</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">like what it doesn&#39;t feel heavy or light</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">so the earth would stick</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">to the giant because the hand would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">similar in mass</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">to the giant&#39;s hand they would stick to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">gravitationally and presumably the giant</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">is now in orbit around the sun</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">right as the giant lifts the earth there</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">is a proportional movement presumably</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">the giant is many times the mass of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">earth and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">moves much less than the earth but there</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">would be some balance</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">between their motion as the giant moved</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">the giant is not standing on anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">right but i don&#39;t know what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">moves less like if the giant is holding</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">the earth they both move</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">as they move no if the giant</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">takes the earth and elevates his hand</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">the giant will move down and the earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">will move</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">oh relative yes yes okay but just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">hand and the earth removing the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">right the giant by the way we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">dead now</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">the giant yeah no and i mean the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:04.640" style="s2">a gravitational frame like there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing else that the giant is</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.640" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">standing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">means that this this is where you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:11.200" style="s2">to this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">monstrously sociopathic thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">experiment in the sense that you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">killed nearly eight billion people in an</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">instant</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">and all the hippopotamuses</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">hippopotamuses okay i&#39;m not convinced</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not hippopotami</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">but either way they&#39;re dead good point</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">yes it matters it doesn&#39;t matter now</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">but the giant will feel the earth as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">giant brings the earth</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">to himself so that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing no</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">it&#39;s a hymn we&#39;ve we&#39;ve been given the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">giants</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">sex but gender isn&#39;t real it&#39;s his sex</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">also not real real okay you win</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">but as the giant brings the earth to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">himself he will feel as if a magnetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">attraction why no yes gravitationally oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">just because of himself not because of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">too tight it&#39;s like i mean it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">hard to imagine what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">so if we go it&#39;s a baseball sized thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">what does it feel like for us to wield a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">baseball</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">no because we&#39;re standing on our</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">gravitational field reference</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing we don&#39;t intuit this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">because gravity is so freaking weak</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">now i didn&#39;t decide to make it so weak</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">but it is weak right it&#39;s coming after</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">you now table has gravity but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">cannot feel it right but the point is if</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.480" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">the table were earth scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">then its gravity would be appreciable</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">and the bigger it is the more</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">appreciable it is so a giant wielding an</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">would feel that gravity as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">magnetism</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">not much more than if he you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">decided to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">exercises you know his knee coming</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">towards his chest</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">together we have that same sticky nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">right which would decay with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">cube of the distance i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">square maybe the cube of the distance</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">so it would be a an experience which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">what the question is about</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">that was dominated by the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">fact of gravity being relevant at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">where it is essentially irrelevant at</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">human scale yeah so would it would it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">feel hot</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">well you haven&#39;t told us if the giant is</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">endothermic have you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">well now interestingly so this is tough</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">the it depends on what homeostatic set</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">point the giant is at</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">as to whether or not the earth would</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">fill well what temperature would feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">not necessarily or not because what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">feel assuming the giant is the process</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">of an evolutionary force big enough to</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">make giants</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">then the giants would it be right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">the only that&#39;s why i assume it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">the giant would be tuned to detect</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">the relative warmth and cool of objects</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">right where they net sources or net</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">sinks except this</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">is all taking place in a vacuum um</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">yeah but they&#39;re still conductive uh so</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">you can have like tactile sensory stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">in a vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">uh sure really</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">i am virtually certain i don&#39;t see why</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t i think you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">preoccupied with other things it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">breathing but yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">right yeah i see no reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to detect</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">heat were you protected from the vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.839" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">but your hand out there in the vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">i think that works um yeah you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">detect something like heat but</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">so here&#39;s certainly you could detect</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">something like wet so yeah i think it</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">would feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.599" style="s2">wet yeah yeah some parts more than</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.599" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">um but here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">the center of the earth is molten true</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">due to gravity the gravity of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">weight of all of the various pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">pressing in the pressure on the center</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:46.079" style="s2">causes the molecules</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">iron in the center to be rubbing up</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.079" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">against each other in a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">to start moving out when it&#39;s this close</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">to another giant gravitational force</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">now that&#39;s a problem that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">a problem the molten core is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">start bubbling to the surface as it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">tries to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">as it tries in its unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">gravitational way to</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.720" style="s2">uh be attracted to the to the giant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">mass yeah the crispy outside and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">chewy center is a problem now but um</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:10.000" style="s2">so the question is suppose the giant was</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">a careful giant</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">well we can hope we can help actually it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter we&#39;re all dead</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">that&#39;s true but if the giant were to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">treat the earth carefully so as not to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">squish it</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">would the giant feel heat from</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">the core what i&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:29.119" style="s2">before it started to bubbling below the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">surface</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.119" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">yes if the center oozed out you&#39;d feel</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">heat but</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">is the earth net warm as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:39.240" style="s2">heat</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">released in the center or is that a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.240" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">concentration</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">that is not a net is it not a net</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">release of heat</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">yeah i mean compared to the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">bleak coldness of space i suppose it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.359" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">would be net warm even before</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">the core started to burble to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">surface i think so but i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">be surprised if one of them physics</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">types contacts us</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">and says you&#39;ve got it wrong yep yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">have a phd in giants holding the earth</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">and i can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">totally totally by the way we hope to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">hear from you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">one of my favorite assignments that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">used to give uh back when</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">i had a regular job but you gave</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">assignments back when i gave assignments</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">um was that i would tweak the parameters</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">of the earth and i would get my students</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">to predict</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">what the evolutionary consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">those tweaks would be so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">you had an earth that was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">cube so that as it rotated</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">you had a hard edge that would cause day</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">to show up and disappear</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">you know like this um</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t think a hard edge would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">sufficient for that you still have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">oh you still get this might still going</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">to creep right well this is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">sort of conversation that we would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">um so you could do things like you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">change the tilt you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">uh make two suns you could oh this i</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">mean this kind of world building is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">i was doing when i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">creating my science fiction universe and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">yeah totally yeah and then there was the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">the granddaddy puzzle which i should</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">unveil at some point um in which i had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">series of islands around the equator of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">a planet</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">and set an evolutionary puzzle in motion</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">at one side of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">anyway that was one of my favorites yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">but this is sort of like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">it is this is sort of like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">maybe at some point we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">speaking of past assignments talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">the fraternities my</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">fictional family of beetles which are</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">haploid diploid but in which the sexes</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">that are haploid and diploid are</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">reversed having cascading effects on</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">social</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">behavior that was a tough assignment</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:38.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s fun though yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">when people when people used to claim</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">that evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.920" style="s2">was a place with no academic rigor i</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">used to think back to your assignments</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">and think they weren&#39;t talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">yeah or you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">yeah true okay uh where are we ah we did</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">giant</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">we did giant and now we&#39;re on too</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">could any high-powered equipment being</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">used by those fighting the fires</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">be the cause of the interference um i</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">think so strongly doubt it and i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">much of the firefighting here</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">was like they were pretty close they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">remarkably close given that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">in a a major you know not a giant city</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">but we&#39;re in a major metropolitan area</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">and they were remarkably close</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">uh but so much of the firefighting was</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">very low tech it was about creating um</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">you know barriers to to the fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">transmitting further</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">not remembering all the name all of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">work language that the firefighters are</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">using but</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">a lot of it was digging fire yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:36.800" style="s2">um so the only way in which i could see</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.800" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">contributing is if you had and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">know that this ever happens with</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">firefighting i assume it does not</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">but there are these flying i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">forgetting what the name of the aircraft</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">is these flying command centers with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">giant</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:59.599" style="s2">uh dish on top</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:02.960" style="s2">um for high very advanced uh military</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.599" end="00:45:04.240" style="s2">missions there used to be one parked at</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.960" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.240" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">up near the flight museum at boeing</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.119" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">field all the time but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">such a plane</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">conducting communications with a large</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">group of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">ships other planes etc potentially could</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">do something along that line so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">could even have a military option</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">operation where there was an intent to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">disrupt communications of the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">but none of this has anything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">firefighting so i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">even the planes that would be used you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">know these very dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">uh things that have uh fire retardant</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">that drop it on</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">fires i don&#39;t think would be doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">anything electromagnetic that would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">this influence but it is you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">the one thing that does line up is it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">explain the temporal phenomenon except</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">the fires continued after the rains yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">so i think we&#39;ve just fallen</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">away although i mean they they got less</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">intense like the the fires</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">they they the great they are saying that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">the fires aren&#39;t going to be fully put</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">out until the end of october</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">um because there is basically such such</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">thick detritus</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">um in which there are pits of heat uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">some of which are reaching 1200 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">fahrenheit</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">uh that are still smoldering um even</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">just i mean still i think in clackamas</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">county which is just one county away</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">from us</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">uh and you know some of some of the fire</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">suppression efforts now and this the two</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">biggest ones closest to portland are</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">still only</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">as of yesterday it was like 30 and 35</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">contained something like that i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">up those numbers but it was something</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">um and a lot of the firefighting efforts</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">in advance of the rains that came again</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:39.599" style="s2">yesterday the day before we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">digging up these pits to expose</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.599" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">some of these you know heat pits to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">rain so that that could begin to cool it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">off but</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">they weren&#39;t using it doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">i think anyone&#39;s imaginings you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">stereotyped imaginings of what</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">firefighting looks like</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">right now anyway yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">have you seen michael moore&#39;s new film</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">planet of the humans it&#39;s getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">of heat from both left and right about</p>

<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">it became a little hard to watch</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">um you know good probably 10 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">ago it seemed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">uh too one-sided interesting if this is</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">and people of color have high medical</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">yeah um uh yeah i wonder that 250 000</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">medical malpractice deaths</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">um seems high to me um but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">more than a thousand i&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s more than the number of uh people</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">killed by police every year</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">yeah you know i have seen some of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">uh yatrogenic</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:02.839" style="s2">harm numbers and they i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">they&#39;re staggeringly they are</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.839" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">staggering which you know i think we</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">careful because you don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">number to be zero</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">right because basically you have no</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">medicine at that point well</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">and just just it&#39;s a it&#39;s a harder thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">to say but i&#39;ve actually heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">um i think i&#39;ve heard sam harris say</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">this right like you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">uh the number of people killed by police</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">to be zero</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">either right right because that&#39;s airing</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">too far in the other direction well</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve either</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a true that it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">impossible to say right now but um</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">but for any of these things where</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s tragedy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">individual human tragedy reducing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">to zero means that you will create a</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">whole other kind of tragedy which</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t yet exist</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">um in its in its wake yeah i think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">easy way to see this</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">is we could reduce highway deaths to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">easily with current technology right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">they&#39;re really two ways to do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">either you prevent all driving or you</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">set speed limits so low and so that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">requirements for</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">vehicles so high that nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:06.800" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">injure anybody you know if we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.800" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">driving a tank at two miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:12.640" style="s2">right then you can get highway desk</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:15.359" style="s2">pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.640" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">pretty quick yeah sounds like a party it</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.359" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">does not and so the point is we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">made this decision</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">right yeah probably you don&#39;t go out and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">say what is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">safest possible car i could buy right</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">oh that&#39;s a very safe car and new</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">parents are more likely to veer in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">direction and this is why we have these</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">like stereotypes about the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">cars that new parents buy but even then</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">even then you are much more likely to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">to consumer reports and see</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">oh this one gets a five-star crash</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">rating rather than</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">the gas economy like the mileage is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">terrible and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">right right but you know so lots of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">people will go with i want a five-star</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">crash rating but they won&#39;t go you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:57.839" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">some car that has dismal this or that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.839" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">happens to be safer they often will not</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">buy it because we all</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">calculate that okay this risk is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">sufficiently low that now some other</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">parameter is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">um more important and you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">there is an interaction</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">if you um buy a car with cruddy mileage</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">because it just so happens that it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">the top uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">you know the safest car well then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">going to cost your</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">family in terms of how much resource it</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">has based on how much you&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">and so that will have an interaction you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">know potentially the quality of food you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">buy or something else so</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">you know even if you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">health as your top consideration</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex equation yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">but so but i mean the point which is um</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">could be read as a glib</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">is is a good one right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">for any of so just to read it again the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.200" end="00:50:52.880" style="s2">police kill about a thousand people a</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">year in contrast there are about 250 000</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.880" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">medical malpractice deaths</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">per year and people of color have higher</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">medical mortality should we start a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">movement to defund doctors</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">analogized point pick anything where</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.200" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">there are deaths that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want to happen find that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">there is disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">uh death in some demographic that has</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">been historically underserved by a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">and argue that that entire system should</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">be defunded as a result because the only</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">possible reason which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.200" style="s2">implicit here</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">the only possible reason that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.200" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">could be disproportionate effects</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">on an historically uh disadvantaged</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">group is</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">modern racism yeah systemic racism ism</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.480" end="00:51:39.280" style="s2">is yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">beautiful point i would like it even</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.280" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">just one step better if it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">abolish rather than defund because</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">yeah the real point is nobody</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">nobody including those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">very focused</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">on yatrogenic harm nobody believes that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">medicine</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">is inherently more harmful than it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:02.200" style="s2">beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">right it does lots of harm lots of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.200" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">unnecessary um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">yeah and therefore preventable but you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">the idea that abolish is the next step</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">is a non-sequitur just as it is with the</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">have you heard his argument would you</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">consider interviewing him do you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">him do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">like that name don&#39;t i have heard many</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">such arguments</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">i believe they all come apart</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">um i&#39;d be curious if there&#39;s anything to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">recommend this argument</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a lot of pressure for</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">anybody who can generate an argument</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:55.280" style="s2">casts suspicion away from</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">the wuhan institute but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way i would consider</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">interviewing him</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">but i want to know that he is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">other than a shill before i would decide</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:05.920" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">next question my daughter asked me if</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">fire is alive</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">i said not but she argued that it covers</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">all of the mrs gren</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">criteria so why isn&#39;t it i must admit</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">i&#39;m stumped</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">please help my four-year-old is</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:24.000" style="s2">outstarting outsmarting me thanks</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">so this question invokes mrs graham</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.000" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">allen capps i&#39;ve never heard this before</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">i figure this is some</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:30.880" style="s2">uh have you heard this mrs grant so this</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">is going to be some as it turns out it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.880" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:36.640" style="s2">usually elementary school although maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">where is my safari why can&#39;t i find</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">anything on this computer at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">um yeah i find it</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">um in basic biology uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">it is it is an acronym that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">have to show the sec</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">this is just some rando site it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">some i guess</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">elementary school level acronym uh that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">is being taught to people and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:02.559" style="s2">interesting um the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">that students are being taught that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.559" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">living things display certain</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">seven things beginning with the letters</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">in mrs grant</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">movement respiration sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">control homeostasis growth</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">reproduction excretion removal of waste</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">and nutrition taking in of nutrients and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:27.200" style="s2">so this strikes me as um both being</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">rather more complicated than used to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.200" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">and also missing some</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">some key things um</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if we want to just uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:37.760" style="s2">speak to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">whether or not fire is alive and go at</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.760" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">it that way but uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:47.440" style="s2">your update to dawkins for things</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">um that are um clearly products of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.440" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s evolution or</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">selection um</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">four characteristics necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">adaptive evolution</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">um so dawkins characteristics were four</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">characteristics that cause a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">so he wouldn&#39;t put it in these terms</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">yeah this is the slightly updated</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">things that cause a pattern any pattern</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">at its level of commonality so whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the number of gold atoms</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">in you know on earth or the number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:18.839" style="s2">spiral galaxies</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">in the universe there are four</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.839" end="00:55:22.240" style="s2">characteristics off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">they would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.240" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">tendency to come into existence</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">the self-similarity</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">the persistence once created</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">and then the fourth one is the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">to accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">stuff limiting stuff yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">this gets transmuted in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">uh selection and adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">by um by heredity which causes</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">adaptation to take place so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">those processes are basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:00.839" style="s2">selection and then you add heredity and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">it causes cumulative selection to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.839" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">adaptation so add heredity and you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">uh you get life or is that not</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">sufficient at that point</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">um well i have to say i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure why we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">the exercise of define life and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:23.920" style="s2">find the edge cases that throw you you</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">know what are we going to do with prions</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.920" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">okay well but we but this isn&#39;t an edge</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">case fire isn&#39;t alive so</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">so so uh this person&#39;s four-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">why isn&#39;t fire alive it covered it</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:35.359" style="s2">satisfies these seven criteria that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">was taught</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.359" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">are the criterium for for living things</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:41.760" style="s2">and i look at this list and say well</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a list of things but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">elegant as it could be and fire isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">edge case it&#39;s actually just not you</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">know prions and viruses we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:53.920" style="s2">talk about but fire is not alive so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:54.960" style="s2">what basis are we so certain that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.920" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">not even an edge case</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not so i a why is movement on that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:04.000" style="s2">does something have to move in order to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">be alive i i don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.000" end="00:57:06.640" style="s2">rule</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">i can&#39;t see why it should be unless</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.640" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">you&#39;re going to include growth</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">in movement in which case you would</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">almost by definition</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">have to grow to go from essentially no</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">dimensionality to</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">more dimensionality yeah so like i said</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t i think this</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">this acronym is not um as useful as it</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">might be but can we</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">can we either describe why it is clear</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">that fire is not alive</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">and or generate a better</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">uh simple rubric than than this one</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:39.040" style="s2">where i agree the very first letter</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">um is for something that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.040" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">to be right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">um but you know respiration um</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">also you know this the second one fire</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">um consuming oxygen but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">engaging in gas exchange so exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">something we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">in the last hour right like fire is not</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">engaging in gas exchange</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">it is consuming um consuming</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">something consuming oxygen um</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">but here here&#39;s why i&#39;m resistant to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:09.920" style="s2">exercise</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">to even describing why fire isn&#39;t alive</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.920" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">um though i agree fire is absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">alive um</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">imagine it&#39;s your four-year-old asking</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">believe me</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:21.599" style="s2">as you know i talked to both of my</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">four-year-olds this way</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.599" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">and they&#39;re now 14 and 16 and are still</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">speaking to you so although excruciating</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">at times it did work</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">yes it seems to have done it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:33.440" style="s2">work here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">at some point there was no life and some</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.440" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">process and we can talk about what that</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.079" style="s2">process might have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">then there&#39;s something that is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.079" end="00:58:42.319" style="s2">alive right and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">between those two places there is edge</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.319" end="00:58:46.559" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">so just as i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.559" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">it is certainly true that you know a</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">chicken and egg question</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">is not a real question because we know</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:57.359" style="s2">that the first chicken</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">whatever it might have been came from an</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.359" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">egg</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:02.000" style="s2">right i&#39;m perfectly happy to say that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">that is logically required</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.000" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t have done anything but come</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">from an egg because all of the ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:08.559" style="s2">that are definitely pre-chicken also</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">came out of eggs and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.559" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">descendants that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">came from it came out of eggs so coming</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">out of an egg is what it did the egg</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">preceded the chicken</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">do i want to get involved in defining</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">which step in you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">the route between the pre-chicken</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">bird ancestor and a chicken it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:32.559" style="s2">a chicken</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">that seems like a fool&#39;s paradise to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.559" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">so the fact that we can logically say</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:35.599" style="s2">that there are certain things that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:37.200" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.599" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">and that given any definition of chicken</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.200" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">there must have been a first one</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">and it did come from an egg all those</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">things are true but</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">then which one was the first chicken is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:46.559" style="s2">a question i don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">responsible for because i know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">answerable</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">and so so i get all that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">sense but fires</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">fire and life aren&#39;t on a continuum with</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">eggs and chickens are in a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">with one another they exist in the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">history and on the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.160" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">life timeline i agree fire and life</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t i agree</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">but the point is at the point that we as</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:06.319" style="s2">biologists say here are the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.319" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">that are required for life we are then</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">up against all of the places in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:13.359" style="s2">universe where life will obviously have</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">evolved and it will challenge these</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.359" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:18.079" style="s2">and so recognizing that that&#39;s coming my</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">point is there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">really a um</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">uh a set of criteria that are okay so</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">put aside the criteria</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">is it rock alive no is a quasar alive</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">no is fire alive no how do you know um</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">well for one thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:37.200" style="s2">uh they didn&#39;t come about through the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:40.640" style="s2">process that would guaranteed</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.200" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">be at their origin which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.640" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">an evolutionary adaptive process okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">so that sounded almost like a definition</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">well no because</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">as we just described the number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.040" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">quasars in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.640" end="01:00:57.760" style="s2">is the result of the four</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">characteristics that will</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">dictate how common a pattern a quasar is</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">and it is a prerequisite to life</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">to which you would have to add something</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">hereditary</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">right quasars do not beget quasars</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">quasars do not beget quasars</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">um and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:20.400" style="s2">the point at which you&#39;ve added enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">hereditary component that quasars start</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.400" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">taking on the characteristics of life is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">going to be arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.520" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">right you&#39;re going to have to draw a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:28.370" style="s2">threshold and it&#39;s going to be arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.370" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">the other thing i would say maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">is maybe this is what you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.359" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">the characteristics that tend to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">accompany</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">life is not the same thing as the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:51.520" style="s2">cinquan non of life</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">the cinquanon of life is</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.520" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">the attempt to persist</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">yes and fire doesn&#39;t give a damn</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t care whether it persists or</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">not and just so</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">caring is uh evolutionary shorthand</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.359" style="s2">for uh how&#39;s that drive to is selected</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.359" end="01:02:12.880" style="s2">right there&#39;s that need be no</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">consciousness we are not impu</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.880" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">we&#39;re not ascribing consciousness to</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">slime molds or to</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">psilocybin mushrooms or just salmon</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">they they drive to persist which</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:29.760" style="s2">involves both survival and reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:30.480" style="s2">and fire is uh is doing no such thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.760" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.480" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">to this way if we look at some slime</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">molds a good example okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">slime molds are critters that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:43.760" style="s2">forage independently it&#39;s an oozy</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">forest critter that breaks apart</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.760" end="01:02:47.039" style="s2">and forages independently which gives it</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">certain advantages</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.039" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">and at the point that it detects that</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">it&#39;s about to run out of food</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a chemical signal that causes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">to reconvene</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">and fruit so that spores which are</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:00.880" style="s2">escaping the patch that is now about to</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.880" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">try to find another patch that may be</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">the most beautiful description of slime</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">thank you um but the point is if you saw</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">fire doing this</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">as fire let&#39;s say you see fire a brush</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">fire okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">brush fire is climbing a hill right as</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">it gets to the top of the hill it knows</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s about to run out of fuel</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">right because it will have burned the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:25.599" style="s2">stuff on the side if it were alive</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">it would know somehow right we can know</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.599" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">we can the fire does not know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:31.200" style="s2">know that no yes now i&#39;ve just stepped</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">in our house</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.200" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">yes i do okay if the fire behaved as if</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">it knew</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">yes if the fire went into a very uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">ember generating form at the point it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">climbed to the top of the hill because</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:47.039" style="s2">it was about to expire</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.079" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">for lack of fuel and those um you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.039" end="01:03:50.000" style="s2">jumping embers were more likely to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">it onto some other hill</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.000" end="01:03:54.480" style="s2">and you could say actually it&#39;s behaving</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">as as as if it were alive</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.480" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">and then yes although i mean evidence of</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">selection acting on it is obviously not</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">the same thing as being alive this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:03.280" style="s2">the point you have made</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:04.880" style="s2">repeatedly with regard to say that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.280" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">know the the organization of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.880" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">rocks on the show on a seashore that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:10.480" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:11.839" style="s2">um that they organize by size not</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.480" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">because they are alive not because they</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.839" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">have any intention of liking to be with</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:18.079" style="s2">rocks of their own size but because</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:19.680" style="s2">the physical forces of the waves provide</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">a selective force</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:23.680" style="s2">so it is not the evidence that selection</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">has acted on them that would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.680" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">life in the case of a fire that acted in</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">a self-preserving way</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">as it got to the top of the hill is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">evidence of adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">yes right so</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">somewhere in there it is the clear</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:39.599" style="s2">evidence that adaptation accounts for</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.599" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">and how would you detect adaptation is</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">in a manner so as to arrange persistence</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:52.880" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think that there was hardly</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:55.280" style="s2">anything in there</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.880" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">that you know we we may well have talked</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.280" end="01:04:57.359" style="s2">to our children when they were four like</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:04:59.039" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.359" end="01:05:00.960" style="s2">even they because they were accustomed</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.039" end="01:05:02.400" style="s2">to being talked to like that from</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.960" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">a very young age i don&#39;t think would</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.400" end="01:05:05.440" style="s2">have really tracked that so i would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">to tim</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.440" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">who says his four-year-old is</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">outsmarting me um</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">presumably you could you could track all</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">of that or you&#39;ll be able to if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:16.720" style="s2">listen to it again</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:18.079" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t hear anything in there</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.720" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s actually easy to explain to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.079" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">four-year-old so</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">let me uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:30.160" style="s2">let me say it this way you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">complex systems and complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.160" end="01:05:35.039" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">okay complex systems include things like</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.039" end="01:05:40.640" style="s2">fire weather</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">right these are phenomena that have</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">complexity to them</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:48.559" style="s2">but they do not have adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.760" style="s2">capacity those things that have adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.559" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.760" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">are things in which purpose</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:59.280" style="s2">is evident right the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.559" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">of a cat is to produce more cats now</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.280" end="01:06:03.039" style="s2">ultimately the purpose is for the cat</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">lineage to persist into the future</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.039" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">but nonetheless the cat behaves in a way</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">that is purposeful</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">and my point about fire is that the fire</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:11.920" style="s2">if it behaved in a way that was</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:13.680" style="s2">purposeful</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.920" end="01:06:15.520" style="s2">if fire was living and we just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.680" end="01:06:18.240" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured that out yet</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.520" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">then it might behave in a way so that as</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.240" end="01:06:21.839" style="s2">it faced extinction at the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:23.599" style="s2">hill it arranged preservation through</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.839" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">some sort of reproductive</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.599" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">feat right and the point is the fire</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.559" style="s2">climbing the hill will behave exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">the same way</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:34.559" style="s2">even if that hill leads to another oops</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">to another hill</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.559" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">as it would facing its extinction so it</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">does nothing to arrange its persistence</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:42.880" style="s2">yeah the slime mold has an interest in</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">persistence not that it could tell you</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.880" end="01:06:45.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">right a fire has no interest in its own</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.119" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">persistence and it also couldn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">you that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">right but the behavior can tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:53.520" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;re over an hour already my goodness</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.520" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">we haven&#39;t even got oh boy</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">you you should you should have told us</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">something man um</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">okay uh let&#39;s do two more here and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:06.880" style="s2">try to get to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.960" end="01:07:08.000" style="s2">several um on the next live stream on</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.880" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">the next on</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.000" end="01:07:11.680" style="s2">super chat from right now should the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">military get involved in the event of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.680" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">post-election unrest um</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">and then a separate question did you</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">check household electric current quality</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:21.440" style="s2">radiation would affect the neighbors</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:22.559" style="s2">with precision electronics too so i</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.440" end="01:07:25.839" style="s2">don&#39;t think we ended up talking to our</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.559" end="01:07:25.839" style="s2">neighbors during the smoke down</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">uh i certainly attempted to check it uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">i&#39;m limited with respect to tools</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think there was anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:36.319" style="s2">to our electric power oh in fact we know</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.880" end="01:07:36.799" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t electric power because we</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.319" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">tried</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">everything on battery and even when we</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">were completely disconnected from</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">um from electric current coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">wall we still have the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s right you did you did try that</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">yeah okay should the military get</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.839" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">involved in the event of post-election</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:52.640" style="s2">unrest</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">depends on the unrest oh boy yeah and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.640" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">mean there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be unrest</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:57.680" style="s2">no matter the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">um but you know you know i feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.680" end="01:08:01.839" style="s2">both sides</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:03.359" style="s2">have uh have now seeded the idea that uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.839" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t trust the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.359" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s coming from both sides they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:07.200" style="s2">setting us up it&#39;s it&#39;s a disaster it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:14.000" style="s2">as if they suck beyond all recognition</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:14.559" style="s2">almost no actually we&#39;re there we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.000" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.559" end="01:08:18.480" style="s2">they suck beyond all recognition yeah</p>

<p begin="01:08:18.480" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">yeah a while ago some of us came up with</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.040" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">a drinking game for the streams</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">if someone says something can get them</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">canceled you drink</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">what do we call it no suggestions that</p>

<p begin="01:08:30.480" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">drinking game for the streams</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">which we call it if you say something</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">you get if you say something they could</p>

<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">because lowercase letters mean the date</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">is uncalibrated</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">when we do know actually what it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">brett&#39;s going to look it up while i</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:09.920" style="s2">slowly read the next question from</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">our friend holly mathnerd asks seeing</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.920" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">non-idiots argue that trump is a wannabe</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">dictator</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">even after his covet response was that</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">not a damn near perfect falsification</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:21.840" style="s2">if so what the [ __ ] um</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:25.360" style="s2">so did you hear that question i did are</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.159" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">you too immersed</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.360" end="01:10:28.880" style="s2">um having trouble getting my device to</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:33.040" style="s2">behave</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.880" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">yeah uh yeah his covered response was</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.040" end="01:10:36.960" style="s2">was terrible um and i&#39;m not sure that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.960" end="01:10:41.360" style="s2">like i&#39;ve never thought he was a wannabe</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:42.320" style="s2">dictator um so i&#39;m not in that camp but</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.360" end="01:10:44.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:45.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that his really terrible</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.320" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">coveted response</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.760" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">is totally incompatible with him being a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:52.159" style="s2">dictator and i say that as someone who</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t think he wants to be a dictator</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.159" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">um i mean just it would it would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">that he was incompetent at it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:10:59.600" style="s2">right but it was also a missed</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">opportunity for a would-be dictator</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.600" end="01:11:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m saying he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">incompetent like he missed the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.600" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">but i mean dictate i think the point is</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:10.560" style="s2">a dictator would be looking</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:13.760" style="s2">for a crisis with which to justify</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.560" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">an authoritarian remake of this that and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.760" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">the other he&#39;d be looking for emergency</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:19.440" style="s2">powers and he&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">um yeah yeah although i mean he could</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.440" end="01:11:23.440" style="s2">also see presumably like you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">one of the things actually in his skill</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.440" end="01:11:27.280" style="s2">set presumably is</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:28.800" style="s2">um you know he it appeared that he was</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">much more focused on the effects on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.800" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">economy than it was in the effects of</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">people who would be affected by the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">by the pathogen and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:41.679" style="s2">a dictator doesn&#39;t dictate for long in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">totally failed economy</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.679" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:48.800" style="s2">emergency powers he would have</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">used um while also keeping the economy</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.800" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">going strong i don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s such a mess it&#39;s a mess but i do</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something to be said</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">for the fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">that uh dictator of one stripe or</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:01.600" style="s2">another you would have expected a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:04.080" style="s2">different response to cover than we saw</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.600" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">which was way too political and inept</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.080" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t look like somebody looking to</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:11.520" style="s2">grab power yep</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:14.239" style="s2">did you look up prop 16 or were you not</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">able to i wasn&#39;t able to find it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.239" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">if if you like maybe um i asked the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">question a few episodes ago just wanted</p>

<p begin="01:12:34.880" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">bringing up so many negative emotions</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">that really anything you did on top of</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:43.360" style="s2">liability no no it&#39;s this this person</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">asking a question about evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.360" end="01:12:46.400" style="s2">i mean i think for me more than brett i</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">think it</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.400" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">thinking about what it was makes me</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:53.280" style="s2">wistful you know i i</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">i still do miss parts of what we could</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.280" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">do there</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">and and the life that we created for</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:13:01.760" style="s2">ourselves and our children</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:05.040" style="s2">and um and uh to have it</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.760" end="01:13:06.960" style="s2">taken with uh no apparent</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.040" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">choice no he kept it under control all</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.960" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">right he&#39;s being responsible</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">um was uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">it&#39;s still a little bit heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">but well</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:19.440" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing there now that i would</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:22.800" style="s2">recognize i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.440" end="01:13:26.560" style="s2">wistful for what it was but i am aware</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.800" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">uh of what it has become uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.560" end="01:13:31.040" style="s2">i think it was so nasty to us as it came</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:34.480" style="s2">apart and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.040" end="01:13:38.719" style="s2">duplicitous and disloyal that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.480" end="01:13:40.400" style="s2">um no part of me wants to go back the</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.719" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">part that mattered was the students and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.400" end="01:13:43.199" style="s2">we&#39;re still in contact with a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">number of them and</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.199" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">anyway yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.159" end="01:13:51.520" style="s2">um maybe so maybe we should yeah why</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">don&#39;t we just move on and we&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.520" end="01:13:55.840" style="s2">back to it</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.159" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">next time what do you think about humans</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.840" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">about humans diet evolution i imagine a</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">balanced diet wasn&#39;t attainable for</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">people through most of human evolution</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">our humans get biome specialized to</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.080" end="01:14:07.520" style="s2">their region for instance our russians</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">better adapted to eating potatoes</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.520" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">so this is another chapter in our</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:13.520" style="s2">upcoming book one which i just edited a</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">couple days ago in the food chapter</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.520" end="01:14:19.440" style="s2">the very short answer is</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:20.159" style="s2">there is no single diet that is best</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:23.199" style="s2">adapted</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.159" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">to humans it is going to be impossible</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.199" end="01:14:26.880" style="s2">because we have evolved in many</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.480" end="01:14:29.199" style="s2">different places in many different ways</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.880" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">you take a mediterranean diet to which</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.199" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">mediterranean peoples are presumably</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">well suited and you try feeding it to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.600" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">who is inuit and they are not going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.760" end="01:14:38.800" style="s2">be as healthy as they would if you gave</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">them a diet</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.800" end="01:14:43.679" style="s2">primarily of seal um not that many</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">modern inuits would necessarily want a</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.679" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">diet entirely of seal but</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:48.480" style="s2">uh there are going to be differences</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.480" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">um there are adaptations to an</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:54.000" style="s2">agricultural lifestyle that are present</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:56.320" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.320" end="01:15:01.840" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.239" end="01:15:03.120" style="s2">i think the number is a copy of an</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.840" end="01:15:05.760" style="s2">allele</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.120" end="01:15:07.280" style="s2">that converts amylose which is the</p>

<p begin="01:15:07.280" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">to its constituent parts to sugars</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:14.719" style="s2">through the enzyme amylase</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">i believe that chips have three copies</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.719" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">of this allele and that most human</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">populations have five</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:21.280" style="s2">suggesting that we are actually well</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">adapted to this that you know the idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.280" end="01:15:27.280" style="s2">for instance a paleo diet</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">in which we only eat animals and leaves</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.280" end="01:15:30.719" style="s2">is the only best way to be human nope</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:32.640" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.719" end="01:15:34.080" style="s2">is it healthy for some people sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.640" end="01:15:35.679" style="s2">absolutely are there some diets that</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.080" end="01:15:37.840" style="s2">people are eating now that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.679" end="01:15:39.440" style="s2">absolutely but there&#39;s not going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.840" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">best diet for all humans nor is there</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.440" end="01:15:43.600" style="s2">going to be a best diet</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:45.360" style="s2">for you even across your lifespan</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:46.320" style="s2">because you you will change in your</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.320" end="01:15:51.280" style="s2">as you age so with respect to the exact</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">question we cannot say whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:54.560" style="s2">russians are better adapted to eat</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:56.400" style="s2">potatoes but probably they are well</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.560" end="01:15:58.080" style="s2">adapted to drinking potatoes they do</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.400" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">seem to be yes yes better at least</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.080" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">adapted than most of the rest of us</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:04.840" style="s2">yes to the point of ending up under the</p>

<p begin="01:16:04.840" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">later um</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.800" end="01:16:12.159" style="s2">i&#39;m interested to hear you two talk [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.199" end="01:16:13.520" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.159" end="01:16:15.679" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard the stomach is evolving</p>

<p begin="01:16:15.679" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">number two is a daily process but it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:20.640" style="s2">rarely discussed</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.960" style="s2">is there any gut biome information we</p>

<p begin="01:16:22.960" end="01:16:26.400" style="s2">so i&#39;ve never heard that the stomach is</p>

<p begin="01:16:28.000" end="01:16:31.840" style="s2">um such analyses it&#39;s sort of like um</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.800" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.840" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">re-upping your immune system with</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.360" end="01:16:45.040" style="s2">simplest approach</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.480" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">to this question i guess would be 20</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.040" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">we really thought most you know medical</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">professionals and scientists who were</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">thinking about the human body thought</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:54.320" style="s2">that humans were just individuals</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.040" end="01:16:56.000" style="s2">and it turns out that we contain</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.320" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">multitudes right it&#39;s a biblical</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.000" end="01:16:58.480" style="s2">reference but it&#39;s just true that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:16:59.840" style="s2">contain</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.480" end="01:17:02.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t have any idea what the order of</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.840" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">magnitude is but um</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.320" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">more than hundreds of thousands i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:10.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">microbes in our our guts on other places</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:15.600" style="s2">help us process and digest types of</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">microbes</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.600" end="01:17:18.560" style="s2">no i was i was talking about numbers i</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:20.480" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t think that we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.560" end="01:17:21.920" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of species of</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.480" end="01:17:23.840" style="s2">microbes but</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.920" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">but the order of magnitude of the number</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.840" end="01:17:28.400" style="s2">of individuals is</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.040" end="01:17:29.040" style="s2">absolutely astronomical it&#39;s close uh i</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.400" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.040" end="01:17:32.320" style="s2">to the number of cells that we have in</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">the body by virtue of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.320" end="01:17:34.880" style="s2">microbes in question are bacteria and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.880" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">very tiny relative to our cells so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:40.320" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.000" end="01:17:41.440" style="s2">trillions so certainly more than</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.320" end="01:17:45.040" style="s2">hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.440" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">yep um i i am not sure about that number</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.040" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:48.719" style="s2">like i said i don&#39;t even know how to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:49.920" style="s2">close on the order of magnitude um i</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.719" end="01:17:50.159" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.920" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.159" end="01:17:53.199" style="s2">species of pipes um i don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.400" end="01:17:56.320" style="s2">either but</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.199" end="01:17:56.800" style="s2">um you know we now know that this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:17:59.120" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.800" end="01:18:01.440" style="s2">about our for instance our our gut</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.120" end="01:18:03.760" style="s2">microbiota our microfauna</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.440" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">but we still don&#39;t know most of what</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.760" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">that means about</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:08.880" style="s2">how we should be keeping that gut fauna</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:15.760" style="s2">and and how else we should be you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">eating and drinking and and [ __ ] so</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.760" end="01:18:19.520" style="s2">that we are</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:20.400" style="s2">the healthiest so uh one thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.520" end="01:18:22.560" style="s2">certainly true</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.400" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">is that it is worth thinking about where</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.560" end="01:18:26.080" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:27.920" style="s2">gut flora come from right we are</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.080" end="01:18:32.080" style="s2">colonized very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.920" end="01:18:34.159" style="s2">uh on birth and what we are colonized by</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.080" end="01:18:36.000" style="s2">has a big implication on how well we</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.159" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">function and so it is possible that by</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.000" end="01:18:40.000" style="s2">virtue of the fact that we live in</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:42.080" style="s2">novel circumstances in which we will get</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.000" end="01:18:45.120" style="s2">colonized in novel ways by</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.080" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">haphazard sets of of bacteria</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.120" end="01:18:49.120" style="s2">results in you know a lifetime of misery</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">for people that we don&#39;t even notice</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.120" end="01:18:54.960" style="s2">again this would be a perfect place for</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:55.760" style="s2">medicine to get darwinian and to</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.960" end="01:18:57.520" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.760" end="01:18:59.199" style="s2">you know i mean we are increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.520" end="01:19:00.560" style="s2">seeing stuff like fecal transplants and</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.199" end="01:19:03.840" style="s2">things for people who have</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.560" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">yep mismatched gut flora and i would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.840" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2">the farther you go down this road the</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.120" end="01:19:08.400" style="s2">more you&#39;re going to discover that there</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.400" end="01:19:10.960" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.400" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">an important we are doing something that</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.960" end="01:19:14.960" style="s2">is the opposite of fine tuned</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:16.480" style="s2">and there is an important fine tuning to</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.960" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">be happen and probably</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.480" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">um once you have the right flora</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:25.600" style="s2">treating it properly cultivating it by</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">feeding yourself stuff that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.600" end="01:19:30.239" style="s2">naturally well tuned to</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">yeah eating ferment and such yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.239" end="01:19:37.520" style="s2">um as scatman crothers says in</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.360" end="01:19:41.040" style="s2">the movie version of the shining</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.520" end="01:19:44.400" style="s2">uh what does he say he says</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.040" end="01:19:45.840" style="s2">um something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.400" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to be regular if</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.840" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be happy or something he</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:49.679" style="s2">says that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">he&#39;s touring them it seems like a</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.679" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">lighthearted line from the shining</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.440" end="01:19:55.920" style="s2">well it&#39;s early in the shining before uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">you know all work and no play made jack</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.920" end="01:19:59.199" style="s2">a dull boy</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">yeah but yeah scatman crothers his</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.199" end="01:20:04.239" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:07.679" style="s2">is touring them through</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.239" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">the overlook hotel and showing them the</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.679" end="01:20:11.679" style="s2">kitchens and i don&#39;t know i was</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">showing them prunes or something he says</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.679" end="01:20:15.040" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.800" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">uh just one one more comment on this uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.040" end="01:20:18.960" style="s2">you had mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:22.000" style="s2">that uh the process of being born</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.960" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">effectively provides a number of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.000" end="01:20:25.920" style="s2">of the microbes that you then have in</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">your early life and it actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.920" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">presumably colonizes uh your life for</p>

<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:50.000" style="s2">get bathed in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.360" end="01:20:50.800" style="s2">yeah in the the fauna of your mother</p>

<p begin="01:22:58.960" end="01:23:02.880" style="s2">and at least we will still have some</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.719" end="01:23:03.679" style="s2">school that knows how to build a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.880" end="01:23:06.080" style="s2">or a building</p>
