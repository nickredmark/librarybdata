<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.929" style="s2">welcome to our review of the year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:06.029" style="s2">nearly New Year so we&#39;re going to look</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:08.280" style="s2">back over the films that you put out on</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.029" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">the channel and try and kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.280" end="00:00:12.440" style="s2">whether there&#39;s a narrative two of them</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">or maybe we can impose a narrative on it</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.440" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">and I think there is I mean I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">out sort of what the main films were</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">that we put out like what was most</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">viewed we&#39;re going to play some clips</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:23.100" style="s2">from then we&#39;re going to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.189" style="s2">little bit of the kind of backstory</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.100" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">behind some of the films and try and see</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.189" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">where where what the trajectory of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">channel has been over the last year and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:33.329" style="s2">maybe where we&#39;re going next</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:34.680" style="s2">yes since the beginning of the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.329" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">we very much felt that we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.680" end="00:00:39.960" style="s2">following an unfolding narrative sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">following whatever feels most alive in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.960" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">the culture and trying to keep that sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">of generative quality of exploration</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">yeah so looking back across the year has</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">been quite an interesting exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">seeing okay is there a narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">binds everything together that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">been covering there&#39;s often as often we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">are I think responding to what feels</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">alive and going on intuition as well as</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">intellect but in the moment things</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">happen very fast in culture and looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">back on it I think there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">threads we&#39;ve been covering so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">been covering from the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:13.020" style="s2">channel the sense of how do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">real conversation that takes us</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">somewhere new so a lot of the content</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve had is in some way related to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">from the intellectual dark web to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">science psychology of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.939" style="s2">collective intelligence so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">thread and I think there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.939" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">thread of the shadows in culture what</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:30.900" style="s2">are the aspects that of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">culturally and individually that we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.900" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">to own and look at and bring out so</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">that&#39;s been another key theme not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">wanting to give away too much about</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">what&#39;s coming up later but let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">in January with the Gillette advert and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">we were actually out in Thailand at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">time we&#39;re doing a working holiday in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">Thailand and then the Gillette ad came</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">out and there was this huge kind of up</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">swirl of like it was a major cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">moment at the time so I guess I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">frame this film that we&#39;re doing now</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be we&#39;ve done a whole series</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">called men and women after me - based on</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">the premise that if the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">conversation right now looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">dysfunctional relationship and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">it does what does a functional</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">relationship look like and just for</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s been living under a stone</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:12.250" style="s2">for the last couple of days and hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.750" style="s2">seen this I mean the amount of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.250" end="00:02:15.940" style="s2">it&#39;s had it was up to about nine million</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.750" end="00:02:18.820" style="s2">views in a very short space of time at</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.940" end="00:02:21.460" style="s2">two days hugely polarized reactions it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.820" end="00:02:23.740" style="s2">was running about 10 to 1 dislikes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.460" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">light ratio it&#39;s now up to about 4 to 1</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.740" end="00:02:30.760" style="s2">let&#39;s start by talking about the film</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">itself yes because it was done by a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.760" end="00:02:37.720" style="s2">high-profile director Kim Gehrig so a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">female director who did a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.720" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">well-received and very successful</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:46.120" style="s2">campaign called this girl can and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:47.380" style="s2">going to play a little clip from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.120" end="00:02:48.970" style="s2">now and we&#39;ll just sort of then unpack</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.380" end="00:02:53.380" style="s2">the differences and what it says about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.970" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">the cultural context I&#39;m the hottest</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.380" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">wave jockey stop me now</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:09.300" style="s2">this girl can&#39;t I think is a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">campaign it actually by death by pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.300" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">much any definition was a great campaign</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">it took a real need and a real issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">which is women feeling like they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:18.330" style="s2">want to exercise because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.250" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">feel confident their bodies they felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.330" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">people were watching them I have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">of female friends who told me about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:24.330" style="s2">about the kind of feeling especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:26.340" style="s2">like in the freeway section of the gym</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.330" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">like I really want to go in there so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">took that need he did a great campaign</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:32.790" style="s2">around it and they go something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">well according to an award entry they</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.790" end="00:03:37.709" style="s2">did you know 1.6 million women doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:40.549" style="s2">exercise attributable to some way in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.709" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">that to that campaign which is great so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.549" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">really different response to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:47.850" style="s2">Gillette ad and I think part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">because so this girl can everything in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.850" end="00:03:50.819" style="s2">there is aspirational is this girl can</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:53.160" style="s2">do this she can do this she can do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.819" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s you know kind of don&#39;t hold me down</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.160" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">great very empowering nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:00.590" style="s2">that did you let ad if it&#39;s this girl</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.630" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">can it&#39;s very much these men should</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.590" end="00:04:05.640" style="s2">completely different energy to it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">you mentioned catch-22 which is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.640" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">of feeling that I take away from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">Gillette ad the ad coming out and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">the reaction afterwards in the backlash</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">in the backlash against the backlash and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">what was really fascinating is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.950" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">this narrative in the culture certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">it&#39;s a progressive culture that men need</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:25.140" style="s2">to be more emotionally honest they need</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:26.430" style="s2">to need to speak out more let me to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.140" end="00:04:29.760" style="s2">what they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.430" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">silence killing men which we like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.760" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">part that&#39;s true that there&#39;s some real</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:35.910" style="s2">truth in that we run men&#39;s retreats</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">where we provide spaces for men to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.910" end="00:04:39.270" style="s2">emotionally honest and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:40.860" style="s2">transformative like being an immense</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.270" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">group speaking with your friends about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.860" end="00:04:45.479" style="s2">what&#39;s going on they&#39;re all valuable</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:47.220" style="s2">skills that that we as men need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.479" end="00:04:50.520" style="s2">but then on the flip side of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.220" end="00:04:53.010" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of narrative of when</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.520" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">men men on mass spoke out said we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:58.620" style="s2">like this to your left add it demeans us</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.340" end="00:04:59.850" style="s2">it&#39;s hectoring we don&#39;t need to be told</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.620" end="00:05:02.669" style="s2">how to behave by a massive corporation</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.850" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">all of these responses what you saw from</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.669" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">progressive suppose had progressive</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">people is male fragility our look at you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:13.490" style="s2">get over yourselves men being shut down</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:16.069" style="s2">so this is the catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:17.389" style="s2">in the culture right now is men you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.069" end="00:05:18.949" style="s2">to be open you need to share yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.389" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">more and then when you do you&#39;re jumped</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.949" end="00:05:24.050" style="s2">on and I saw progressive friends who in</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:27.169" style="s2">any other context would not be saying a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:30.110" style="s2">man up don&#39;t complain</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.169" end="00:05:32.870" style="s2">stop being fragile we&#39;re saying exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.110" end="00:05:34.699" style="s2">that and it&#39;s it the performative</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.870" end="00:05:37.130" style="s2">contradiction is what boggles me and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.699" end="00:05:38.599" style="s2">that catch-22 is what we see with a lot</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.500" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">to see did that ad make you let money or</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:26.090" style="s2">because Gillette&#39;s been losing quite a</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.590" end="00:06:34.610" style="s2">certainly what seems very clear is that</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.659" end="00:07:00.590" style="s2">because of the ad they it&#39;s they saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.550" end="00:07:03.409" style="s2">it&#39;s currency fluctuations and it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:12.530" style="s2">for them and then around the same time</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.599" style="s2">we had our first unexpected hit of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.530" end="00:07:16.759" style="s2">year with Heather hi in talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.599" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">toxic femininity and I think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.759" end="00:07:21.469" style="s2">saying that she doesn&#39;t like either term</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:24.620" style="s2">toxic masculinity or toxic femininity</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.469" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">but the idea of it and she wrote a piece</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.620" end="00:07:28.850" style="s2">for Colette earlier on about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:32.690" style="s2">that if there&#39;s a lot of talk in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.850" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">media about one and I think it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.690" end="00:07:36.320" style="s2">saying that Heather doesn&#39;t like either</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.430" end="00:07:39.560" style="s2">turn toxic masculinity or toxic</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.320" end="00:07:41.240" style="s2">femininity but if there is a lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.560" end="00:07:44.330" style="s2">in the media about toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">what is that about and what might be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.330" end="00:07:48.919" style="s2">other side of that conversation I hate</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:50.389" style="s2">both phrases toxic masculinity and toxic</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.919" end="00:07:53.030" style="s2">femininity and you know the piece that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.389" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">wrote for Colette I think was called on</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.030" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">toxic femininity to to make the point</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">right up front you know before I got</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:03.410" style="s2">into it and the piece that this that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">this was going to be that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.410" end="00:08:05.810" style="s2">or at least a very small part of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:09.979" style="s2">actually there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.810" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">more to say about it which is that men</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.979" end="00:08:15.979" style="s2">can go violent few of them do but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:18.289" style="s2">bad women are much less likely to go</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.979" end="00:08:20.419" style="s2">physically violent or on average smaller</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.289" end="00:08:23.210" style="s2">and not as strong of course we&#39;re Dyess</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.419" end="00:08:26.449" style="s2">likely to have used physical violence as</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.210" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">our weapon right men are more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.449" end="00:08:29.960" style="s2">have used physical violence as their</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:33.589" style="s2">weapon when they went violent women are</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.960" end="00:08:36.709" style="s2">much more likely to use wiles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.589" end="00:08:40.270" style="s2">sexuality because especially for young</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.709" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">women that is where their power is and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.270" end="00:08:47.060" style="s2">young women have such vast power over</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:49.580" style="s2">basically every other demographic at</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.060" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">least in American culture in in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.580" end="00:08:53.240" style="s2">cultures you know in the Far East where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:56.029" style="s2">elders are respected more this is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:08:58.339" style="s2">this is not going to be the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.029" end="00:09:00.890" style="s2">dynamic so at the end of January we</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.339" end="00:09:03.740" style="s2">released glitch in the matrix to so</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.890" end="00:09:05.450" style="s2">glitch in the matrix one was pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.740" end="00:09:07.010" style="s2">the one of one of the first films that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.450" end="00:09:09.950" style="s2">we released on the channel bleach and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.010" end="00:09:11.990" style="s2">the matrix 2 was the origins of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.950" end="00:09:14.720" style="s2">intellectual dark web so an extended</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.990" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">interview with Eric Weinstein about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.720" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">mostly his philosophy and how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:21.740" style="s2">intellectual dark web was the the fruit</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:24.140" style="s2">of a lot of patterns he&#39;s been tracking</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">since the 1980s and he talks about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.140" end="00:09:28.520" style="s2">of really useful concepts in there like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.860" style="s2">kayfabe the gated institutional</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.520" end="00:09:33.589" style="s2">narrative and I think it&#39;s a really I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.860" end="00:09:34.910" style="s2">was really impressed with with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.589" end="00:09:36.050" style="s2">tried to kind of turn it into an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.910" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">interesting documentary with a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.050" end="00:09:40.670" style="s2">graphics and a bit sort of shifting it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:45.560" style="s2">around to make the context</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.670" end="00:09:47.960" style="s2">clear part of me wants to work quietly</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.560" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">and part of me realizes that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.960" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">work in some public facing capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:59.240" style="s2">I personally have found it much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">comfortable to have the private life to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.240" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">not have everything that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:08.300" style="s2">broadcast to a large audience but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:09.740" style="s2">think we&#39;ve run out of time and so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.300" end="00:10:13.820" style="s2">think some of us are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.740" end="00:10:16.220" style="s2">reluctantly choosing to make a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.820" end="00:10:17.830" style="s2">call now I think that with the current</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:21.950" style="s2">administration and the White House</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.830" end="00:10:23.960" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing a real discontinuity with</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.950" end="00:10:26.330" style="s2">the past and it wasn&#39;t the discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.960" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">that I was hoping for we had to break</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.330" end="00:10:29.720" style="s2">with the past and I think that the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.280" end="00:10:32.810" style="s2">in which we are now breaking with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">past is so destructive nobody knows what</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.810" end="00:10:38.270" style="s2">to believe nobody quite knows what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:40.460" style="s2">true nobody knows where to turn this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.270" end="00:10:42.320" style="s2">not a tenable situation and so either</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.460" end="00:10:45.530" style="s2">we&#39;re going to descend into some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.320" end="00:10:47.690" style="s2">permanent chaos or there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.530" end="00:10:50.030" style="s2">have to be something that we reboot from</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.690" end="00:10:52.190" style="s2">and that thing cannot be simply left or</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.030" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">simply right and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.190" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">reasons the IDW is hopeful to me why the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.070" end="00:10:59.390" style="s2">IDW has been interesting to us since the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">beginning is this in it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.390" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">initially and if you&#39;re interested I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:06.820" style="s2">a talk recently at university in America</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:09.140" style="s2">about the IDW called</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.820" end="00:11:11.150" style="s2">my journey with the IDW where I went</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.140" end="00:11:13.300" style="s2">into a little bit more but this sense at</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.150" end="00:11:15.500" style="s2">the beginning of an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.300" end="00:11:18.020" style="s2">conversation it was sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.500" end="00:11:19.940" style="s2">intellectual dark web was the naming of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.020" end="00:11:20.780" style="s2">I mean a little bit of background if</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.940" end="00:11:24.380" style="s2">you&#39;re not aware of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.780" end="00:11:28.250" style="s2">dialogue at all it&#39;s the unofficial name</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.220" end="00:11:39.860" style="s2">Peterson and it&#39;s a very and it named a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.420" end="00:11:42.110" style="s2">kind of emergent phenomenon the name</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.860" end="00:11:44.030" style="s2">stuck so the name obviously there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.110" end="00:11:47.270" style="s2">something behind that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.030" end="00:11:48.770" style="s2">named and we&#39;ve kind of digressed quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.270" end="00:11:50.780" style="s2">a lot about what that particular thing</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.780" end="00:11:55.850" style="s2">emergent phenomenon but but the next</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.110" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">surely at least there was this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.850" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">conversations that were alive and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.370" style="s2">potentially going somewhere new and</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:12:03.500" style="s2">often resolving some of the really big</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.370" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">issues and/or potentially resolving some</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:08.750" style="s2">of the bigger issues in society and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:10.310" style="s2">culture and I know that both Brett and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.750" end="00:12:12.140" style="s2">Eric for example see it as a much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.310" end="00:12:14.540" style="s2">project than just the media and the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.140" end="00:12:16.190" style="s2">is the media facing arm of a wider</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:17.959" style="s2">conversation that needs to be had in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.190" end="00:12:20.269" style="s2">many different fields that have all</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.959" end="00:12:22.700" style="s2">become stuck at the same time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.269" end="00:12:26.209" style="s2">still that&#39;s still an important project</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.700" end="00:12:27.890" style="s2">whether the the center of gravity is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.209" end="00:12:29.660" style="s2">still around the intellectual dark where</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.890" end="00:12:33.170" style="s2">that particular constellation is an open</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.660" end="00:12:35.180" style="s2">question and it&#39;s one that yeah I go</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.170" end="00:12:36.920" style="s2">into a little bit in that talk and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.180" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">brings us really nicely into the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.920" end="00:12:39.620" style="s2">big film that were going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:41.630" style="s2">and that was the interview with Ken</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.620" end="00:12:43.070" style="s2">Wilber so Ken Wilber actually got in</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.630" end="00:12:45.470" style="s2">touch with us after reading an article</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.070" end="00:12:47.510" style="s2">that we wrote together about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.470" end="00:12:49.490" style="s2">intellectual dark web where we called</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.490" end="00:12:54.800" style="s2">an emergent integral conversation or</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">terminology that&#39;s one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.990" end="00:13:00.500" style="s2">with it is that it gets lost in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.930" style="s2">terminology along the time the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.500" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">an integral at least of the spiral</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.350" end="00:13:13.970" style="s2">represents this development as a spiral</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.660" end="00:13:18.279" style="s2">in this film will mostly be talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.970" end="00:13:20.870" style="s2">about amber tribalism ethnocentric</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:04.579" style="s2">between these worldviews is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.690" end="00:14:06.540" style="s2">causing many of the worst excesses of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.579" end="00:14:09.100" style="s2">the culture wars</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.540" end="00:14:11.670" style="s2">above these levels Wilbur says is</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.100" end="00:14:15.220" style="s2">another level called integral or</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:17.080" style="s2">second-tier from this perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.220" end="00:14:19.450" style="s2">clear that each of the previous ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.080" end="00:14:21.640" style="s2">seeing the world has value and needs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.450" end="00:14:24.630" style="s2">be integrated what we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.640" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">right now and one of the reasons I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.630" end="00:14:33.130" style="s2">that the intellectual dark web has</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2">particularly arisen at this time is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.130" end="00:14:40.630" style="s2">we really did have the emergence of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:46.149" style="s2">new stage of development and it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.630" end="00:14:48.850" style="s2">is radically relativistic radically</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.149" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">egalitarian prison great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.850" end="00:14:56.140" style="s2">emphasis on equal outcome and she&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:59.980" style="s2">differences at all as the product of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.140" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">oppression or discrimination and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.980" end="00:15:05.950" style="s2">where so many of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:08.380" style="s2">web people are fighting against the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.950" end="00:15:11.920" style="s2">look it&#39;s it&#39;s possible that some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.380" end="00:15:14.770" style="s2">that is oppression no doubt but there</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.920" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">are so other reasons that we see these</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.770" end="00:15:19.180" style="s2">differences and they might have to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:23.589" style="s2">with different interests in male and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.180" end="00:15:29.079" style="s2">female for example nobody is holding</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.589" end="00:15:30.250" style="s2">that as a absolutist ik view but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.079" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">view that they&#39;re not going to rule out</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.250" end="00:15:40.089" style="s2">and you start to see this in a enormous</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:43.570" style="s2">number of important areas in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.089" end="00:15:45.610" style="s2">just how man on average and women on</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.570" end="00:15:47.470" style="s2">average have different types of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.610" end="00:15:49.449" style="s2">interests in just what they find</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.470" end="00:15:51.910" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s no evidence they</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.449" end="00:15:52.300" style="s2">have different capacities it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.910" end="00:15:54.100" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.300" end="00:15:56.170" style="s2">cognitively smarter than women or</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:15:57.730" style="s2">anything like that it&#39;s just they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.170" end="00:15:59.770" style="s2">different things that they consider</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.730" end="00:16:03.850" style="s2">important in life and they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.770" end="00:16:07.029" style="s2">pursue those and part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.850" end="00:16:10.180" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been answered well with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.029" end="00:16:12.760" style="s2">green far-left</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.180" end="00:16:15.640" style="s2">feminists is ok which is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.760" end="00:16:17.380" style="s2">handle that and so naming the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.640" end="00:16:18.889" style="s2">intellectual dark web as an integral</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.380" end="00:16:21.049" style="s2">phenomenon also</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.889" end="00:16:22.879" style="s2">kind of I hope started to bring ken</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.049" end="00:16:25.429" style="s2">wilber an integral into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.879" end="00:16:27.049" style="s2">because I think the IDW the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.429" end="00:16:29.209" style="s2">dart web desperately needs that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.049" end="00:16:30.949" style="s2">perspective because what can happen too</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.209" end="00:16:35.419" style="s2">often with the IDW is that it can slip</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.949" end="00:16:38.389" style="s2">into a low resolution narrative and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.419" end="00:16:41.480" style="s2">initially constellated around a response</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.389" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">to the excesses of post-modernism which</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.480" end="00:16:45.559" style="s2">is a really useful thing a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:48.139" style="s2">thing but it has to move beyond there</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.559" end="00:16:49.699" style="s2">and too often I think we see some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.139" end="00:16:51.309" style="s2">key figures in the intellectual dart web</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.699" end="00:16:54.589" style="s2">just falling back into that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.309" end="00:16:56.779" style="s2">oppositional space rather than looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.589" end="00:16:58.040" style="s2">at what is the potential synthesis on</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.779" end="00:16:59.779" style="s2">the other side of the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.040" end="00:17:01.249" style="s2">dynamic yeah I think it&#39;s worth noting</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.779" end="00:17:02.839" style="s2">as well I mean it integrals been a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.249" end="00:17:04.459" style="s2">useful map and when we use on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.839" end="00:17:06.230" style="s2">channel it&#39;s not the only map we use but</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.459" end="00:17:07.970" style="s2">it is it&#39;s very useful for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.230" end="00:17:10.459" style="s2">I think what&#39;s at play in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.970" end="00:17:12.980" style="s2">and in fact a book Ken Wilber wrote</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.459" end="00:17:14.299" style="s2">called Trump in the post truth world was</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.980" end="00:17:15.980" style="s2">one of the things that really started</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.299" end="00:17:18.169" style="s2">spurring our thoughts very early on it</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.980" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">revel wisdom around okay why are we</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.169" end="00:17:23.179" style="s2">seeing these major shifts in culture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:25.189" style="s2">why are we seeing these these tribal</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.179" end="00:17:28.069" style="s2">dynamics playing out in a very big way</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.189" end="00:17:30.500" style="s2">so it&#39;s hugely useful as that model and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.069" end="00:17:33.049" style="s2">then to the point you made before as</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.500" end="00:17:34.669" style="s2">well part of integral is a yes and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.049" end="00:17:36.409" style="s2">each stage as we develop and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.669" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">lots of developmental models you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.409" end="00:17:39.740" style="s2">Robert Keegan has one and there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">different at play and they&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.740" end="00:17:43.940" style="s2">useful to see how adults develop how we</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:45.230" style="s2">develop as adults rather than just as</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.940" end="00:17:47.539" style="s2">children and how we continue to change</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.230" end="00:17:49.669" style="s2">and grow part of that is saying yes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.539" end="00:17:51.260" style="s2">to each stage so when you&#39;re eight years</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.669" end="00:17:53.929" style="s2">old you don&#39;t reject everything you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.260" end="00:17:55.669" style="s2">when you were five it&#39;s it&#39;s part of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.929" end="00:17:57.590" style="s2">and you then transcend it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.669" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">transcend and include and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.590" end="00:18:02.779" style="s2">been a process I think for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:05.659" style="s2">this year is starting with real allergy</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.779" end="00:18:07.730" style="s2">to green and postmodern values and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.659" end="00:18:09.500" style="s2">real kind of rejection to more of a yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.730" end="00:18:10.789" style="s2">n and going yeah I don&#39;t like the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.500" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">it&#39;s playing out in the culture for sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.789" end="00:18:15.260" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very damaging however not</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:17.090" style="s2">throwing the baby out with the bathwater</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.260" end="00:18:19.279" style="s2">and looking at what does need to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.090" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">taken from that and then moved to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.279" end="00:18:25.669" style="s2">another more nuanced and more inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.010" end="00:18:26.809" style="s2">and wide-ranging stage moving on perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.669" end="00:18:29.299" style="s2">to the next piece we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.809" end="00:18:31.460" style="s2">about which is Jaime Weil who was part</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.299" end="00:18:31.910" style="s2">of integral the integral Institute for</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.460" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:36.590" style="s2">and as a deep familiarity was actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">teaching the integral map in business</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.590" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">for quite a long time he had a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:43.580" style="s2">line in that piece about that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">integral map is a is a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.580" end="00:18:48.590" style="s2">operating system and that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:49.850" style="s2">people who he calls breaking trail so</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.590" end="00:18:52.910" style="s2">that the sort of the people who are sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.850" end="00:18:55.040" style="s2">of at the cutting edge of the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.910" end="00:18:57.080" style="s2">cultural conversation have that integral</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.040" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">map and I think that&#39;s a beautiful way</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.080" end="00:19:00.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve used that several times since that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">the integral OS operating system is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.980" end="00:19:06.310" style="s2">really really useful the danger and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:10.100" style="s2">Jamie goes into this in the in the piece</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.310" end="00:19:11.990" style="s2">is that you mistake the map for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.100" end="00:19:13.670" style="s2">territory just kind of ironic because in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.990" end="00:19:15.530" style="s2">an integral they they say you definitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.670" end="00:19:17.950" style="s2">need to avoid mistake in the map for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.530" end="00:19:19.940" style="s2">territory but you see that so often</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.950" end="00:19:22.760" style="s2">partly because it&#39;s a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.940" end="00:19:24.950" style="s2">and useful map because suddenly if</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.760" end="00:19:29.870" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to talk about green</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.950" end="00:19:32.390" style="s2">orange red and all of this very useful</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.870" end="00:19:34.130" style="s2">terminology you can very easily just</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.390" end="00:19:37.160" style="s2">start becoming very very insular and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.130" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">just becomes this conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.160" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">just inside baseball almost inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">and you see that so much about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:47.150" style="s2">integral communities is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:49.940" style="s2">sense of turning in on itself and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.150" end="00:19:52.280" style="s2">that&#39;s really unfortunate it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.940" end="00:19:54.920" style="s2">the case as we move into these you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.280" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">nominally transpersonal communities is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.920" end="00:19:59.090" style="s2">that all of these thought leaders who</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">have been breaking trail right there but</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.090" end="00:20:02.030" style="s2">they brought they brought through</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:04.070" style="s2">something profound something unique</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.030" end="00:20:07.820" style="s2">something useful they&#39;re bringing a tool</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.070" end="00:20:10.970" style="s2">to our shared collective and by default</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.820" end="00:20:13.970" style="s2">and or by design we&#39;re all wounded</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.970" end="00:20:16.580" style="s2">healers we all need the thing that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.970" end="00:20:19.430" style="s2">built more than anybody else needs it</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.580" end="00:20:22.130" style="s2">and I think that that same case is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.430" end="00:20:25.460" style="s2">probably true for Ken and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.130" end="00:20:27.530" style="s2">having the people who have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.460" end="00:20:31.310" style="s2">and benefited from integral theory then</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.530" end="00:20:35.900" style="s2">rise up in some sort of unreconciled</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.310" end="00:20:39.100" style="s2">slay the father angry child dynamic can</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.900" end="00:20:42.500" style="s2">there be instead the sense of hey why</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.100" end="00:20:45.470" style="s2">your life&#39;s work has lit things up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.500" end="00:20:47.690" style="s2">me has helped guide my path Wright has</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.470" end="00:20:50.330" style="s2">brought me to places I never had</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.690" end="00:20:53.150" style="s2">imagined and perhaps can we then turn</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">around and give back the wounded healer</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.150" end="00:20:59.900" style="s2">the realized gift that they offered in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:21:01.550" style="s2">the first place and not needs to not no</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.900" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">need to knock them down off pedestals</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.550" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">and no need to kind of reclaim our gold</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:09.230" style="s2">and kind of Angry and dysfunctional ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:12.380" style="s2">but to say thank you so much and let us</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.230" end="00:21:14.960" style="s2">return the favor let us return academic</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.380" end="00:21:17.410" style="s2">acknowledgement let us return community</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.960" end="00:21:21.440" style="s2">let us return love appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.410" end="00:21:23.540" style="s2">affection and challenge let us show up</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.440" end="00:21:26.810" style="s2">as the humans you&#39;ve been writing about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.540" end="00:21:28.640" style="s2">all along and let&#39;s help you take that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.810" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">final step for yourself we don&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.640" end="00:21:33.260" style="s2">need all of our teachers to be Moses</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:35.300" style="s2">leading people to the promised land and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.260" end="00:21:37.550" style="s2">getting stuck on the edge we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.300" end="00:21:41.180" style="s2">actually welcome the folks that help</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.550" end="00:21:43.640" style="s2">guide us to that land - to the potty</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.180" end="00:21:45.080" style="s2">itself just add to that another danger I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.640" end="00:21:46.970" style="s2">think of confusing a map when the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:50.660" style="s2">territory is that even if the map says</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.970" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">as integral often does practice is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:53.570" style="s2">important embodying the audience in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:54.770" style="s2">life is important you have to make the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.570" end="00:21:59.270" style="s2">time to meditate you have to make the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.770" end="00:22:01.400" style="s2">time to do whatever else people can even</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.270" end="00:22:02.540" style="s2">avoid that and not do the practice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.400" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">so that&#39;s something I&#39;ve heard a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.540" end="00:22:07.610" style="s2">people mention about not just integral</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">but lots of different let&#39;s say models</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.610" end="00:22:11.630" style="s2">of reality you know is that people take</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:13.670" style="s2">the model in place of actually having to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.630" end="00:22:15.470" style="s2">do the hard work of bringing it into</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.670" end="00:22:17.210" style="s2">your life challenging yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.470" end="00:22:18.740" style="s2">that&#39;s quite close to my heart because</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.210" end="00:22:21.710" style="s2">we talk a lot on the channel about what</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.740" end="00:22:23.210" style="s2">are the practices we need to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.710" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2">to start living these ideas out in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.210" end="00:22:26.870" style="s2">lives and having an imp have an impact</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.100" end="00:22:28.790" style="s2">on ourselves and our communities and on</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.870" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">that note I wanted to introduce the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.790" end="00:22:32.540" style="s2">person we&#39;re going to talk about who is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">John Verve a key so John Verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.540" end="00:22:37.130" style="s2">sort of hit the scene I suppose last</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2">year he&#39;s a cognitive scientist at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.130" end="00:22:42.140" style="s2">University of Toronto and he released a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:44.620" style="s2">youtube series called awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.140" end="00:22:47.300" style="s2">meaning crisis and that is quite a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.620" end="00:22:50.420" style="s2">hugely impressive series where he begins</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.300" end="00:22:52.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t say prehistory and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.420" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">shamanism and looking at flow States and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.250" end="00:22:55.460" style="s2">goes all the way through the history of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:56.370" style="s2">Western philosophy from a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.460" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">science angle to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.370" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">cat why is there a crisis and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.590" style="s2">the culture what do we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.780" style="s2">about what he would describe is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.590" end="00:23:05.910" style="s2">grammar of our thought and where do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.780" end="00:23:07.260" style="s2">psycho technologies as he refers them so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.910" end="00:23:09.780" style="s2">the practices I was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.260" end="00:23:11.820" style="s2">where do those fit into the mix and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.780" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">where do they come from why do we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.820" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">them in the first place and so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:20.580" style="s2">created a really brilliant narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:22.620" style="s2">understanding of why are we where we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.580" end="00:23:24.000" style="s2">which is obviously one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.620" end="00:23:26.180" style="s2">questions we have a tribal wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.000" end="00:23:28.860" style="s2">what are the underlying dynamics between</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.180" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">behind the crisis and meaning and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.860" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">crucially what can we do about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">and I think for me one of the real tests</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">of someone&#39;s thought is how often I find</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:39.990" style="s2">myself using their terms or their</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:41.490" style="s2">language when trying to explain things</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.990" end="00:23:43.830" style="s2">like how useful of their conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.490" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">frameworks and John definitely I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.830" end="00:23:48.750" style="s2">all of us would would say that we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.700" style="s2">used a lot of his language a lot the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.750" end="00:23:52.410" style="s2">idea of psycho technologies for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.700" end="00:23:53.730" style="s2">is a really useful concept when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.410" end="00:23:56.520" style="s2">talking about kind of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.730" end="00:23:59.670" style="s2">mimetic evolution for example I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.520" end="00:24:02.280" style="s2">to salvage what I can from these axial</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.670" end="00:24:03.660" style="s2">age wisdom traditions these systematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.280" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">sets of psycho technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.660" end="00:24:08.790" style="s2">transforming you know consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:11.490" style="s2">cognition character and community like</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.790" end="00:24:14.550" style="s2">those are powerful we have to salvage</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.490" end="00:24:17.460" style="s2">those and my reason for saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.550" end="00:24:20.580" style="s2">because they they they were born from in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:23.880" style="s2">our meshed in the axial revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.580" end="00:24:26.790" style="s2">it&#39;s in its two world mythology and all</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.880" end="00:24:28.260" style="s2">kinds of ways of trying to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.790" end="00:24:30.990" style="s2">grammar for thinking about self</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.260" end="00:24:33.150" style="s2">transcendence that do not mesh well do</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.990" end="00:24:36.059" style="s2">not fit well with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.150" end="00:24:37.530" style="s2">worldview so try and not get the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.059" end="00:24:40.530" style="s2">connotations from this word but I am</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.530" end="00:24:42.809" style="s2">trying to salvage from those wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.010" end="00:25:07.260" style="s2">further something we did later on we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.100" end="00:25:11.070" style="s2">have a conversation with Jordan green</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.260" end="00:25:12.929" style="s2">hall and they talked about a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.070" end="00:25:15.420" style="s2">technology the solution that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.929" end="00:25:17.850" style="s2">developed as humans boost by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.420" end="00:25:19.860" style="s2">in fact why we are where we are right II</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.850" end="00:25:23.280" style="s2">goddess the psycho technology the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.860" end="00:25:25.260" style="s2">invention of psycho technology is a the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.280" end="00:25:26.970" style="s2">gift that keeps on giving and it moves</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.260" end="00:25:28.470" style="s2">us further and further away from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.970" end="00:25:30.900" style="s2">context that gave rise to it in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.470" end="00:25:33.330" style="s2">first place second technology puts us on</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.900" end="00:25:34.980" style="s2">a very different Fitness landscape very</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.330" end="00:25:38.280" style="s2">dose instead of characteristic dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.980" end="00:25:40.380" style="s2">and so we have to actually formulate the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.280" end="00:25:42.390" style="s2">psycho tech the meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.380" end="00:25:44.220" style="s2">of engaging in the design of psycho</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.260" end="00:25:51.210" style="s2">ourselves in and that is a very good way</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.270" end="00:25:54.060" style="s2">for them oh I really liked that that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.210" end="00:25:56.040" style="s2">really that really saying to me the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.060" end="00:25:58.410" style="s2">ladies put that I really liked about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.040" end="00:26:00.840" style="s2">lot I really resonated with me that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.410" end="00:26:02.429" style="s2">very clear that was those very</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.840" end="00:26:09.890" style="s2">insightful that drew it all together</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.429" end="00:26:12.900" style="s2">very nicely so it is is that oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.890" end="00:26:14.700" style="s2">that that&#39;s very interesting a very cool</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.900" end="00:26:17.910" style="s2">putting how would you summarize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.700" end="00:26:20.670" style="s2">John was that that we need to we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.910" end="00:26:22.679" style="s2">mindfully or create our own psycho</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.670" end="00:26:25.290" style="s2">technologies to get through that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.679" end="00:26:26.910" style="s2">that the key well but the key piece I</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.290" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">got out of that is we need to step back</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.910" end="00:26:33.090" style="s2">and create a meta psycho technology for</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:35.160" style="s2">evaluating how we&#39;re designing our our</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.090" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">our psycho technologies and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.160" end="00:26:39.510" style="s2">analogous to in problem solving how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">have to you have to step back and have</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:48.090" style="s2">creating and selecting the heuristics</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.500" end="00:26:56.340" style="s2">yet I kind of get it but I know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.360" end="00:26:59.070" style="s2">that particular conversation that kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.340" end="00:27:01.650" style="s2">of moment of emergence in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.070" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">conversation between Jordan and and John</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.650" end="00:27:07.020" style="s2">was a real sense of are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.540" style="s2">something there and I know that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.020" end="00:27:13.140" style="s2">kind of revelation has really informed</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.540" end="00:27:14.690" style="s2">John bhave keys work since and he is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.140" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">putting together a new series called</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.690" end="00:27:19.530" style="s2">after Socrates about the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:20.540" style="s2">dialectic about the evolution of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.530" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.540" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">of truth as a practice which he says</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.900" style="s2">that was intrinsic to the the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:28.220" style="s2">Greeks they had they had that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.900" end="00:27:29.960" style="s2">their culture it wasn&#39;t just the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.220" end="00:27:31.850" style="s2">it was the the process of coming to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.960" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">truth and that is something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.850" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">lost because we now think of ideas just</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:37.670" style="s2">as propositional nodders and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:39.770" style="s2">interrelatedness between us and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.670" end="00:27:41.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a film coming out</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.770" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">maybe before this maybe slightly after</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.720" end="00:27:45.140" style="s2">us but certainly over the Christmas</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:47.390" style="s2">period where I interview him about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.140" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">and he talks about the the new series</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.390" end="00:27:50.810" style="s2">that he&#39;s got coming up after Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">which he should definitely check out</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:56.780" style="s2">then we had a whole series of films with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:59.270" style="s2">the evolutionary psychologists Diana</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.780" end="00:28:01.610" style="s2">Fleischman and Jeffrey Miller including</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.270" end="00:28:04.940" style="s2">one about their relationship about</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.610" end="00:28:07.070" style="s2">polyamory and as Jeffrey predicted there</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.940" end="00:28:09.320" style="s2">was a lot of response in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.070" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">you know it was said by a lot of folks</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.320" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">in the hall right politics is downstream</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">of culture but culture also apparently</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:17.240" style="s2">is down the stream of the mating system</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:20.120" style="s2">so if you really want to get people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.240" end="00:28:22.520" style="s2">riled up you challenge the mating system</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.120" end="00:28:24.380" style="s2">that actually dominates you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.520" end="00:28:27.470" style="s2">relations between the sexes but also</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.380" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">family structure and has knock-on</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.470" end="00:28:33.170" style="s2">effects on everything from kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:37.310" style="s2">design of housing and urban spaces to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.170" end="00:28:39.740" style="s2">the design of careers and the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.310" end="00:28:42.650" style="s2">which people can kind of use freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.740" end="00:28:45.980" style="s2">association to form little families or</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.650" end="00:28:48.500" style="s2">poly tools or communes or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.980" end="00:28:52.670" style="s2">as soon as you kind of shake the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.500" end="00:28:56.210" style="s2">monogamy and challenge that people panic</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.670" end="00:28:58.580" style="s2">and they think like what else might have</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.210" end="00:28:59.780" style="s2">to change if this is ever questioned we</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.580" end="00:29:01.900" style="s2">actually don&#39;t really pay that much</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.780" end="00:29:04.100" style="s2">attention to other polyamorous people</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.900" end="00:29:05.960" style="s2">because we think that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.100" end="00:29:10.460" style="s2">other polyamorous people endorse is</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.960" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">actively not to be yeah unless we put</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.460" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">too fine a point on it but yeah we I</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.950" end="00:29:17.660" style="s2">mean I always like to say that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">endorse it we just talk about how it can</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.660" end="00:29:24.770" style="s2">work for some people and about how it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">potentially you know the better way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.770" end="00:29:30.830" style="s2">have a fuller life for people who can</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">manage jealousy and who you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.830" end="00:29:33.010" style="s2">I actually don&#39;t understand how people</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:34.540" style="s2">do polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.010" end="00:29:36.250" style="s2">without an evolutionary perspective for</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.540" end="00:29:38.470" style="s2">example and that is something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.250" end="00:29:41.680" style="s2">planning on exploring more and writing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.470" end="00:29:44.890" style="s2">and videos yeah now we come to May and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.680" end="00:29:47.530" style="s2">the interview with Dave Rubin and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.890" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">been kind of potentially wanting to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.530" end="00:29:52.210" style="s2">an interview with him for a while he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:53.830" style="s2">hugely important in the kind of as he as</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.210" end="00:29:55.300" style="s2">he describes the connective tissue of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.830" end="00:29:57.310" style="s2">the intellectual dark web in the early</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.300" end="00:29:59.350" style="s2">stages and I think if that interview had</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.310" end="00:30:02.160" style="s2">happened a year before it would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.350" end="00:30:05.290" style="s2">been a very different kind of interview</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.160" end="00:30:07.480" style="s2">but in the run-up to it I I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.290" end="00:30:11.950" style="s2">researching reading and looking at a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.480" end="00:30:13.540" style="s2">of stuff and I I felt there were some as</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.950" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">a journalist I felt that there were some</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.540" end="00:30:18.070" style="s2">questions that I had to ask him about</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:21.220" style="s2">his interview technique about the way he</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.070" end="00:30:23.890" style="s2">frames as interviews that I felt were</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.220" end="00:30:26.500" style="s2">really important to ask I felt I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.890" end="00:30:27.790" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been able to kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.500" end="00:30:28.810" style="s2">at myself in the mirror if I hadn&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.790" end="00:30:30.190" style="s2">that opportunity which was similar with</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.810" end="00:30:31.630" style="s2">with Ken Wilber to be honest there were</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.190" end="00:30:33.820" style="s2">a couple of questions I asked at the end</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.630" end="00:30:35.230" style="s2">- Ken Wilber about the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.820" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">integral and his relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.230" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">Andrew Cohen that I also felt needed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">be addressed if I&#39;m going to have an</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:42.790" style="s2">interview with Kem Wenger I need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.100" style="s2">address those and it&#39;s not I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.790" end="00:30:47.530" style="s2">enjoy that part of the job so much I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.100" end="00:30:49.330" style="s2">don&#39;t enjoy the sort of combative</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.530" end="00:30:50.560" style="s2">interviews and there&#39;s also a danger of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.330" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">being accused of sort of gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.560" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">journalism and all of those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:58.030" style="s2">things which I think we&#39;re rightly tired</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:31:00.760" style="s2">of in all of the mainstream media but</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.030" end="00:31:03.940" style="s2">also as a journalist you have an</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">that the sort of the moral rules that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.400" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve kind of internalized that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:11.530" style="s2">effectively you&#39;re in the place of many</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:13.330" style="s2">other people who might want to have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.530" end="00:31:15.040" style="s2">conversation so all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.330" end="00:31:16.210" style="s2">conversation the discussions that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.040" end="00:31:18.040" style="s2">out there are the questions that are out</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.210" end="00:31:20.560" style="s2">there that you think have valid</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.040" end="00:31:22.120" style="s2">questions you have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.560" end="00:31:23.620" style="s2">obligation to put them to that person</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.120" end="00:31:25.390" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of controversy around</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.620" end="00:31:28.300" style="s2">Dave Rubin some of which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.390" end="00:31:30.040" style="s2">unfair some which I think is fair and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.300" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">I put those questions to him yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.040" end="00:31:34.090" style="s2">guess if there&#39;s a physical center of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.850" style="s2">the intellectual dark web it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.090" end="00:31:38.440" style="s2">here I mean it&#39;s in my garage so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.850" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">not like you get you sit down with</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.440" end="00:31:43.300" style="s2">someone and automatically you strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.770" style="s2">them there&#39;s no automatic maybe they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.300" end="00:31:46.390" style="s2">be strengthened if their ideas are good</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.770" end="00:31:47.620" style="s2">and man</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.390" end="00:31:48.760" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever argue that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.620" end="00:31:50.890" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t sit down with someone I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.760" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">my main point is whether people are</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.890" end="00:31:56.470" style="s2">being challenged enough because and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.490" end="00:32:00.220" style="s2">goes back to my point before about has</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.470" end="00:32:01.750" style="s2">has it shifted because because now there</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.220" end="00:32:03.040" style="s2">are expectations I mean we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.750" end="00:32:04.570" style="s2">that for Joe Rogan I think we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.040" end="00:32:06.220" style="s2">this with you as well that there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.570" end="00:32:07.960" style="s2">expectations that you will hold people</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.220" end="00:32:09.820" style="s2">to account in a way that when you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.960" end="00:32:12.070" style="s2">upstart kind of alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.820" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">chatter yes we&#39;re not there right so as</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.070" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">I said earlier they look the bigger you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:17.080" style="s2">get the more relevant you get the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:18.610" style="s2">haters are gonna come out but the more</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.080" end="00:32:20.710" style="s2">that legitimate criticism will come out</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.610" end="00:32:21.820" style="s2">- and again I address this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.710" end="00:32:27.940" style="s2">what do you think&#39;s the most legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.820" end="00:32:30.160" style="s2">criticism it&#39;s not really for me to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.940" end="00:32:31.750" style="s2">what the legitimate criticism of me if</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.160" end="00:32:33.400" style="s2">someone wants to say that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.750" end="00:32:34.810" style="s2">like the way I interview or that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.400" end="00:32:35.230" style="s2">ask hard enough questions or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.810" end="00:32:37.050" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.230" end="00:32:40.300" style="s2">well I suppose that is a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.050" end="00:32:42.100" style="s2">criticism of me it&#39;s not the way I like</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.300" end="00:32:43.810" style="s2">doing my business and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.100" end="00:32:45.310" style="s2">don&#39;t like what I&#39;m doing then I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.810" end="00:32:47.170" style="s2">say you don&#39;t have to watch doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.310" end="00:32:48.430" style="s2">I&#39;m doing it perfectly I&#39;m doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.170" end="00:32:49.900" style="s2">doing something that I believe is good</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.430" end="00:32:51.970" style="s2">apparently a lot of other people think</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.900" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">it&#39;s good too and and apparently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.970" end="00:32:56.670" style="s2">pretty rare these days and there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:33:02.110" style="s2">some communication with Dave behind on</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.670" end="00:33:05.080" style="s2">afterwards and then I watched it and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.110" end="00:33:06.190" style="s2">watched it back and I and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.080" end="00:33:08.530" style="s2">one of the better interviews that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.190" end="00:33:10.360" style="s2">done I think I explained very clearly at</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.530" end="00:33:13.060" style="s2">the beginning talk about the values of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.360" end="00:33:15.670" style="s2">the IDW intellectual dark web and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.060" end="00:33:18.160" style="s2">and he agreed with most of those values</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.670" end="00:33:19.420" style="s2">and then at the end I put some points to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.160" end="00:33:20.980" style="s2">him that I thought well where he haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.420" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">lived up to those values I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.980" end="00:33:23.790" style="s2">impactful interview I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.950" style="s2">important one I think it&#39;s a fair one</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.790" end="00:33:29.140" style="s2">and also I think it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.950" end="00:33:32.250" style="s2">for us as a channel that we maintain</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.140" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">that integrity and maintain that ability</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.250" end="00:33:37.690" style="s2">to ask the harder questions as well as</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">the the easier questions yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.690" end="00:33:42.100" style="s2">think that also speaks to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:44.230" style="s2">core I suppose values we have which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.100" end="00:33:46.300" style="s2">truth orienting ourselves to truth as</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.230" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">best we can and I think that runs</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.300" end="00:33:51.340" style="s2">through most of what we do or we hope it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:53.290" style="s2">does and so I think one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.340" end="00:33:54.940" style="s2">experiences we had with that this year</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.290" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">was the rebel wisdom summit so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.940" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">been doing smaller evening events where</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:33:59.230" style="s2">we have a speaker and then get people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:00.929" style="s2">into smaller groups to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.230" end="00:34:04.630" style="s2">some of the techniques we used in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.929" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">weekend retreats to you know explore the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.630" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">truth how do I feel about these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:11.409" style="s2">what do I feel I can&#39;t say and just</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:13.540" style="s2">slowly feeling into that so the summit</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.409" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">was an experiment to see could we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.540" end="00:34:17.470" style="s2">that on a bigger scale so we had 150</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:19.750" style="s2">people we had Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.470" end="00:34:23.290" style="s2">Heather huiying Iain McGilchrist and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.750" end="00:34:25.210" style="s2">Jordan Hall and as well as them talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.290" end="00:34:26.859" style="s2">and kind of modeling that on stage we</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.210" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">also broke off into smaller groups so</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.859" end="00:34:31.000" style="s2">that has been a big process of can we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:33.159" style="s2">bring truth into the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.000" end="00:34:35.350" style="s2">conversation because very often I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.159" end="00:34:37.929" style="s2">many of us feel stifled we feel we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.350" end="00:34:40.330" style="s2">know how to really tackle these hugely</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.929" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">complex ideas that are hot topics in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.330" end="00:34:44.859" style="s2">culture whether it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">brexit or immigration or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.859" end="00:34:50.230" style="s2">gender dynamics in the culture there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:52.780" style="s2">so many zones that feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.230" end="00:34:55.060" style="s2">no-go zones their mind their mine feels</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.780" end="00:34:57.160" style="s2">conversational minefields but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.060" end="00:34:59.350" style="s2">very much I think there&#39;s a huge need</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.160" end="00:35:02.290" style="s2">for the tech kind of techniques one</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.350" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">might use in in an you know personal</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.290" end="00:35:05.740" style="s2">growth workshop which is driven by truth</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:07.600" style="s2">so what is the truth of what I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.740" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2">right now and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.600" end="00:35:10.930" style="s2">techniques like circling which we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.250" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">talk about later that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.930" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">at this year as well which really focus</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:17.710" style="s2">on the inter subjective truth and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">been a huge theme so the summit was an</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.710" end="00:35:22.060" style="s2">experiment in that and we learned a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.300" end="00:35:23.590" style="s2">from it and now we&#39;re gonna be expanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.060" end="00:35:25.780" style="s2">that at the rebel ism festival next May</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.590" end="00:35:27.820" style="s2">so about a year later the summit was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.780" end="00:35:29.020" style="s2">really enjoyable event and I think one</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.820" end="00:35:31.900" style="s2">of the big learnings that were taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.020" end="00:35:35.140" style="s2">into the festival is rather than try and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.900" end="00:35:37.330" style="s2">curate a whole event where everyone goes</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.140" end="00:35:39.130" style="s2">through the same experience it&#39;s to give</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:41.350" style="s2">people the option to dive into different</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.130" end="00:35:42.850" style="s2">things and create multiple tracks so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.350" end="00:35:44.920" style="s2">can actually go way deeper if you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.850" end="00:35:47.020" style="s2">to like into a into a circling session</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.920" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">or even a breathwork session or you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.020" end="00:35:52.570" style="s2">go to the the talks and you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:54.520" style="s2">do tasters of other things like having</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.570" end="00:35:56.140" style="s2">that variety of different options or how</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.520" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">choose-your-own-adventure</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.140" end="00:36:00.010" style="s2">I think is something that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:02.590" style="s2">realized will paradoxically allow people</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.010" end="00:36:03.580" style="s2">to create their own experience and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.590" end="00:36:05.500" style="s2">potentially have a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.580" end="00:36:07.180" style="s2">experience and that will benefit</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.500" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">everyone I think so now in June</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.180" end="00:36:12.130" style="s2">something that surprised what a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:12.420" style="s2">people was John Cleese so just a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.130" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">the back</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:18.300" style="s2">story on that really quite fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">because I first saw John Cleese&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.300" end="00:36:22.200" style="s2">on a book by Richard Thomas so rich</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:23.640" style="s2">Thomas has been on the channel before</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:25.740" style="s2">I&#39;m a huge admirer of his work</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.640" end="00:36:28.580" style="s2">especially passion of the Western mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.740" end="00:36:30.780" style="s2">which highly recommend as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.580" end="00:36:32.730" style="s2">grand narrative of where we are in</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.850" end="00:36:55.080" style="s2">and then we also found out that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.300" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">he&#39;s a big fan of Ian&#39;s work so agreed</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.220" style="s2">to do an interview on the channel and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.140" style="s2">had a quite a short period of time just</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.220" end="00:37:15.810" style="s2">to grab him in between sort of sessions</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.140" end="00:37:18.210" style="s2">on the on the course but it was really</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.810" end="00:37:20.010" style="s2">nice to see that different side of his</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.010" end="00:37:25.740" style="s2">in stuff to do with psychology of almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.950" end="00:37:29.870" style="s2">every time and I&#39;m also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.740" end="00:37:35.370" style="s2">spiritual stuff in a very weakened form</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.870" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">which is what I what I call why we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:38:00.900" end="00:38:05.580" style="s2">so August we released the science and</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.500" end="00:38:14.610" style="s2">pleased with that because that had been</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.610" end="00:38:23.130" style="s2">interviewed Stephen Porges a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.810" end="00:38:25.530" style="s2">interviewed Peter Levine in America two</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.130" end="00:38:29.640" style="s2">of the kind of the most interesting</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:39.960" style="s2">together with the sort of cultural piece</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.600" style="s2">and the difficult conversations piece</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.960" end="00:38:44.070" style="s2">felt very right and complete that felt</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.600" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">very cutting edge and still feels very</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.280" end="00:39:06.120" style="s2">was received and also it seemed to sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.810" end="00:39:08.340" style="s2">of reach a new audience of people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.120" end="00:39:10.740" style="s2">were kind of interested and and felt</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.340" end="00:39:12.270" style="s2">like we were zeroing in on okay what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.740" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">really need to be talking about is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.270" end="00:39:15.180" style="s2">do we have these conversations at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:17.010" style="s2">like what are the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.180" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">preventing us having them why are they</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.010" end="00:39:22.920" style="s2">why are they collapsing and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:25.350" style="s2">quite an interim portent dynamic of okay</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.150" end="00:39:37.380" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to feel defensive can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.640" end="00:39:40.020" style="s2">make that leap to feeling curious about</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.780" end="00:40:08.790" style="s2">there&#39;s no way you can really listen to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.270" end="00:40:11.700" style="s2">another person and and express yourself</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:23.250" style="s2">Porges came up with a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.030" end="00:40:27.180" style="s2">theory that links together psychology</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:33.360" style="s2">was called polyvagal and focused on the</p>

<p begin="00:40:33.360" end="00:40:38.420" style="s2">links together all the major organs and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.700" end="00:40:40.790" style="s2">also connects to the face and voice</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.420" end="00:40:42.859" style="s2">for the first time there was a theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.790" end="00:40:44.839" style="s2">that explained how our own body and mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.859" end="00:40:47.089" style="s2">are intimately connected to our facial</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.089" end="00:40:54.230" style="s2">system and therefore to others how the</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.140" end="00:41:04.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not feeling safe then we fall into</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.390" end="00:41:07.220" style="s2">defensiveness we start to see everything</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.549" style="s2">bottom line is I think there are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.750" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">be more and more people having this</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.549" end="00:41:30.710" style="s2">understanding because now you have with</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">polyvagal theory and neurobiology that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.710" end="00:41:34.790" style="s2">supports the philosophy LOF achill and</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:43.940" style="s2">in the same point one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.960" end="00:41:45.559" style="s2">we know that it&#39;s being kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.150" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">as a talk yes we created a talk called</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.640" end="00:41:52.819" style="s2">the neuroscience of difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:55.220" style="s2">conversations and the first one we did</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.819" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">was a wilderness festival and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.220" end="00:41:59.450" style="s2">turnout was way bigger than we expected</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:01.609" style="s2">which was really encouraging and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.450" end="00:42:02.930" style="s2">really seems to be something that feels</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.609" end="00:42:04.549" style="s2">needed in the culture right now is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.930" end="00:42:06.740" style="s2">understand what are the biological</p>

<p begin="00:42:06.740" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">because I think we all have that lived</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.119" end="00:42:11.720" style="s2">experience of falling into defensiveness</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">or feeling that when someone attacks an</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.720" end="00:42:15.170" style="s2">idea we&#39;re being attacked and then it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:16.579" style="s2">just goes downhill whether it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.170" end="00:42:18.290" style="s2">relationship or whether it&#39;s in a</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.290" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">table I think it filled in a missing</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.359" end="00:42:23.630" style="s2">piece and our thinking as well and was</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.690" style="s2">was incredibly valuable to understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.630" end="00:42:28.790" style="s2">polyvagal theory to understand the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.690" end="00:42:30.670" style="s2">the science and psychology of what what</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.790" end="00:42:33.079" style="s2">happens in a conversation and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.670" end="00:42:35.690" style="s2">delivering that talk was really fun as</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.079" end="00:42:37.400" style="s2">well because we also brought in Jonathon</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.400" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re bringing probably the only</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.829" end="00:42:51.050" style="s2">about and then also just having some fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.680" end="00:42:52.670" style="s2">practice around okay where I think we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.050" end="00:42:54.080" style="s2">it started to talk with when&#39;s the last</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">good faith conversation like is it was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.450" end="00:43:15.230" style="s2">big factor of the IDW that&#39;s crucial and</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:31.490" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening yes we had two of</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:34.790" style="s2">in August the second one being a</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.790" end="00:43:38.990" style="s2">neither of the neither of them had like</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.250" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">huge views compared to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.990" end="00:43:43.730" style="s2">things on the channel but in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.730" end="00:43:47.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve been having since and also the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.380" end="00:43:48.920" style="s2">among the members and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.780" end="00:43:50.840" style="s2">conversations we&#39;re having with our</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.920" end="00:43:52.280" style="s2">subscribers and our members we know they</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.840" end="00:43:55.880" style="s2">were really really impactful it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.280" end="00:43:57.950" style="s2">something that was really alive for them</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:43:59.840" style="s2">and really sort of named something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.950" end="00:44:02.300" style="s2">a lot of people were very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.840" end="00:44:04.610" style="s2">and the collective intelligence series</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.300" end="00:44:07.130" style="s2">links very well to the the polarization</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.130" end="00:44:13.880" style="s2">sort of generative dialogue collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.710" end="00:44:17.030" style="s2">intelligence coherence emergence unless</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.030" end="00:44:21.200" style="s2">yourself to be sort of we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.980" end="00:44:23.840" style="s2">about the phrase sovereignty but to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.200" end="00:44:26.210" style="s2">able to to not be sort of hijacked by</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.840" end="00:44:29.300" style="s2">our limbic system hijacked by our kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.210" end="00:44:30.830" style="s2">of reactions to things or just go into a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.300" end="00:44:32.030" style="s2">track of knowing that we&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.830" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">then just delivering some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.030" end="00:44:35.750" style="s2">pre-prepared speech those are all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:38.510" style="s2">things that sort of block genuine</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.750" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">emergent dialogue so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.510" end="00:44:42.130" style="s2">really interesting link between them it</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">also ties back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.130" end="00:44:47.150" style="s2">attraction to the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:49.370" style="s2">of that sense of a conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.150" end="00:44:51.890" style="s2">could go anywhere and it&#39;s not just into</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.370" end="00:44:53.830" style="s2">sort of reactive spaces of a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.890" end="00:44:56.810" style="s2">that we&#39;re already familiar with and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.830" end="00:44:59.180" style="s2">we&#39;d argue that that hasn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.810" end="00:45:01.640" style="s2">been sustained by the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.180" end="00:45:02.900" style="s2">web but we are going to have to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.640" end="00:45:04.230" style="s2">some way of doing that because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.900" end="00:45:06.510" style="s2">going to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.230" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">the cultural cul-de-sacs we&#39;ve created</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.530" end="00:45:13.290" style="s2">includes kind of what are the things</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.290" end="00:45:16.020" style="s2">well the perspectives one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.790" end="00:45:18.570" style="s2">attitudes that are derail in those</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.020" end="00:45:20.010" style="s2">conversations but the what was really</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.570" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">striking about the collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.010" end="00:45:24.780" style="s2">intelligence series is we had a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:28.650" style="s2">beautiful piece in the center of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.780" end="00:45:29.550" style="s2">with three of the the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.650" end="00:45:30.660" style="s2">and impressive thinkers we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.550" end="00:45:33.330" style="s2">interviewed since we started doing the</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.470" end="00:45:48.980" style="s2">sprawling conversation that went from</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:52.410" style="s2">the sort of sublime to the impenetrable</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:07.320" style="s2">storytelling monkeys and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.890" end="00:46:09.000" style="s2">we need recipes to help the thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.320" end="00:46:11.340" style="s2">propagate so this could list everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.000" end="00:46:13.109" style="s2">generators then why does it always break</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.340" end="00:46:14.550" style="s2">down mm-hmm why don&#39;t why every time you</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.109" end="00:46:19.609" style="s2">try to scale to break down one of the</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.840" end="00:46:34.050" style="s2">they fuck it up so let&#39;s be mindful of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.380" end="00:46:36.780" style="s2">that and recognize that the storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.050" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">piece of it definitely isn&#39;t the answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.780" end="00:46:42.570" style="s2">okay so Sherlock Holmes style now carve</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.670" style="s2">that out of the available portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.570" end="00:46:45.840" style="s2">things that we can do how do we go about</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.600" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">if you know where we are culturally</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:01.890" style="s2">these days there&#39;s a lot of people are</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.700" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">coherent field we&#39;re back to trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.730" end="00:47:46.650" style="s2">make sense of it in the prison-house of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:48.330" style="s2">language telling stories and making</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.650" end="00:47:49.859" style="s2">analogies or metaphors so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.330" end="00:47:53.609" style="s2">extinction I think we this distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.859" end="00:47:58.260" style="s2">think is quite helpful there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.609" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">two distinct uses of language this one</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.260" end="00:48:04.980" style="s2">over here</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:08.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll call semantic reality mapping this</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.980" end="00:48:11.810" style="s2">is really good for things like building</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.280" end="00:48:15.210" style="s2">houses or putting together battle plans</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.810" end="00:48:18.440" style="s2">it Orient&#39;s coordinated behavior where</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.210" end="00:48:20.340" style="s2">the checksum of reality is pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.440" end="00:48:23.130" style="s2">science does a lot of that science is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.340" end="00:48:28.410" style="s2">pretty much this kind of thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.130" end="00:48:30.210" style="s2">is poetry parable where the fingers</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.410" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">pointing to the moon and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.210" end="00:48:35.339" style="s2">the moon not the finger this we can use</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:37.260" style="s2">which is to be very careful that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.339" end="00:48:38.849" style="s2">not doing this so the problem that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.260" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">think happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.849" end="00:48:42.450" style="s2">particular with the folks that wear lots</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">of feathers and like to take too many</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.450" end="00:48:47.609" style="s2">drugs is they do this so they have an</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:49.050" style="s2">experience and then try to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.609" end="00:48:50.450" style="s2">science so prescriptive versus</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.450" end="00:48:55.320" style="s2">both really they do prescription and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.119" end="00:48:56.280" style="s2">descriptions because poetry is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.320" end="00:48:58.380" style="s2">really description</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.280" end="00:49:02.460" style="s2">it&#39;s an octave figurative versus literal</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.380" end="00:49:04.530" style="s2">yes yeah so the trick is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.460" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">actually be able to use language as some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.530" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">way of creating a a resonance frequency</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">or protocol match that generates a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:18.570" style="s2">capacity for communication that is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:21.109" style="s2">itself specifically semantic which I</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.570" end="00:49:23.670" style="s2">would propose both parable and poetry do</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.109" end="00:49:25.140" style="s2">it Orient&#39;s you in the direction of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.670" end="00:49:28.080" style="s2">feeling in yourself like thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.140" end="00:49:28.950" style="s2">poetry when you read a poem you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.080" end="00:49:31.140" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.950" end="00:49:35.820" style="s2">the poem but something about the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.140" end="00:49:39.810" style="s2">that the poem coordinates language helps</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.820" end="00:49:43.140" style="s2">you weren&#39;t in yourself to an experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.810" end="00:49:45.990" style="s2">that feels like the feeling that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:47.339" style="s2">poet was also feeling and so it creates</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.990" end="00:49:49.890" style="s2">a possibility of there being a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.339" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">connection at the level of interior</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.890" end="00:49:56.510" style="s2">feeling not a connection at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.680" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.510" end="00:50:02.900" style="s2">well sometimes something you&#39;re on I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:05.849" style="s2">mean it felt like you did have some</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.900" end="00:50:07.740" style="s2">future-forward practicality and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.849" end="00:50:11.460" style="s2">application in your initial description</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.740" end="00:50:14.760" style="s2">you said it does well with novelty and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.460" end="00:50:16.349" style="s2">it&#39;s anti fragile and there&#39;s me as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.760" end="00:50:17.550" style="s2">thought of it feel like timeless</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.349" end="00:50:22.349" style="s2">qualities but it for sure feels</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.550" end="00:50:25.710" style="s2">important now then going forward and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.349" end="00:50:28.530" style="s2">I was wondering because if we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.710" end="00:50:30.869" style="s2">the here&#39;s the instructions on how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.530" end="00:50:35.099" style="s2">get back here because then we&#39;ve named a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.869" end="00:50:38.849" style="s2">thing that&#39;s not the thing and emergent</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.099" end="00:50:42.900" style="s2">coherence is kind of this weird slippery</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.849" end="00:50:45.150" style="s2">thing to pin down you have communities</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.900" end="00:50:47.040" style="s2">of practice like Quakers and others that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.150" end="00:50:49.859" style="s2">have spent centuries and even you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:53.250" style="s2">generations passing on that knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.859" end="00:50:56.510" style="s2">was just with some indigenous for DNA</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.250" end="00:51:01.109" style="s2">and Lakota folks right and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.510" end="00:51:03.240" style="s2">infinite tradition of we will talk until</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.109" end="00:51:06.930" style="s2">the thing that needed to get done</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.240" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">emerges but nor are we on the clock</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.930" end="00:51:16.440" style="s2">and if this takes 10 minutes so BIA if</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:20.190" style="s2">this takes 10 days so be it so is there</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:25.319" style="s2">a version of this that is you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.190" end="00:51:27.270" style="s2">of quote-unquote scalable in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.319" end="00:51:30.210" style="s2">century there are moments of real beauty</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.270" end="00:51:32.579" style="s2">and real kind of emergent quality of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.210" end="00:51:36.119" style="s2">just old beautiful analogy beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.579" end="00:51:39.450" style="s2">beautiful comparison almost like this</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.119" end="00:51:41.430" style="s2">poetic lots of live poetic experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.450" end="00:51:42.950" style="s2">just on that point around drifting in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.430" end="00:51:44.990" style="s2">and out of coherence I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.950" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">something that for me was the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.990" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">learning of this whole exploration we</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:50.089" style="s2">did or are doing let&#39;s say around</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:52.339" style="s2">collective intelligence because we also</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.089" end="00:51:54.500" style="s2">ran a collective intelligence lab where</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.339" end="00:51:57.589" style="s2">we had three weekly sessions and we got</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.500" end="00:51:59.570" style="s2">about we only have space for about 20</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.589" end="00:52:01.550" style="s2">odd people and we got a b-plus</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.570" end="00:52:03.050" style="s2">kind of let&#39;s say people interested in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.550" end="00:52:04.730" style="s2">we ran it at cost so it was really just</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.050" end="00:52:06.530" style="s2">about seeing if we could get an</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.730" end="00:52:07.940" style="s2">interestingly diverse group of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.530" end="00:52:10.670" style="s2">together to start practicing some of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.940" end="00:52:12.349" style="s2">these things and really what we learned</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.670" end="00:52:13.550" style="s2">a lot and we made probably a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.349" end="00:52:16.579" style="s2">mistakes as well but it was very</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.550" end="00:52:19.609" style="s2">enjoyable as a process one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.579" end="00:52:21.140" style="s2">that has come out of me is that point</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.609" end="00:52:22.900" style="s2">about drifting in and out of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.140" end="00:52:25.400" style="s2">because that was the big takeaways that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.900" end="00:52:27.230" style="s2">coherence doesn&#39;t mean sameness and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.400" end="00:52:28.609" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re all agreeing all</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.230" end="00:52:31.099" style="s2">the time and there&#39;s a big I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.609" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge interesting thing to parse</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.099" end="00:52:34.460" style="s2">out it&#39;s not a problem for us to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:36.290" style="s2">disagree and there&#39;s no there&#39;s a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.460" end="00:52:38.329" style="s2">that I heard from a guy called Greg</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.290" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">Thomas recently who I spoke to is a jazz</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.329" end="00:52:42.589" style="s2">expert called antagonistic cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:43.970" style="s2">you&#39;ll get that in a jazz where you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.589" end="00:52:46.520" style="s2">a jazz kind of riff and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.970" end="00:52:48.050" style="s2">metaphor they use actually in the making</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.520" end="00:52:49.880" style="s2">sense of sense making conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.050" end="00:52:52.250" style="s2">there&#39;s someone comes in with a trumpet</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.880" end="00:52:53.960" style="s2">and then someone fights back with a you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.250" end="00:52:56.750" style="s2">know saxophone but they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.960" end="00:52:58.849" style="s2">towards a similar container so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.750" end="00:53:01.790" style="s2">still about cooperation but there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.849" end="00:53:03.800" style="s2">know there&#39;s conflict is okay and part</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.790" end="00:53:05.030" style="s2">of coherence is coming in and out of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.800" end="00:53:07.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s something we did in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.030" end="00:53:10.069" style="s2">you know we we established some</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.160" end="00:53:13.010" style="s2">coherence and then put in a question</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.069" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">that was punchy we&#39;re you know some some</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.010" end="00:53:15.740" style="s2">of them might have been you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.420" style="s2">them was just brexit good or bad and we</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.740" end="00:53:19.369" style="s2">had people stand at other sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.420" end="00:53:21.380" style="s2">room or would you rather have a male or</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.369" end="00:53:23.180" style="s2">female boss people standing over to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.380" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">room you know and they almost always</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.180" end="00:53:26.869" style="s2">split people almost in two which was</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:29.869" style="s2">great and then we brought those into</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.869" end="00:53:31.040" style="s2">conversation and almost inevitably those</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.869" end="00:53:32.270" style="s2">are the kinds of questions that bring us</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:34.250" style="s2">out of coherence because they really</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.270" end="00:53:36.500" style="s2">activate something in us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.250" end="00:53:38.150" style="s2">difficult to maintain it but part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.500" end="00:53:39.589" style="s2">process seems to be and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.150" end="00:53:41.030" style="s2">we&#39;ve spoken to have mentioned this so</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.589" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">Dinah Shore Hamilton has been on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.030" end="00:53:45.410" style="s2">channel recently and Bonita Roy as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:47.420" style="s2">that that is part of the process and for</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.410" end="00:53:48.619" style="s2">me that was a lesson because it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.420" end="00:53:50.420" style="s2">of just keep we can&#39;t just be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.619" end="00:53:52.670" style="s2">coherence all the time because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.420" end="00:53:55.589" style="s2">get that creative energy and that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.670" end="00:53:57.269" style="s2">juice that comes from polarity</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.589" end="00:53:58.469" style="s2">and so just finally on that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.269" end="00:53:59.940" style="s2">applies to the wider cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.469" end="00:54:02.549" style="s2">conversation that I think we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.940" end="00:54:03.900" style="s2">covering is that you know trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.549" end="00:54:06.690" style="s2">a way beyond tribal ization and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.900" end="00:54:08.069" style="s2">polarization doesn&#39;t mean trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.690" end="00:54:09.989" style="s2">some place where we&#39;re all thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.069" end="00:54:11.910" style="s2">same thing it just means that we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.989" end="00:54:13.549" style="s2">actually have the conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.910" end="00:54:16.259" style="s2">when we&#39;re in fight flight or freeze and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.549" end="00:54:17.489" style="s2">you know this this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.259" end="00:54:19.710" style="s2">science and psychology of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.489" end="00:54:20.759" style="s2">series we can&#39;t talk about anything we</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.710" end="00:54:23.190" style="s2">can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.759" end="00:54:24.749" style="s2">generative dialogue so we can still</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.190" end="00:54:26.249" style="s2">disagree but it&#39;s about whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.749" end="00:54:27.960" style="s2">shut down whether were frozen whether</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.249" end="00:54:30.269" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to fight or run away and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.960" end="00:54:31.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a real nuance between those two</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.269" end="00:54:33.809" style="s2">things and that&#39;s like a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.559" end="00:54:35.519" style="s2">continuous I think exploration of how do</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.809" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">we get that that balance right so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.519" end="00:54:39.960" style="s2">within a conversation any of us can feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:41.219" style="s2">into okay am i pushing back because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.960" end="00:54:43.259" style="s2">really feel this is an important point</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.219" end="00:54:46.739" style="s2">or am I feeling threatened that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.259" end="00:54:48.140" style="s2">attacking there&#39;s so much to it and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.739" end="00:54:49.769" style="s2">so many of the people we&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.140" end="00:54:51.660" style="s2">you know who&#39;ve been doing it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.769" end="00:54:53.369" style="s2">longer than us have come to December</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.660" end="00:54:55.739" style="s2">similar conclusions around that around</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.369" end="00:54:57.210" style="s2">the complexity of it and also how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.739" end="00:54:58.469" style="s2">we can get out of a practice like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.210" end="00:55:00.719" style="s2">around you know collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.469" end="00:55:02.309" style="s2">and generative conversation you make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.719" end="00:55:03.660" style="s2">really important point there I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.309" end="00:55:06.180" style="s2">it&#39;s worth highlighting and repeating</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.660" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">cuz I see a lot of confusion in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.180" end="00:55:10.229" style="s2">space and these kind of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:11.849" style="s2">around coherence and it&#39;s a point that</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.229" end="00:55:13.019" style="s2">Jamie wheel made to me the other day and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.849" end="00:55:14.489" style="s2">hopefully we&#39;ll get a chance to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.019" end="00:55:17.519" style="s2">do a recording around it at some point</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.489" end="00:55:20.190" style="s2">is you can&#39;t get to coherence by trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.519" end="00:55:21.869" style="s2">for coherence you can&#39;t wish your way</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.190" end="00:55:24.150" style="s2">into let&#39;s let&#39;s just let&#39;s just be in</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.869" end="00:55:26.190" style="s2">coherence right now you get to coherence</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.150" end="00:55:27.930" style="s2">through doing the hard thing you get to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.190" end="00:55:29.999" style="s2">coherence through go through going into</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.930" end="00:55:31.769" style="s2">the difficult conversations raising</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.999" end="00:55:33.450" style="s2">whatever&#39;s in the field and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.769" end="00:55:35.180" style="s2">working through it with no guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.450" end="00:55:37.529" style="s2">that that&#39;s going to happen but this</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.180" end="00:55:40.200" style="s2">coherence is the space on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.529" end="00:55:41.969" style="s2">of doing the hard things and that just</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.200" end="00:55:43.650" style="s2">has to it doesn&#39;t come from anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.969" end="00:55:45.180" style="s2">else and that was the other learning</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.650" end="00:55:47.759" style="s2">from putting on the collective</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.180" end="00:55:49.619" style="s2">intelligence lab was we realized it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.759" end="00:55:55.430" style="s2">very ambitious to try and create kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.619" end="00:55:58.140" style="s2">coherence in a group of say 20 strangers</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.430" end="00:56:00.359" style="s2">actually I think we got to some level of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.140" end="00:56:02.420" style="s2">coherence even with that because we were</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.359" end="00:56:04.769" style="s2">very lucky to have a very skilled</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.420" end="00:56:06.359" style="s2">circling facilitator John Thompson of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.769" end="00:56:08.670" style="s2">circling Europe who was helping us and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.359" end="00:56:09.329" style="s2">was incredibly good at his what he did</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.670" end="00:56:11.579" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.329" end="00:56:14.579" style="s2">in a really beautiful space but what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.579" end="00:56:16.499" style="s2">found we did manage was the five the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.579" end="00:56:18.390" style="s2">sewer who were putting it on because we</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.499" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">were having discussions about how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.390" end="00:56:21.769" style="s2">going to run the the workshop and all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">this stuff was coming up we had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.769" end="00:56:26.910" style="s2">arguments discussions very clearly what</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.670" style="s2">I found is we got to some level of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.910" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">emergence and coherence in the teaching</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.670" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">team with a shared goal with something</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:36.719" style="s2">that we were actually kind of moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.170" end="00:56:38.849" style="s2">towards with the kind of dedication and</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.719" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">ground rules that we will raise whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.849" end="00:56:42.479" style="s2">comes up between us we will say what</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:44.219" style="s2">we&#39;re feeling we&#39;ll make sure that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.479" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">everything is expressed then you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.219" end="00:56:49.049" style="s2">start moving towards coherence you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">get there through let&#39;s try and be in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.049" end="00:56:52.619" style="s2">coherence right now yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:54.660" style="s2">that&#39;s something we&#39;ve seen on our men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.619" end="00:56:55.950" style="s2">retreats as well it&#39;s it&#39;s the trials</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.660" end="00:56:58.529" style="s2">and tribulations of the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.950" end="00:57:01.559" style="s2">that that creates that trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.529" end="00:57:03.180" style="s2">unity between us and there&#39;s no and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.559" end="00:57:04.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no short cutting map yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.180" end="00:57:05.640" style="s2">the collective intelligence series is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.680" end="00:57:07.650" style="s2">definitely one that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.640" end="00:57:09.450" style="s2">return to quite a few times and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.650" end="00:57:11.789" style="s2">followed up with a really good interview</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.450" end="00:57:12.959" style="s2">with Bonita Roy who drew out some really</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.789" end="00:57:15.209" style="s2">important distinctions between</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.959" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">collective intelligence and what she</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.209" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">calls collective insight practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:23.180" style="s2">collective insight practice is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.329" end="00:57:32.029" style="s2">methodology for people to get together</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.369" end="00:57:37.199" style="s2">and together come up with insights</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.029" end="00:57:40.199" style="s2">knowings plans mental models ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.199" end="00:57:44.180" style="s2">neither any of them had when they answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.199" end="00:57:47.789" style="s2">together and it&#39;s not just some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.180" end="00:57:53.519" style="s2">mash-up of clips that people had it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.789" end="00:57:57.059" style="s2">something that affects people or seems</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.519" end="00:57:59.369" style="s2">to people as entirely novel and new and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.059" end="00:58:01.799" style="s2">they know they couldn&#39;t have come up</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.369" end="00:58:05.239" style="s2">with that without the participation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.799" end="00:58:08.009" style="s2">other people they know even the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.239" end="00:58:12.440" style="s2">nonlinear streams that they went off</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.009" end="00:58:15.900" style="s2">with someone in an argument or a wacky</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.440" end="00:58:21.690" style="s2">humorous thing all these somehow played</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.900" end="00:58:22.710" style="s2">a part and either disrupting the system</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.690" end="00:58:25.619" style="s2">we&#39;re moving the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.710" end="00:58:30.180" style="s2">you&#39;re creating new pathways for</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.619" end="00:58:34.290" style="s2">thinking in that everyone has held a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.180" end="00:58:37.800" style="s2">piece for this new paradigm shift or</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.290" end="00:58:41.790" style="s2">this new way of perceiving or new idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.800" end="00:58:43.800" style="s2">or new approach to have arisen so now</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.790" end="00:58:45.510" style="s2">we&#39;re in August and the war on</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.800" end="00:58:47.940" style="s2">sense-making piece with Daniel Schmidt</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.510" end="00:58:50.130" style="s2">hamburger which did surprisingly well</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.940" end="00:58:51.930" style="s2">like I it was a great piece and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.130" end="00:58:53.580" style="s2">thought it would do well but I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.930" end="00:58:55.260" style="s2">thinking sort of twenty thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.580" end="00:58:57.890" style="s2">something like that and then it just</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.260" end="00:59:00.030" style="s2">sort of kept going up and really caught</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.890" end="00:59:02.580" style="s2">caught the zeitgeist I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.030" end="00:59:05.250" style="s2">something very I mean he he laid it out</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.580" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">beautifully it&#39;s sort of a long one and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.250" end="00:59:08.910" style="s2">a half hour an analysis of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:11.010" style="s2">sense-making landscape the information</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.910" end="00:59:12.900" style="s2">ecology and why it&#39;s polluted which has</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.010" end="00:59:15.060" style="s2">been really really interesting to think</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.900" end="00:59:18.390" style="s2">about and to develop our own thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.060" end="00:59:20.099" style="s2">around these sort of ideas including</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.390" end="00:59:22.710" style="s2">sort of the idea of like ruler maker and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.099" end="00:59:25.140" style="s2">how how why is the information landscape</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.710" end="00:59:27.330" style="s2">so polluted and what do we do about kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.140" end="00:59:30.270" style="s2">of making it less polluted like to just</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.330" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">get a sense of why like how big a deal</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.270" end="00:59:35.900" style="s2">this is you take any of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">issues in the world like the issues that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.900" end="00:59:43.109" style="s2">could determine whether or not we keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:45.080" style="s2">existing as a species okay so take big</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.109" end="00:59:49.109" style="s2">environmental issues like climate change</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.080" end="00:59:50.580" style="s2">is there is disagreement as to whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.109" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">climate change is relieved in a thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.580" end="00:59:56.130" style="s2">and to the extent that it is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="01:00:06.540" style="s2">what the causes are and what the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.130" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">skills are now most people who believe</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.540" end="01:00:10.710" style="s2">fervently know climate change is real</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:13.560" style="s2">97% of climate scientists agree it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.710" end="01:00:14.520" style="s2">anthropogenic greenhouse gases etc most</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.560" end="01:00:16.470" style="s2">of the people that believe that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.520" end="01:00:18.119" style="s2">fervently enough to kind of like go into</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.470" end="01:00:19.800" style="s2">narrative warfare for it have never</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.119" end="01:00:23.099" style="s2">actually looked at the primary data</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.800" end="01:00:26.130" style="s2">deeply themselves and yet there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.099" end="01:00:28.650" style="s2">almost religious fervor around it that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.130" end="01:00:31.580" style="s2">was based on having proxied their sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.650" end="01:00:33.110" style="s2">making the people who they believe so</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.580" end="01:00:34.970" style="s2">do UN&#39;s headed or the Gates Foundation</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.110" end="01:00:37.100" style="s2">set it or whatever it is I&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.970" end="01:00:38.690" style="s2">repeated enough times just just through</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.100" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">repeatability like I have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.690" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2">programmed to believe this thing is true</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">which is not that different than</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:46.970" style="s2">believing a fundamentalist religion</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:50.410" style="s2">religious ideal right and let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.970" end="01:00:56.450" style="s2">take people&#39;s fervent ideas on vaccines</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.410" end="01:01:02.570" style="s2">or their fervent ideas on the viability</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.450" end="01:01:06.140" style="s2">of market ideology or almost anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.570" end="01:01:09.980" style="s2">like that almost no one who has fervent</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.140" end="01:01:11.330" style="s2">ideas has a good epistemic basis for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.980" end="01:01:13.010" style="s2">level of certainty they hold there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.330" end="01:01:14.540" style="s2">decoupling between how much certainty</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.010" end="01:01:16.940" style="s2">they have and how much certainty they</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.540" end="01:01:18.710" style="s2">should have through right process and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.940" end="01:01:20.180" style="s2">then you look at who are they proxying</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.710" end="01:01:21.350" style="s2">their sense making - in most the time</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.180" end="01:01:22.430" style="s2">they&#39;re not even proxying their sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.350" end="01:01:25.370" style="s2">making - the people who did the original</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.430" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">research many of whom disagree with each</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.370" end="01:01:29.240" style="s2">other and were funded by somebody to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:32.180" style="s2">something that is not fully true in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.240" end="01:01:35.570" style="s2">first place and who maybe were employing</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.180" end="01:01:38.360" style="s2">epistemic biases themselves but</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.570" end="01:01:40.100" style="s2">typically it&#39;s somebody else who looked</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.360" end="01:01:41.660" style="s2">at all of that and then someone else who</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.100" end="01:01:44.140" style="s2">looked at all of that so you might have</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.660" end="01:01:47.030" style="s2">like a bunch of climate scientists into</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.140" end="01:01:49.010" style="s2">someone who is at speaking about that as</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.030" end="01:01:50.930" style="s2">a client&#39;s climate scientists at a more</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.010" end="01:01:53.300" style="s2">synthetic level like a james hansen or</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.930" end="01:01:54.650" style="s2">whatever - then like a gor or someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.300" end="01:01:57.230" style="s2">who is actually speaking to the public</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.650" end="01:02:00.320" style="s2">who were proxying are sense-making - and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.230" end="01:02:03.070" style="s2">we say okay how many steps removed is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.320" end="01:02:05.750" style="s2">and how good was the original data</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.070" end="01:02:08.150" style="s2">and we had a lot less Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.750" end="01:02:09.470" style="s2">this year compared to last but just</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.150" end="01:02:11.450" style="s2">towards the end of the year I was in</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.470" end="01:02:13.880" style="s2">Toronto and took the opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.450" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">an interview with Patricia Marco Chia</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.880" end="01:02:19.340" style="s2">who directed the film the rise of Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">Peterson which had just come out and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.340" end="01:02:23.600" style="s2">really interesting part of that story is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:25.070" style="s2">that she didn&#39;t expect to make the film</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.600" end="01:02:26.420" style="s2">she ended up making she was really</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.070" end="01:02:28.730" style="s2">interested in Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.420" end="01:02:30.530" style="s2">philosophy Jordan Peterson&#39;s opinions</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.730" end="01:02:31.700" style="s2">about kind of religion and mythology and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.530" end="01:02:34.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what she wanted the film to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.700" end="01:02:36.350" style="s2">about originally and then as she was</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.130" end="01:02:38.270" style="s2">making it he released the professor</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.350" end="01:02:40.730" style="s2">against political correctness videos and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.270" end="01:02:42.800" style="s2">then suddenly became kind of as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.730" end="01:02:45.170" style="s2">described the one-man lightning rod for</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.800" end="01:02:46.430" style="s2">the culture war and then that story kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.170" end="01:02:48.350" style="s2">of overtook her and that&#39;s the one she</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.430" end="01:02:50.570" style="s2">ended up making one of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.350" end="01:02:53.050" style="s2">led me to his book maps of meaning early</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.570" end="01:02:56.060" style="s2">on was just from reading different</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.050" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">philosophers I sort of came to this</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.060" end="01:03:00.530" style="s2">conclusion that you can have two people</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">in the same room you know in the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.530" end="01:03:04.940" style="s2">place at the same coffee table in front</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:07.430" style="s2">of them but your belief system and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.940" end="01:03:09.350" style="s2">way you frame the world informs reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.430" end="01:03:11.060" style="s2">to the extent where we can literally be</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.350" end="01:03:12.350" style="s2">in two different realities even if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.060" end="01:03:15.290" style="s2">beside each other and this was like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.350" end="01:03:17.450" style="s2">big aha moment for me of well we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.290" end="01:03:19.700" style="s2">of screwed like how can people really</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.450" end="01:03:22.160" style="s2">understand each other and resolve</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.700" end="01:03:24.680" style="s2">conflicts and I remember that being the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.160" end="01:03:27.170" style="s2">initial thing that somehow led me I</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.680" end="01:03:31.190" style="s2">think through some Google search to maps</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.170" end="01:03:33.020" style="s2">of meaning so it&#39;s interesting how I you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.190" end="01:03:36.290" style="s2">know later found myself working on this</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.020" end="01:03:39.080" style="s2">film about Jordan&#39;s comments on Bill c16</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.290" end="01:03:40.340" style="s2">involving into all of this other these</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.080" end="01:03:43.390" style="s2">other issues of political correctness</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.340" end="01:03:48.680" style="s2">but with with this idea of culture war</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.390" end="01:03:51.170" style="s2">looming underneath all of that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.680" end="01:03:54.050" style="s2">been I guess an evolution of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.170" end="01:03:55.940" style="s2">different ideas and then just out in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.050" end="01:03:57.950" style="s2">last few weeks is war on sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.940" end="01:04:00.290" style="s2">too which obviously is a sequel to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.950" end="01:04:03.260" style="s2">Daniels piece where he talks a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.290" end="01:04:05.630" style="s2">about the kind of weaponization of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.260" end="01:04:07.730" style="s2">information ecology like how even true</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.630" end="01:04:09.350" style="s2">things can be weaponized and how even</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.730" end="01:04:10.790" style="s2">the information about how things a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.350" end="01:04:12.680" style="s2">weaponized can be weaponized and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.790" end="01:04:15.170" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of kind of like a Hall of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.680" end="01:04:16.700" style="s2">Mirrors but it&#39;s really beautifully put</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.170" end="01:04:20.410" style="s2">together and Daniel has a real</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.700" end="01:04:23.990" style="s2">for making quite abstract complex ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.410" end="01:04:25.940" style="s2">intelligible to people we can see that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.990" end="01:04:29.269" style="s2">these types of patterns have happened in</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.940" end="01:04:31.309" style="s2">the past and led to war and resets and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.269" end="01:04:36.910" style="s2">think that that&#39;s too costly to happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.309" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">again and so outside of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.910" end="01:04:40.940" style="s2">recognizing that and having that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:43.309" style="s2">motivate their willingness to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.940" end="01:04:46.010" style="s2">something really uncomfortable which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.309" end="01:04:47.869" style="s2">to be willing to disagree with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.010" end="01:04:49.700" style="s2">in-group that they&#39;re part of even where</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.869" end="01:04:52.700" style="s2">the in group will use ostracizing and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.700" end="01:04:56.299" style="s2">shaming as a way to hold them in line</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.700" end="01:04:58.430" style="s2">and to really engage with other people</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.299" end="01:05:01.160" style="s2">in perspectives and to not do the lazy</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.430" end="01:05:02.660" style="s2">thing of just defecting to the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.160" end="01:05:05.690" style="s2">making that someone else that you hold</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.660" end="01:05:08.539" style="s2">as legitimate Authority gave you but</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.690" end="01:05:10.279" style="s2">really engaging earnestly with all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.539" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">the perspectives that you can to try to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.279" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">understand what makes sense to then also</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">understand what a way forward that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:18.289" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like war looks like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:19.970" style="s2">think there are any good chances for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.289" end="01:05:25.039" style="s2">world unless a lot of people start doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.970" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">that earnestness and sincerity empowered</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:32.960" style="s2">by really deep courage and a deep kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:35.029" style="s2">of epistemic humility is going to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.960" end="01:05:39.740" style="s2">someone misfit for every in-group</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.029" end="01:05:41.150" style="s2">currently which is the valley crossing</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.740" end="01:05:43.309" style="s2">that people have to go through to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.150" end="01:05:46.099" style="s2">basically leave the forces that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.309" end="01:05:50.150" style="s2">irate arrayed in a war that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.099" end="01:05:52.160" style="s2">sides are wrong to hopefully have enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.150" end="01:05:54.740" style="s2">people who do that that start to find</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.160" end="01:05:58.690" style="s2">each other and don&#39;t do a new tribal</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.740" end="01:06:01.700" style="s2">groupthink thing but all engage in</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.690" end="01:06:03.859" style="s2">earnest actual thinking themselves an</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.700" end="01:06:06.559" style="s2">actual conversation without orienting</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.859" end="01:06:08.420" style="s2">towards groupthink that can start to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:10.440" style="s2">make a new strange attractor</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.420" end="01:06:12.989" style="s2">so we&#39;re really pleased that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.440" end="01:06:15.569" style="s2">him coming as one of our main speakers</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.989" end="01:06:17.400" style="s2">for the rebel wisdom festival in May</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.569" end="01:06:19.170" style="s2">next year so just time to talk about a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.400" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">few of the films that are coming up at</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.170" end="01:06:22.710" style="s2">the beginning of 2020 which I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:24.299" style="s2">people will really enjoy because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.710" end="01:06:27.569" style="s2">taking on some of the inquiries that</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.299" end="01:06:29.309" style="s2">we&#39;ve been engaged in this year firstly</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.569" end="01:06:31.229" style="s2">there&#39;s playing with a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.309" end="01:06:33.900" style="s2">different titles for this potentially</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.229" end="01:06:35.969" style="s2">it&#39;s war on sense-making 3 with Janie</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.900" end="01:06:37.559" style="s2">Weil responding to some of the points</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.969" end="01:06:39.869" style="s2">that Daniel made in war and sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.559" end="01:06:40.829" style="s2">and it may be called warrants that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.869" end="01:06:43.079" style="s2">making three and may be called the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.829" end="01:06:44.609" style="s2">infinite game because that sort of seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.079" end="01:06:46.469" style="s2">like a more appropriate name for what</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.609" end="01:06:50.130" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of sketching out and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.469" end="01:06:52.829" style="s2">also a piece called culture war 2.0 from</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.130" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">a new correspondent in Toronto Peter</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.829" end="01:06:58.410" style="s2">Lindbergh and he if people have bring it</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:06:59.849" style="s2">up and put the the link in the show</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.410" end="01:07:02.910" style="s2">notes here he wrote a piece called</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.849" end="01:07:04.529" style="s2">culture war 2.0 and coined a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.910" end="01:07:08.309" style="s2">these really useful phrases like mimetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.529" end="01:07:10.109" style="s2">mediation the gray pill and so we&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.309" end="01:07:11.969" style="s2">it together with graphics an interview</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.109" end="01:07:14.519" style="s2">that I did with him out in Toronto the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.969" end="01:07:15.779" style="s2">idea was an invitation to the reader to</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.519" end="01:07:18.569" style="s2">look at it from a different perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.779" end="01:07:20.279" style="s2">and I view this this this whole hallway</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.569" end="01:07:22.259" style="s2">paper in the mega tribes in the frame</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.279" end="01:07:24.479" style="s2">that this is a multipolar almost</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.259" end="01:07:27.359" style="s2">postmodern war is this sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.479" end="01:07:29.069" style="s2">psychoactive drug because if you see the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.359" end="01:07:30.599" style="s2">mimetic tribe that you belong to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.069" end="01:07:32.700" style="s2">alongside all these other mimetic tribes</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.599" end="01:07:34.589" style="s2">that might jog you out of your belief</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.700" end="01:07:35.999" style="s2">system just for a moment I hope that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.589" end="01:07:38.700" style="s2">does really really well because I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.999" end="01:07:41.009" style="s2">a lot of the terms and the framings and</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.009" end="01:07:44.999" style="s2">landscape it&#39;s really really important</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.869" end="01:07:46.710" style="s2">really really useful for us to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.999" end="01:07:49.259" style="s2">play with going forward and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.710" end="01:07:51.739" style="s2">will open up a new kind of Vista and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.259" end="01:07:54.599" style="s2">understanding about what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.739" end="01:07:56.160" style="s2">going forward into 2020 so you mentioned</p>
