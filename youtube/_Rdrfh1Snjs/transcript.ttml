<p begin="00:00:29.609" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">incredible pace and having skipped a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">live stream because it was impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:39.660" style="s2">do from the road</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">we now have even more things that have</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.660" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">transpired in the in the period between</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">this one in our last live stream we</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">wanted to start with a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">logistics though couple of logistics yep</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">we wanted to mention the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:54.530" style="s2">Clips channel which is now live which</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.840" style="s2">will have clips already has clips from</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.530" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">many of the previous episodes you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.840" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">find that at Dark Horse clips there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">no a discord server which you can get</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:08.460" style="s2">access to as a benefit at either of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">patreon at the $5 an uplevel and we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.460" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">something called Dark Horse membership</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">at my patreon at the $5 an uplevel which</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:16.970" style="s2">gives you access to a private Q&amp;A one</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">every month we&#39;re gonna have to refigure</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.970" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">the level at which people get to ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">questions because it&#39;s been more</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">successful they were expecting and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:26.189" style="s2">already have too many questions at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">11 dollar level but but we do that on</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.189" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">the last Sunday of the month and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">Brett also does conversations at higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">levels on the first Saturdays and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">Sundays of every month at his patreon so</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">those are some things going on and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">evident those conversations have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:43.229" style="s2">spectacular of late I&#39;m I&#39;m thrilled</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">with what they&#39;ve they&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.229" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">they were spectacular before but they</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">were smaller and then people have joined</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">in and they&#39;ve discovered that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">an ongoing conversation and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">lot of enthusiasm so anyway consider</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">that fabulous and would you like to give</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">any updates to Unity 2020 yes it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">be slightly vague but I would like you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">to deduce from the tone of my voice that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">things are moving in an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">direction with unity 2020 we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:10.880" style="s2">discovering what Unity 2020 is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:15.380" style="s2">of course it is not a ploy</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.880" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">party right so unity 2020 is moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.380" end="00:02:20.300" style="s2">rapidly in the right direction of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">what we need is the groundswell what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.300" end="00:02:26.450" style="s2">have now is a large team of very capable</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:28.580" style="s2">Patriots who are putting every effort</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.450" end="00:02:30.260" style="s2">into this thing and generating amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.580" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">stuff which you will soon see and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.260" end="00:02:34.430" style="s2">think you will be very pleased at what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">it is and then the question is how many</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.430" end="00:02:38.420" style="s2">communities that are actually aligned</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:39.890" style="s2">with unity 2020 that might have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.420" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">working on a different part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.890" end="00:02:44.540" style="s2">puzzle are going to recognize us as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:48.530" style="s2">fellow travelers and join in because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.540" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">fact is if we don&#39;t solve this stifling</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.530" end="00:02:53.930" style="s2">governmental corruption problem that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:55.340" style="s2">managed by the duopoly to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.930" end="00:02:57.050" style="s2">meaningful change if we don&#39;t fix that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.340" end="00:02:57.530" style="s2">none of the other things are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.050" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">fixable</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.530" end="00:03:02.570" style="s2">everything else is downstream of that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">really we got to go we got to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.570" end="00:03:07.850" style="s2">the time is now because the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:13.220" style="s2">so critical it can&#39;t possibly wait</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.850" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">another election cycle okay all right</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.220" end="00:03:18.920" style="s2">so where should we begin should we begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:23.930" style="s2">with a discussion of where we are with</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.920" end="00:03:26.900" style="s2">respect to kovat yeah all right kovat so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.930" end="00:03:29.150" style="s2">the big thing I&#39;m seeing very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.900" end="00:03:30.860" style="s2">is people are talking about well cases</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.150" end="00:03:34.760" style="s2">are skyrocketing again which we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.860" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">talk about but the case fatality rate is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.760" end="00:03:40.490" style="s2">actually flat or down um which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.620" style="s2">interesting and I think we should talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.490" end="00:03:44.120" style="s2">about what the meaning is in one sense I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.620" end="00:03:46.550" style="s2">don&#39;t understand why the surprises</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.120" end="00:03:49.430" style="s2">anybody we botched the lockdown and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.550" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">having botched to lock down the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.430" end="00:03:53.690" style="s2">wave was absolutely predictable and many</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:55.820" style="s2">of us predicted it so let&#39;s just say I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.690" end="00:03:58.130" style="s2">think probably all the viewers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.820" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">listeners will understand this but when</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.130" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">we are saying we in this case we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">talking very much as as American as</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:06.680" style="s2">American citizens you have the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:07.970" style="s2">States of America not across for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.680" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">most part the rest of America and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.970" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">certainly not across the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:14.930" style="s2">world the United States uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:17.270" style="s2">this one up really bad yeah really bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.930" end="00:04:21.169" style="s2">and in some sense worst of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.270" end="00:04:24.380" style="s2">worlds because what we did was we went</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.169" end="00:04:26.750" style="s2">maybe 70% of the way to in effect</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.380" end="00:04:28.280" style="s2">locked down which caused everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.750" end="00:04:29.780" style="s2">grow thoroughly tired of it and many</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">people to rebel against it without</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.780" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">getting much of the benefit at all just</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:38.300" style="s2">enough to destroy large sectors of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:39.890" style="s2">economy to impinge on everyone&#39;s mental</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.300" end="00:04:42.140" style="s2">health many people&#39;s physical health and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.890" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">to make everyone so exhausted with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.140" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">saying that it is at least one for sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:49.070" style="s2">of the factors that led to the protests</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">that then became riots in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.070" end="00:04:52.640" style="s2">starting the beginning of June yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">it also in maybe you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.640" end="00:04:57.590" style="s2">this is actually a positive thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:59.450" style="s2">revealed the double standard that exists</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.590" end="00:05:01.190" style="s2">inside our sense making apparatus where</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.450" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">everybody was demon ated demonizing one</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.190" end="00:05:05.660" style="s2">set of protesters and giving another set</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">of protesters a pass for for being out</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.660" end="00:05:10.430" style="s2">there and not social distancing now of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:13.240" style="s2">course we have to put this in context</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.430" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">those protests occurred outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">outdoors appears to be relatively safe</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:18.470" style="s2">for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:20.150" style="s2">we have predicted that that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.470" end="00:05:22.610" style="s2">decrease over time but for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.150" end="00:05:24.650" style="s2">outdoor seems to be a safe environment</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.610" end="00:05:26.480" style="s2">now of course as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.650" end="00:05:28.640" style="s2">before we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s safe during</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.480" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">the day because of UV light or safe all</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.640" end="00:05:32.630" style="s2">the time due to the volume and air flow</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:34.100" style="s2">and therefore never crossing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.630" end="00:05:36.650" style="s2">threshold of viral load that makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.100" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">people sick well I think we know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.650" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">actually pretty well know that both of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">those things are protective do explain</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">part of why it is so much safer as to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:51.230" style="s2">almost be actually completely safe to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:55.640" style="s2">outdoors during the pandemic that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.230" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">increased airflow because density of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.640" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">viral load is completely predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:02.270" style="s2">whether or not you can infect it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:04.640" style="s2">also of how sick you get once you do get</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.270" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">infected both of those things and also</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:08.180" style="s2">it&#39;s true that sunlight does destroy</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:10.430" style="s2">this particular virus as it does many</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">others so and so we would expect there</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:15.290" style="s2">will be some less protective effects of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:16.640" style="s2">being outdoors at night but that those</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.290" end="00:06:17.900" style="s2">effects will certainly not disappear</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">entirely because I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.900" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">sense of of those two factors and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:23.390" style="s2">sure there are more but of those two</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.870" end="00:06:25.970" style="s2">factors basically increased air flow</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.390" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">being outside and sunlight being outside</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.970" end="00:06:29.750" style="s2">which of those you know if I had to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:32.390" style="s2">percentages to how important they are I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:34.430" style="s2">don&#39;t honestly know well here I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.390" end="00:06:36.920" style="s2">do my famous English to English</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.430" end="00:06:39.170" style="s2">translation service Wow</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.920" end="00:06:40.550" style="s2">that&#39;s seriously my job right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.170" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2">also your famous English English</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.550" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">translation service so in this case what</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.500" end="00:06:45.830" style="s2">I would argue is that we have a model</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.420" style="s2">and we should all be building models</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.830" end="00:06:48.890" style="s2">based on what we understand and our</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.420" end="00:06:50.300" style="s2">models were really cruddy at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.890" end="00:06:51.620" style="s2">beginning of kovat and we were all so</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.300" end="00:06:53.870" style="s2">worried about washing our hands and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.620" end="00:06:55.310" style="s2">touching surfaces which is important but</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.870" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">it turns out for this particular virus</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.310" end="00:07:00.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not nearly where the game is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">game is all in this other realm or</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.410" end="00:07:06.410" style="s2">almost all the the key though is for</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:08.360" style="s2">reasons that are yet to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.410" end="00:07:09.740" style="s2">articulated you have to cross some</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.360" end="00:07:11.390" style="s2">threshold of the number of viral</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.740" end="00:07:13.700" style="s2">particles that you encounter immune</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.390" end="00:07:15.320" style="s2">systems with a nonspecific response seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.700" end="00:07:17.630" style="s2">to be able to deal with some number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.320" end="00:07:19.460" style="s2">these things and so a conversation of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.630" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">minute or two even with a sick person is</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.460" end="00:07:23.450" style="s2">unlikely to cross that threshold a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">five-minute conversation is much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.450" end="00:07:27.380" style="s2">likely to a five-minute conversation in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:29.090" style="s2">an enclosed space that captures all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.380" end="00:07:31.670" style="s2">those particles so they&#39;re all unable to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.090" end="00:07:33.890" style="s2">diffuse a way makes it even worse and if</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.670" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">you&#39;re outside you got to think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.890" end="00:07:37.730" style="s2">got a bucket that you&#39;re filling with</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:39.500" style="s2">viral particles and if you cross the top</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.730" end="00:07:41.510" style="s2">of the bucket you get sick but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.500" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">bucket is being emptied by the UV light</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.510" end="00:07:44.750" style="s2">which is killing viral particles at some</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:47.390" style="s2">rapes of the bucket and by the air flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.750" end="00:07:48.860" style="s2">well the air flow means that the bucket</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.390" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">isn&#39;t filling very fast because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.860" end="00:07:53.630" style="s2">diffusing away and they&#39;re also dying</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.370" style="s2">right the UV light is killing them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.630" end="00:07:57.560" style="s2">so those two things are removing these</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.370" end="00:07:59.270" style="s2">things yeah it&#39;s the concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.560" end="00:08:00.970" style="s2">environments that make you much more</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.270" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">likely to get sick and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.970" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">environments that dispel or kill these</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.140" end="00:08:08.210" style="s2">things that make it much less likely for</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:11.780" style="s2">you to catch and people are both so poor</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.210" end="00:08:14.150" style="s2">at understanding these nuances and being</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.780" end="00:08:17.030" style="s2">educated so badly by the media and by</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.150" end="00:08:18.980" style="s2">scientists that for the most part we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.030" end="00:08:21.530" style="s2">falling into as I&#39;ve been saying since</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.980" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">almost the beginning these these tribes</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.530" end="00:08:25.220" style="s2">these you know starbella stages and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.300" end="00:08:28.100" style="s2">stages without and so you know we see</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.220" end="00:08:29.810" style="s2">now when we when we when we go out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.100" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">there are people wearing masks and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.810" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">know in the state of Oregon where we</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">live it is now mandated to wear masks</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:40.070" style="s2">inside and an outside and there&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:44.030" style="s2">twist to this as of yesterday but</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.070" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">outside mostly people are not wearing</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.030" end="00:08:48.590" style="s2">masks which is a legitimate move and yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:49.910" style="s2">you can also see in the eyes of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.590" end="00:08:51.830" style="s2">that they are judge</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:52.970" style="s2">you and assuming that if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.830" end="00:08:54.290" style="s2">wearing a mask you&#39;re one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.970" end="00:08:55.730" style="s2">people who doesn&#39;t ever want to wear</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.290" end="00:08:56.990" style="s2">masks and that&#39;s not to say that any of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.730" end="00:08:58.700" style="s2">us want to be wearing masks but</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.990" end="00:09:00.290" style="s2">understanding the necessity of wearing</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.700" end="00:09:03.140" style="s2">masks when you&#39;re inside with strangers</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.290" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">is very different from imagining that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.140" end="00:09:08.630" style="s2">mask wearing every time you leave your</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:10.820" style="s2">home is necessary so let me say that on</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.630" end="00:09:12.710" style="s2">a next door which is you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.820" end="00:09:15.170" style="s2">app it will be familiar to many people</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.710" end="00:09:20.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of neighborhood connection</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.170" end="00:09:22.190" style="s2">device just yesterday we had someone in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:24.020" style="s2">our neighborhood post with regard to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.190" end="00:09:26.660" style="s2">several hundred acre park that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.020" end="00:09:27.860" style="s2">dear us I walked in the state park today</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.660" end="00:09:29.060" style="s2">and I was disappointed that fifty</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.860" end="00:09:30.590" style="s2">percent of people were not wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.060" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">face covering if people can&#39;t or won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.590" end="00:09:33.770" style="s2">wear a face mask she wrote they should</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">not use trails it is selfish and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.770" end="00:09:36.650" style="s2">reckless to not wear a face covering on</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.270" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">a trail please walk on neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.650" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">streets instead now I responded and for</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">the first time ever our next-door you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:47.210" style="s2">know carefully and respectfully and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:50.630" style="s2">got many thanks for it and the original</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.210" end="00:09:54.380" style="s2">post has since been pulled down but you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.630" end="00:09:56.810" style="s2">know again this points to the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.380" end="00:09:58.430" style="s2">nuance in someone&#39;s understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.810" end="00:10:01.700" style="s2">one of the things I said in response to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.430" end="00:10:04.700" style="s2">her was we we should not be imposing</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.700" end="00:10:06.590" style="s2">rules that are neutral or even unhealthy</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.700" end="00:10:08.210" style="s2">for people certainly unhealthy for</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.590" end="00:10:09.500" style="s2">people with you know everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.210" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">suffering some mental health effects</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.500" end="00:10:13.580" style="s2">from this you know months long lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.440" style="s2">now and some people with physical</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.580" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">problems are going to be impaired if</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">they have to wear masks will not</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">therefore go outside if they have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:22.510" style="s2">wear masks to do so and will be further</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:25.970" style="s2">impaired as a result of that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.510" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">imposing bad rules on people is going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.970" end="00:10:29.990" style="s2">make many good people less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.070" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">follow all rules which includes not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.990" end="00:10:34.030" style="s2">the bad ones but the good ones as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:35.780" style="s2">that is the opposite of what we want I</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.030" end="00:10:37.730" style="s2">totally agree with this and I am</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.780" end="00:10:39.770" style="s2">experiencing I probably experienced it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.730" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">little bit less because my version of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.770" end="00:10:44.600" style="s2">mask it&#39;s some sort of signal it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">not wearing it results in people even</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.600" end="00:10:49.280" style="s2">when I know that my model is quite good</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:52.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually based on data in as</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.280" end="00:10:54.380" style="s2">much as we have that yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.400" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">sense of like oh you&#39;re one of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.380" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">anti mask people and and let me just</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">remind people who have been tuning and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:02.970" style="s2">more recently that we started these live</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:05.910" style="s2">streams on March</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.970" end="00:11:07.709" style="s2">20 forests and our very first one we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.910" end="00:11:09.240" style="s2">talked about mass this is before the who</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.709" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">this is before the Surgeon General had</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.240" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">said Oh oops sorry our bad that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.569" style="s2">actually a political moved on a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">scientific one it turns out masks are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.569" end="00:11:20.100" style="s2">useful after all we just have a shortage</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">so we were advocating for this before</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.100" end="00:11:24.120" style="s2">the mainstream everybody&#39;s throw masks</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:25.649" style="s2">it&#39;s us but but I think you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.120" end="00:11:27.660" style="s2">really want to emphasize what you just</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.649" end="00:11:29.069" style="s2">said it I&#39;ve landed in exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.660" end="00:11:32.250" style="s2">place which is that there is a missing</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.069" end="00:11:33.959" style="s2">category here which is okay that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.250" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">person&#39;s anti-mask they&#39;re not wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.959" end="00:11:37.199" style="s2">mask even in close quarters okay I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:38.639" style="s2">think that there&#39;s some shame that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.199" end="00:11:40.170" style="s2">belongs there unless there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.639" end="00:11:42.689" style="s2">reason that they&#39;re not wearing it right</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.170" end="00:11:44.250" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the pro mask people who</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.309" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">driven around with my mask not because I</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.029" end="00:12:49.350" style="s2">that much of an imposition so somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.699" end="00:12:51.959" style="s2">was a sophisticated model should not be</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">that attacks</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.680" end="00:17:47.490" style="s2">vital organs right it attacks your</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.770" style="s2">circulatory system it creates blood</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.490" end="00:17:54.300" style="s2">clots so the point is a list of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.770" end="00:17:56.790" style="s2">is is huge and the ongoing hazard to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.300" end="00:17:58.970" style="s2">is also very large we&#39;ve known for</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.790" end="00:18:03.080" style="s2">months there have been stories of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:06.180" style="s2">respiratory reduced function after</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.080" end="00:18:09.030" style="s2">recovery from kovat but the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.180" end="00:18:10.800" style="s2">function being less in many you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.030" end="00:18:13.290" style="s2">haven&#39;t I have not seen the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.800" end="00:18:16.170" style="s2">paper that there relates this yet but</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.290" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">many journalistic accounts and and other</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.170" end="00:18:20.790" style="s2">anecdotal accounts the people who say</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:24.570" style="s2">there they have they have brain fog</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.790" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">they&#39;re unable to find the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.570" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">thoughts and motivation that they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.840" style="s2">accustomed to having and that they had</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:32.670" style="s2">before they were infected now of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.840" end="00:18:35.370" style="s2">some of that with regard to motivation</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.670" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">you met many of us I would say all of us</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:41.190" style="s2">have have been affected by lockdown and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:41.970" style="s2">you cannot predict in advance what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:45.890" style="s2">that will do</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.970" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">but people reporting that post recovery</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.890" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the same brain they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:52.920" style="s2">recognized from before tells us exactly</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:53.910" style="s2">as you said and as we said back and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.920" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">know one of the episodes one through</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.910" end="00:19:00.290" style="s2">eighteen when we were largely focusing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:19:03.270" style="s2">on this that just looking at deaths is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.290" end="00:19:06.650" style="s2">really reductionist way to assess what</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.270" end="00:19:09.630" style="s2">the damage from this virus is yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.650" end="00:19:11.670" style="s2">it misses it because the point is if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.630" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">have a decade or two knocked off your</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.670" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">life by virtue of the damage done to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:17.340" style="s2">your internal organs you want to count</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:20.460" style="s2">that the fact that you didn&#39;t die in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.340" end="00:19:22.710" style="s2">hospital is is not the sum total of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.460" end="00:19:24.450" style="s2">story so let&#39;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.710" end="00:19:26.370" style="s2">why people are dying less and why I</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.450" end="00:19:28.830" style="s2">would say if we didn&#39;t explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.370" end="00:19:30.980" style="s2">predict it it wasn&#39;t it was implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.830" end="00:19:34.730" style="s2">predicted by many of the things we said</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.980" end="00:19:37.140" style="s2">the fact is you have a brand-new virus</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.730" end="00:19:39.390" style="s2">it is spreading like wildfire and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.140" end="00:19:42.120" style="s2">doctors are seeing it in large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.390" end="00:19:43.860" style="s2">right those doctors are fielding it best</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.120" end="00:19:46.260" style="s2">they can based on the next nearest</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.860" end="00:19:47.370" style="s2">phenomenon that they know and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.260" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">it turns out to have been</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.370" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">counterproductive or on an ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:54.420" style="s2">and they learned right they may not even</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:19:55.800" style="s2">fully understand what they have learned</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.420" end="00:19:57.030" style="s2">some hospitals may have learned better</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.800" end="00:20:00.030" style="s2">than others but</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.030" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">doctors in contact over the internet</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.030" end="00:20:04.410" style="s2">will have exchanged information and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:07.110" style="s2">are getting better at dealing with kovat</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.410" end="00:20:10.170" style="s2">patient we highlighted early on in late</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.110" end="00:20:12.630" style="s2">March and mid early to mid April for</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.170" end="00:20:14.070" style="s2">instance some few doctors saying I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.630" end="00:20:15.390" style="s2">sure ventilators is the right way to go</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.070" end="00:20:17.010" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t look like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.390" end="00:20:20.280" style="s2">disease why have we why have we</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.010" end="00:20:23.910" style="s2">formulated it that way and this this to</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.280" end="00:20:26.280" style="s2">your point that it could well be but in</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.910" end="00:20:28.680" style="s2">fact care for people with this disease</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.280" end="00:20:30.390" style="s2">is simply getting more effective care</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.680" end="00:20:32.040" style="s2">for this will get more effective it will</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.390" end="00:20:33.720" style="s2">continue to get more effective another</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.040" end="00:20:37.400" style="s2">thing that happens is evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.720" end="00:20:40.350" style="s2">hosts get less affected by disease now</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.400" end="00:20:42.930" style="s2">the evolution that accounts for that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.350" end="00:20:45.180" style="s2">primarily on the host side the virus may</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.930" end="00:20:46.380" style="s2">also have an interest in not damaging</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.180" end="00:20:48.900" style="s2">the host so much that it doesn&#39;t walk</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.380" end="00:20:51.420" style="s2">around and spread it but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.900" end="00:20:53.640" style="s2">there&#39;s also evolution so in this case</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.420" end="00:20:56.160" style="s2">probably there hasn&#39;t been enough death</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.640" end="00:20:58.050" style="s2">yet to account for this but the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.160" end="00:20:59.730" style="s2">what if you had some fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.050" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">population that was spectacular Li</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.730" end="00:21:03.870" style="s2">likely to contract and die from this</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:06.150" style="s2">virus by virtue of some molecular</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.870" end="00:21:08.250" style="s2">feature of its cell surface or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.150" end="00:21:09.720" style="s2">like that then a lot of those people</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.250" end="00:21:12.090" style="s2">would have been caught in the first wave</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.720" end="00:21:13.950" style="s2">that means that the those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.090" end="00:21:15.300" style="s2">remain are in the category we are more</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.950" end="00:21:17.580" style="s2">likely to be in the category of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.300" end="00:21:18.930" style="s2">who aren&#39;t quite that vulnerable so can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.580" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">I do one of these English English</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.930" end="00:21:23.790" style="s2">translations here wonderful yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:26.580" style="s2">really just to exactly restate what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.790" end="00:21:30.450" style="s2">just said but there will be some range</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.580" end="00:21:31.770" style="s2">of effects for any pathogen and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.450" end="00:21:33.930" style="s2">let&#39;s just make up some numbers here</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.770" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">maybe 20% of a population will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.930" end="00:21:36.060" style="s2">affected very badly and die no matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.060" end="00:21:42.840" style="s2">and another 60% there is some range of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.820" style="s2">possible effects maybe 20% you know have</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:46.470" style="s2">almost no no symptoms at all and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.820" end="00:21:47.820" style="s2">numbers are not reflective of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.470" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">going on with Co but I just made up some</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.820" end="00:21:52.140" style="s2">numbers but when when the thing first</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:55.020" style="s2">starts to when the pathogens first start</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.140" end="00:21:58.950" style="s2">state of population everyone in that 20%</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.020" end="00:22:01.230" style="s2">who is infected will dock and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.950" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">people are then no longer in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.230" end="00:22:06.570" style="s2">population and so you will see that 20%</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:10.200" style="s2">shrink and shrink and shrink over time</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.570" end="00:22:11.790" style="s2">such that what the original numbers were</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.200" end="00:22:13.230" style="s2">will change and therefore the CFR the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.790" end="00:22:16.530" style="s2">case fatality rate will change as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.230" end="00:22:20.780" style="s2">and will decrease yep so don&#39;t be misled</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.530" end="00:22:24.210" style="s2">by the CFR dropping thing that we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.780" end="00:22:25.500" style="s2">being told a more dire story than we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.210" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">actually have on our hands this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.500" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">actually quite dire and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:31.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not I would encourage you to go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:34.340" style="s2">that subreddit and look at the story</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.980" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">after story of people dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.340" end="00:22:38.550" style="s2">terrible symptoms that you just really</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.230" style="s2">don&#39;t want to have to deal with and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.550" end="00:22:43.680" style="s2">must say even though I think we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.230" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">incredibly conscious and vigilant about</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.680" end="00:22:46.260" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">I even spooked myself reading this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.260" end="00:22:50.310" style="s2">it was like wow do you just not want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:51.810" style="s2">be in these people&#39;s shoes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.310" end="00:22:53.640" style="s2">I hate to say that because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.810" end="00:22:55.080" style="s2">to add to their burden like yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.640" end="00:22:58.050" style="s2">know we&#39;re distancing ourselves from</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.080" end="00:23:00.600" style="s2">them but wow they are a cautionary tale</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.050" end="00:23:02.610" style="s2">and we ought to be thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.600" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">carefully just as you you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.610" end="00:23:08.010" style="s2">said in some sense we&#39;ve just have game</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.010" end="00:23:12.540" style="s2">and one of the game theory problems here</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">is that you know okay</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.790" end="00:23:56.940" style="s2">pretty much I think all of Europe all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.250" end="00:24:00.660" style="s2">Asia all of Africa are off limits and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.940" end="00:24:02.160" style="s2">this is this is new for Americans right</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.660" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">we are we&#39;re accustomed be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.160" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">wherever we want to be it&#39;s easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:06.990" style="s2">visas if you need visas at all then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:08.430" style="s2">rest of the world has looked at what</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.990" end="00:24:11.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve done and looked at what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.430" end="00:24:13.770" style="s2">happening now and said nope we rest the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.880" end="00:24:16.770" style="s2">world largely did a far better job than</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.770" end="00:24:17.580" style="s2">you did and you and your infection are</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.580" end="00:24:21.270" style="s2">right which is scary because you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.040" end="00:24:23.700" style="s2">there are a lot of things that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.270" end="00:24:25.320" style="s2">happen going forward one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.700" end="00:24:27.419" style="s2">could be four years out from a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">if a vaccine is even conceivable here</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.419" end="00:24:32.730" style="s2">and I do think a vaccine is likely but</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:34.529" style="s2">you know the the best experts in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.730" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">world of vaccines are not hopeful about</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.529" end="00:24:38.700" style="s2">one in the next year right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:40.049" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say it&#39;s impossible I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.700" end="00:24:41.519" style="s2">seen some stuff that&#39;s hopeful but</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.049" end="00:24:43.830" style="s2">there&#39;s also hype and it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.519" end="00:24:46.679" style="s2">separate those two things so how long</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.830" end="00:24:49.230" style="s2">exactly are we gonna go being unable to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.679" end="00:24:51.000" style="s2">travel you know to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:53.010" style="s2">right that&#39;s another that&#39;s an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.000" end="00:24:54.149" style="s2">different set of cost that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.010" end="00:24:58.830" style="s2">start paying and it&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.149" end="00:25:01.830" style="s2">profound economic implications so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.830" end="00:25:04.350" style="s2">and and for those of us for some of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.830" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a small effect in</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.350" end="00:25:09.570" style="s2">the global list of effects but have</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">tremendous mental health effects Oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.570" end="00:25:14.279" style="s2">tremendous mental health effects but</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:17.159" style="s2">yeah I mean look we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.279" end="00:25:18.659" style="s2">world we did not prepare for right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.159" end="00:25:20.789" style="s2">one in which we cannot travel to other</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.659" end="00:25:25.230" style="s2">places there are things that require</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.789" end="00:25:29.429" style="s2">travel and so there&#39;s a question which</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.230" end="00:25:31.500" style="s2">is really okay we just got slapped right</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.429" end="00:25:33.570" style="s2">we learned a lesson which is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.500" end="00:25:35.539" style="s2">bravado stuff was not going to get you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.570" end="00:25:37.620" style="s2">through this by virtue of just you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.539" end="00:25:39.330" style="s2">bucking up and letting some people die</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.620" end="00:25:40.919" style="s2">and you know we&#39;d get to the other end</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.330" end="00:25:44.340" style="s2">and herd immunity and all of that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.919" end="00:25:47.940" style="s2">facing a renewed nightmare and a renewed</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.340" end="00:25:49.980" style="s2">nightmare that we now have in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.940" end="00:25:52.139" style="s2">fewer tools to deal with because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.980" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">already blown one lock down and so yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.139" end="00:25:57.929" style="s2">whatever we need to do now is less</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:26:00.960" style="s2">palatable to us and so what if we had</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.929" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">done you propose this probably first of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.960" end="00:26:08.070" style="s2">May okay most of America had already</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:10.260" style="s2">been in some form of lockdown for five</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.070" end="00:26:12.210" style="s2">or six weeks at that point and you said</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.260" end="00:26:15.240" style="s2">that first of May everyone is already</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.210" end="00:26:18.500" style="s2">exhausted you said what we need is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.240" end="00:26:21.570" style="s2">actual full lockdown for six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.500" end="00:26:23.850" style="s2">everywhere that would clobber this virus</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.570" end="00:26:26.549" style="s2">and then and then we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.850" end="00:26:30.059" style="s2">reopen well it would clobber it if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.549" end="00:26:32.929" style="s2">then followed up properly yes okay so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.059" end="00:26:36.100" style="s2">during those six weeks you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.929" end="00:26:39.100" style="s2">generating tests</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.100" end="00:26:41.290" style="s2">mass-producing tests so that at the end</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.100" end="00:26:43.990" style="s2">of lockdown you could do active tests</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.290" end="00:26:46.140" style="s2">and trace and actually know who was sick</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.990" end="00:26:48.910" style="s2">and who wasn&#39;t and not have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.140" end="00:26:51.160" style="s2">smattering of half-assed test with high</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.910" end="00:26:55.210" style="s2">failure rates and not enough of them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.160" end="00:26:56.380" style="s2">no tracing you know we simply a full</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.210" end="00:26:59.170" style="s2">lockdown wouldn&#39;t have been sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.380" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">but we did not have an appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.170" end="00:27:03.370" style="s2">lockdown and even when you said this I</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:05.230" style="s2">something like May first not here but</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.370" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">you know privately our dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.230" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">my reaction was people won&#39;t do it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:13.300" style="s2">already too late it&#39;s already too late</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:16.330" style="s2">to convince people and that was now over</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.300" end="00:27:19.060" style="s2">two months ago right oh yeah we would</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.330" end="00:27:21.430" style="s2">have been long since passed that if if</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.060" end="00:27:23.560" style="s2">we had done it then yeah so and this I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.430" end="00:27:26.350" style="s2">mean this is exactly a mirror for</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.560" end="00:27:29.530" style="s2">frankly for unity 20/20 just wait until</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.350" end="00:27:31.090" style="s2">2024 when things will be what better you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.530" end="00:27:33.070" style="s2">think it&#39;ll be better by then so I could</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.090" end="00:27:35.080" style="s2">it be better yes it&#39;s already too late</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:37.660" style="s2">but it&#39;s only gonna get more too late</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.080" end="00:27:40.300" style="s2">yes it&#39;s only gonna get more too late is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.660" end="00:27:42.520" style="s2">a I like that formulation I think we did</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.300" end="00:27:44.650" style="s2">adopt it because it&#39;s clumsiness exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.520" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">reflects the clumsiness of our stupid</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.650" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">situation yeah but yeah the fact is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">we need a real lockdown and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:56.440" style="s2">way to do it and well I&#39;m sorry friends</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:27:57.910" style="s2">we gotta I hate to say it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.440" end="00:28:01.780" style="s2">know that we have another choice because</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.910" end="00:28:03.190" style="s2">I mean a this sort of bleeds into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.780" end="00:28:04.750" style="s2">next conversation that we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.190" end="00:28:07.420" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s it we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.750" end="00:28:08.710" style="s2">question about school I mean doing what</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.420" end="00:28:12.220" style="s2">to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.710" end="00:28:15.240" style="s2">upcoming and you know there&#39;s nuance</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.220" end="00:28:18.520" style="s2">here the very young kids seem unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.240" end="00:28:22.420" style="s2">even if they catch it to transmit it so</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.520" end="00:28:25.480" style="s2">there&#39;s talk of letting kids in grade</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.420" end="00:28:27.820" style="s2">school go back but not high school yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.480" end="00:28:29.410" style="s2">they&#39;re I&#39;ve seen some proposals and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.820" end="00:28:30.430" style="s2">these things are changing daily such</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.410" end="00:28:32.050" style="s2">that even what I thought I knew</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.430" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">yesterday I can no longer find online</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.050" end="00:28:38.890" style="s2">but the the conversations in American</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:42.580" style="s2">schools seem to be sort of trending</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.890" end="00:28:44.890" style="s2">towards there have been very few if any</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.580" end="00:28:46.360" style="s2">cases known to be have been transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.890" end="00:28:47.800" style="s2">in elementary school elementary school</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.360" end="00:28:48.870" style="s2">children so therefore don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.800" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">transmit nor</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.870" end="00:28:53.340" style="s2">infected middle schoolers more so high</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:55.230" style="s2">schoolers more yet and so there have</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.340" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">been proposals to do things like totally</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:29:00.030" style="s2">virtual schooling for high schoolers at</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.770" style="s2">least through January 2021 some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.030" end="00:29:03.870" style="s2">hybrid system for middle schoolers you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.770" end="00:29:06.540" style="s2">know two days on every week and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.870" end="00:29:10.470" style="s2">in-person schooling for elementary</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.540" end="00:29:12.840" style="s2">school kids all of which is horrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.470" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">not only horrible horrible but to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:18.870" style="s2">extent that we let some schools reopen</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:20.520" style="s2">we&#39;re playing with fire fire that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.870" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be playing with right we had</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.520" end="00:29:26.580" style="s2">we had choices they are being eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:32.730" style="s2">without our asking them to be eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.580" end="00:29:33.300" style="s2">or inviting it and at some level winter</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.730" end="00:29:36.780" style="s2">is coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.300" end="00:29:38.400" style="s2">I mean it just simply is right so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.780" end="00:29:39.540" style="s2">you know I&#39;m speaking as if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.400" end="00:29:41.130" style="s2">lives in the northern hemisphere which</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.540" end="00:29:43.110" style="s2">almost everyone does but I know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.130" end="00:29:45.179" style="s2">there are some holdouts down there in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.110" end="00:29:48.059" style="s2">Australia but if you&#39;re in New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.179" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">well done I should say well done good</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.059" end="00:29:52.380" style="s2">planning on you yeah well done no no not</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:55.160" style="s2">the people who had chose to live there I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.380" end="00:29:57.660" style="s2">mean the political structure that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.160" end="00:30:00.660" style="s2">demolished Cove at 19 in New Zealand oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.660" end="00:30:03.929" style="s2">well it was not excellent planning for</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.660" end="00:30:05.400" style="s2">everybody on the the islands to be there</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.929" end="00:30:07.080" style="s2">and it was good planning of them to use</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.400" end="00:30:08.490" style="s2">effective governance to me do you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:12.059" style="s2">you&#39;re giving the Kiwis more credit than</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.490" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2">they deserve all right now you&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:17.580" style="s2">because I call them Kiwis Janice we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.900" end="00:30:20.280" style="s2">a new zealand friend she called yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.580" end="00:30:22.260" style="s2">a Kiwi yeah all right but so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.280" end="00:30:24.300" style="s2">thing you&#39;re gonna start playing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.260" end="00:30:26.460" style="s2">game with schools right eh not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.300" end="00:30:31.350" style="s2">in those schools even the grade schools</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.460" end="00:30:33.390" style="s2">is a kid right B okay new petri dish we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.350" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">got kids can the virus figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.390" end="00:30:38.190" style="s2">infect the kids right now again this</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:41.640" style="s2">just occurs to me off the top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.190" end="00:30:43.770" style="s2">but I think a lot of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.640" end="00:30:45.780" style="s2">with this virus would be well explained</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.770" end="00:30:48.690" style="s2">if it had leaked from a laboratory that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.780" end="00:30:50.010" style="s2">was using let&#39;s say human tissues right</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.690" end="00:30:51.900" style="s2">human tissues that have been engineered</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.010" end="00:30:54.150" style="s2">not to hit their hayflick limits that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.900" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">means special human tissues like tumor</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.150" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">tissues right that have dysregulation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:00.690" style="s2">their epigenetic nature which means that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:02.790" style="s2">the virus would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.690" end="00:31:05.310" style="s2">chaotic set of cells and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.790" end="00:31:07.740" style="s2">learning how to infect different organs</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.310" end="00:31:10.590" style="s2">because even if you took a lung cancer</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.740" end="00:31:12.570" style="s2">tissue it might be expressing epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.590" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">phenomena from other tissues like liver</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.570" end="00:31:18.900" style="s2">so one of the things that might be true</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">is you know whose tumors you don&#39;t tend</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.900" end="00:31:24.060" style="s2">to see in laboratories as experimental</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:25.920" style="s2">material I got this one</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.060" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">do ya children children all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.920" end="00:31:29.790" style="s2">goodness yeah so I mean look I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:32.550" style="s2">know how far this goes but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.790" end="00:31:34.380" style="s2">say one possibility is it&#39;s a consistent</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.550" end="00:31:36.890" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t transmit outdoors because</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.380" end="00:31:39.420" style="s2">laboratories are indoors it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.890" end="00:31:43.380" style="s2">transmit to children because the tissues</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.420" end="00:31:46.230" style="s2">in question tend to be adult tissues it</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.380" end="00:31:48.030" style="s2">tends to be you know capable of jumping</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.230" end="00:31:50.460" style="s2">lots of boundaries because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.030" end="00:31:53.580" style="s2">you would train it do and as in a cereal</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.460" end="00:31:55.170" style="s2">passage experiment the sounds</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.580" end="00:31:57.750" style="s2">verification ax stand we would want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.170" end="00:31:59.850" style="s2">you know to test all of these but these</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.750" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">are predictions from the idea that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.850" end="00:32:05.130" style="s2">is a lab there this was lab Jenner they</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.700" end="00:32:07.770" style="s2">are subsidiary hypotheses that the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.130" end="00:32:11.250" style="s2">nature of the epidemiology and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.770" end="00:32:15.330" style="s2">symptomatology is the result of training</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:17.580" style="s2">a virus in a lab both intentionally and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.330" end="00:32:20.910" style="s2">inadvertently because of the way lab</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.580" end="00:32:22.380" style="s2">techniques work so for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.910" end="00:32:23.850" style="s2">are still thinking maybe it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.380" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">matter where it came from because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.850" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">still got to deal with it know it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.400" style="s2">matters a lot where it came from it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:31.650" style="s2">going to evolve differently if it if it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.400" end="00:32:33.420" style="s2">jumped from a bat or a Pangolin that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.650" end="00:32:35.850" style="s2">was than if it was created especially</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.420" end="00:32:37.650" style="s2">from tumor tissues that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.850" end="00:32:40.380" style="s2">hayflick limit switch you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.650" end="00:32:41.460" style="s2">being cells that do not have an endpoint</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.380" end="00:32:44.070" style="s2">that it could just keep replicating</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.460" end="00:32:46.110" style="s2">indefinitely those those cells will act</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.070" end="00:32:48.510" style="s2">differently and therefore viruses that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.110" end="00:32:51.270" style="s2">can be transmitted via those cells will</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.510" end="00:32:53.370" style="s2">act differently than any other naturally</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.270" end="00:32:54.750" style="s2">occurring virus yep and the fact is even</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.370" end="00:32:56.670" style="s2">if this came from the wild if it came</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.750" end="00:32:59.880" style="s2">directly from a bat somehow by some</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.670" end="00:33:01.890" style="s2">means we do not know we don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.880" end="00:33:05.010" style="s2">it did yet and until we know that it did</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.890" end="00:33:06.870" style="s2">you cannot shut down these hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.010" end="00:33:09.750" style="s2">that suggests this may be a central</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.870" end="00:33:11.670" style="s2">player in the epidemiology and the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.750" end="00:33:13.680" style="s2">phenomenology associated with this virus</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.670" end="00:33:15.010" style="s2">so we need to know and if what we prove</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.680" end="00:33:17.380" style="s2">is that actually through some</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.010" end="00:33:19.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t get it came directly from a bat</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.380" end="00:33:24.430" style="s2">great that would be really positive um</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.900" end="00:33:26.770" style="s2">but it&#39;s not looking likely I gotta tell</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.430" end="00:33:29.380" style="s2">you yeah so what do we do is that where</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.770" end="00:33:31.060" style="s2">we&#39;re going next well I think more to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.380" end="00:33:34.210" style="s2">say about school yeah quite quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.060" end="00:33:37.480" style="s2">actually um so our friend Keiko kowambe</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.210" end="00:33:39.220" style="s2">who&#39;s online as on Twitter as Keiko and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.480" end="00:33:41.980" style="s2">Boston for those who are looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.220" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">follow who she just does extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.980" end="00:33:46.330" style="s2">research and unexpected things yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.080" end="00:33:49.390" style="s2">awesome she she is she is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.330" end="00:33:51.340" style="s2">so it&#39;s Keiko in Boston so she pointed</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.390" end="00:33:54.790" style="s2">us to this egregious action that just</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.340" end="00:33:57.130" style="s2">happened in Michigan where even though</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.790" end="00:34:01.300" style="s2">Governor Whitmer I think it is in</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.130" end="00:34:03.910" style="s2">Michigan had declared that what</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.300" end="00:34:06.310" style="s2">probation violations would not result in</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.910" end="00:34:08.050" style="s2">jail time something like this she had</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.310" end="00:34:13.350" style="s2">declared something basically to give a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.050" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">break to both people and potentially the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.350" end="00:34:19.840" style="s2">system during coab in 19 despite that a</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.200" end="00:34:38.590" style="s2">when school transitioned to online in</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.169" end="00:34:40.300" style="s2">March she didn&#39;t do her homework Wow and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.590" end="00:34:42.429" style="s2">she was sent to juvenile detention as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.300" end="00:34:43.929" style="s2">result not doing her homework was a</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.929" end="00:34:49.300" style="s2">declared so Keiko points out in a thread</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.070" end="00:34:52.090" style="s2">about this and there&#39;s a story in</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.090" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">not justice and more to the point though</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.790" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">this so points to the failure virtual</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:32.410" style="s2">schooling and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:36.430" style="s2">of what school is this is it imagines</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.430" end="00:35:40.180" style="s2">that school was about sitting in</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.180" end="00:35:43.930" style="s2">memorization that&#39;s not education it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.310" end="00:35:45.880" style="s2">not education people we have a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.930" end="00:35:48.070" style="s2">say about this in general and in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.880" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">book that we&#39;re writing but I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.070" end="00:35:54.630" style="s2">read two pages from john taylor gatto</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:56.470" style="s2">weapons of mass instruction a 2009 book</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.630" end="00:35:57.970" style="s2">before you do that I have a technical</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.470" end="00:36:01.270" style="s2">question is there a statute of</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.270" end="00:36:04.930" style="s2">because I&#39;m a it&#39;s possible I missed</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.340" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">some assignments yeah yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.930" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">both of our children are in trouble too</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m gonna you&#39;re gonna have to</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:20.050" style="s2">book is extraordinary he&#39;s this this guy</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.869" end="00:36:21.640" style="s2">john taylor gatto one let&#39;s see i did</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.050" end="00:36:24.970" style="s2">not go back and think about his</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.640" end="00:36:26.590" style="s2">biography he&#39;s he&#39;s since died but he</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.820" end="00:36:47.080" style="s2">here let me just one more thing about</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.609" end="00:36:49.780" style="s2">the book though I recommend this book</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.080" end="00:36:53.220" style="s2">very very highly he does unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.780" end="00:36:55.150" style="s2">like Robyn D&#39;Angelo in white fragility</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.220" end="00:36:56.440" style="s2">misunderstand like many good liberals</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.150" end="00:36:57.310" style="s2">with no background in science and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.440" end="00:36:59.140" style="s2">specifically no background in</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.820" end="00:37:03.700" style="s2">understanding of human behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.080" end="00:37:05.020" style="s2">there&#39;s that&#39;s a bit irritating in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:07.230" style="s2">beginning of the book if you do read his</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.020" end="00:37:09.790" style="s2">sort of history of compulsory education</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.230" end="00:37:13.060" style="s2">but other than that I find a little to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.790" end="00:37:14.830" style="s2">disagree with here so he says let me</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.060" end="00:37:17.080" style="s2">tell you a little bit about fat Stanley</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.830" end="00:37:19.450" style="s2">whose path crossed mine when he was 13</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.080" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">Stanley onek only came to class one or</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.450" end="00:37:21.970" style="s2">two days a month and I knew that sooner</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:24.369" style="s2">or later he would be caught in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.970" end="00:37:25.510" style="s2">truancy net and prosecuted I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.369" end="00:37:26.890" style="s2">Stanley not least because he never</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.510" end="00:37:28.510" style="s2">whined when other kids bothered him</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:29.710" style="s2">because he was fat he simply punched</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.510" end="00:37:32.950" style="s2">them so hard in the head nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.710" end="00:37:34.210" style="s2">bothered Stanley a second time I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.950" end="00:37:36.540" style="s2">spare him the grim experience of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.210" end="00:37:40.890" style="s2">becoming a social service case</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.540" end="00:37:42.359" style="s2">as grace became a social service case so</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.890" end="00:37:44.820" style="s2">I asked him one day what he did on all</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.359" end="00:37:46.770" style="s2">those absences what he said changed my</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.820" end="00:37:49.560" style="s2">life I never saw school the same way</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.770" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">after Stanley spoke it seems Stanley had</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.560" end="00:37:52.770" style="s2">five outs and uncles all in business for</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:55.010" style="s2">themselves before the age of twenty-one</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.770" end="00:37:57.390" style="s2">his aim was to follow in their footsteps</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.010" end="00:37:59.490" style="s2">even at 13 he had been made aware of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.390" end="00:38:00.690" style="s2">times winged chariot hurrying near that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.490" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">he had only eight years to make the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.690" end="00:38:04.650" style="s2">miracle of an independent livelihood one</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:06.210" style="s2">of the relatives was a florist when a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.650" end="00:38:07.980" style="s2">builder of unfinished furniture when a</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.530" end="00:38:13.410" style="s2">Stanley cut school to work without pay</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.910" end="00:38:14.730" style="s2">for each of these relatives bartering</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.410" end="00:38:16.650" style="s2">labor in exchange for learning the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.730" end="00:38:17.880" style="s2">businesses and a whole lot more working</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.650" end="00:38:19.140" style="s2">in the company of men and women who</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.880" end="00:38:21.630" style="s2">cared for him much more than any</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.140" end="00:38:22.920" style="s2">professional stranger would have it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.630" end="00:38:24.390" style="s2">a better educational package than</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.920" end="00:38:27.240" style="s2">whatever he missed cutting school hands</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.390" end="00:38:28.950" style="s2">down as he put it to me man-to-man quote</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.240" end="00:38:30.329" style="s2">this way I get a chance to see on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.950" end="00:38:31.500" style="s2">different businesses work you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.329" end="00:38:33.180" style="s2">what books I have to read and I&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.500" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">them but I don&#39;t have time to waste in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.180" end="00:38:37.890" style="s2">school unless I want to end up like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:39.390" style="s2">working for somebody else when I heard</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.890" end="00:38:41.160" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t keep him locked up in</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.390" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">good conscience besides his mother</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.160" end="00:38:44.430" style="s2">agreed with Stanley so I began to cover</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:46.380" style="s2">for him</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.430" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">logging him present when he was marking</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.380" end="00:38:50.040" style="s2">floral bouquets or building furniture</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">none of his other teachers ever asked I</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.040" end="00:38:53.400" style="s2">think they were glad to be rid of him to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">illustrate the powerful energies at work</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.400" end="00:38:57.390" style="s2">under his fat deceptively cheerful</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:59.400" style="s2">exterior Stanley crossed his T&#39;s with a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.390" end="00:39:01.349" style="s2">pointed spear formation on a simple line</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.400" end="00:39:02.849" style="s2">right then and there I adapted his T</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.349" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">crosses my own to remind me what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.849" end="00:39:07.619" style="s2">learned from a truant that day a big</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.910" end="00:39:09.210" style="s2">secret of bulk process schooling is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.619" end="00:39:11.819" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t teach the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.210" end="00:39:13.020" style="s2">children learn a bigger secret is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.819" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">it isn&#39;t supposed to teach self</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.020" end="00:39:15.960" style="s2">direction at all Stanley style is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">verboten</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.960" end="00:39:19.319" style="s2">school is about learning to wait your</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">turn however long it takes to come if</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.319" end="00:39:23.220" style="s2">ever and how to submit with a show of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:24.690" style="s2">enthusiasm to the judgment of strangers</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.010" end="00:39:32.220" style="s2">and its relentless need to rank everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.510" end="00:39:33.690" style="s2">on a scale of winners and losers like</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.690" end="00:39:37.050" style="s2">school teaches about your place in the</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.050" end="00:39:42.390" style="s2">of us work in classrooms isn&#39;t important</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.790" end="00:40:09.750" style="s2">for a long time I&#39;m tempted to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.560" end="00:40:11.130" style="s2">forever growth and self mastery are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.750" end="00:40:13.290" style="s2">reserved for those who vigorously</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.290" end="00:41:16.220" style="s2">I mean you know how much I resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:19.260" style="s2">with that I will say in my case the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.220" end="00:41:21.060" style="s2">teachers and professors who figured out</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.260" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">a way to cover for me and break the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.060" end="00:41:24.600" style="s2">rules for me we&#39;re the ones that were</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.170" end="00:42:23.710" style="s2">this year and he said is this the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.730" end="00:42:26.410" style="s2">meeting I mean that was classic yep but</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.710" end="00:42:28.540" style="s2">anyway you know less people</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.410" end="00:42:30.490" style="s2">misunderstand the story it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.540" end="00:42:33.460" style="s2">you weren&#39;t constantly engaging with him</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.490" end="00:42:35.410" style="s2">and with your peers our colleagues and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.460" end="00:42:37.630" style="s2">the other faculty and all of us you just</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.410" end="00:42:39.460" style="s2">you didn&#39;t you didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.630" end="00:42:40.840" style="s2">by for him you didn&#39;t do it formulaic</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.460" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">Lee I couldn&#39;t do it as you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.840" end="00:42:43.600" style="s2">supposed to I didn&#39;t do it as I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:45.010" style="s2">supposed to I didn&#39;t even know you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.600" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2">my dissertation didn&#39;t end up on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.010" end="00:42:47.980" style="s2">topic I was supposed to be working on</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">but it did end I know bats at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.980" end="00:42:53.110" style="s2">important yeah the bats don&#39;t show up in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">it but um but you know yeah you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.110" end="00:42:56.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:58.660" style="s2">useful it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.620" end="00:43:00.700" style="s2">the the regular rules weren&#39;t gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.660" end="00:43:02.590" style="s2">and he knew that he appreciated you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.700" end="00:43:05.350" style="s2">although he was very good at the rules</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.590" end="00:43:07.120" style="s2">in a way that I never could have been he</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.350" end="00:43:09.250" style="s2">also just spotted that some people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.120" end="00:43:12.280" style="s2">fit them and it&#39;s worth bending rules</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.250" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">for those people sometimes so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.280" end="00:43:16.030" style="s2">will say I mean this is probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:19.170" style="s2">place but so this was at University of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.030" end="00:43:22.630" style="s2">Michigan where we both got our PhDs and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.170" end="00:43:24.610" style="s2">you know I had always had a lovely time</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.630" end="00:43:26.590" style="s2">in school but I didn&#39;t have any biology</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.610" end="00:43:29.020" style="s2">background until we met Bob Trevor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.590" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">late in college whereas you had been</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.020" end="00:43:33.880" style="s2">doing biology since you could walk</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:35.350" style="s2">basically but had always had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.880" end="00:43:38.050" style="s2">completely lousy time in school and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.350" end="00:43:41.140" style="s2">basically needed nothing more than to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.050" end="00:43:43.480" style="s2">left alone by it and so you know we had</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.140" end="00:43:45.940" style="s2">very different experiences walking into</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.480" end="00:43:48.250" style="s2">that system and I&#39;m you know I I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.940" end="00:43:51.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen evidence that the University</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.250" end="00:43:54.670" style="s2">of Michigan which was really the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.810" end="00:43:56.890" style="s2">public the the first public university</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.670" end="00:43:58.510" style="s2">system in the United States that try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.890" end="00:44:01.750" style="s2">become a premier and you know an elite</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.510" end="00:44:03.940" style="s2">university system in it and it did but</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.750" end="00:44:05.860" style="s2">they it managed at least that department</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.940" end="00:44:08.890" style="s2">of biology then and the University of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.860" end="00:44:11.230" style="s2">Michigan Museum zoology managed to find</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.890" end="00:44:14.050" style="s2">ways to laud both of us with our very</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.230" end="00:44:15.880" style="s2">different approaches to and backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.050" end="00:44:16.349" style="s2">and skill sets and all of this you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.880" end="00:44:19.829" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.349" end="00:44:21.479" style="s2">we both won each of us won different of</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.829" end="00:44:23.249" style="s2">their highest awards that they had to</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.479" end="00:44:24.630" style="s2">offer for the work that we did there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.249" end="00:44:27.180" style="s2">you know to their credit that an</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.630" end="00:44:29.369" style="s2">institution could see both someone</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.180" end="00:44:32.069" style="s2">coming in with almost no background who</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.369" end="00:44:34.380" style="s2">needed to self teach and teach on and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.069" end="00:44:37.229" style="s2">learn on the fly but who but who loved</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.380" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">school and someone who had tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.229" end="00:44:42.989" style="s2">background but no ability to play by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:45.329" style="s2">rules and you were always mistaken for</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.989" end="00:44:47.400" style="s2">someone who refused to play by the rules</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.329" end="00:44:49.979" style="s2">and to some degree that&#39;s true but to</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.400" end="00:44:52.619" style="s2">some degree it was also just guys I I</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.979" end="00:44:54.599" style="s2">just can&#39;t do this right the rules don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.619" end="00:44:56.369" style="s2">make sense yeah you know they do make</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.599" end="00:44:58.229" style="s2">sense for this kind of regimented</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.369" end="00:45:01.499" style="s2">training thing it&#39;s not how you train</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.229" end="00:45:04.499" style="s2">people to discover new stuff and so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.499" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">know that&#39;s I mean the people who broke</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.499" end="00:45:08.729" style="s2">the rules on my behalf or bent them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">not like they weren&#39;t frustrated with me</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.729" end="00:45:12.890" style="s2">right but they also we&#39;re all frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.039" end="00:45:19.259" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve begun to detect that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.430" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s a point is look</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.259" end="00:45:24.119" style="s2">what is the objective of the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:26.369" style="s2">right and you know yeah you know yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.119" end="00:45:29.329" style="s2">discredit but not just decorate know it</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.369" end="00:45:32.130" style="s2">says so too many people&#39;s credit there</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.329" end="00:45:33.809" style="s2">they work constantly asking themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.130" end="00:45:36.719" style="s2">what is the point of this exercise and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.809" end="00:45:38.130" style="s2">that is like why how are we having this</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.719" end="00:45:40.769" style="s2">conversation about schooling for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.130" end="00:45:43.079" style="s2">fall fall 2020 in the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.769" end="00:45:44.729" style="s2">no one appears to be asking what is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.079" end="00:45:47.880" style="s2">point of this exercise right bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.729" end="00:45:49.619" style="s2">children are not brains in jars they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.880" end="00:45:52.380" style="s2">not brains in jars we used to hear this</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.619" end="00:45:54.029" style="s2">from our idiot colleagues at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.380" end="00:45:56.460" style="s2">the faculty colleagues that we had who</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.029" end="00:45:58.229" style="s2">basically said I don&#39;t care who they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.460" end="00:45:59.999" style="s2">what they think when they&#39;re outside of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.229" end="00:46:01.950" style="s2">school exactly what John Taylor Gatto is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.999" end="00:46:03.509" style="s2">complaining about right oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.950" end="00:46:05.670" style="s2">they&#39;re these students are effectively</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.509" end="00:46:07.769" style="s2">brains in charge no they&#39;re not no one</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.670" end="00:46:08.789" style="s2">is we live in meatspace and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.769" end="00:46:12.779" style="s2">than living in meatspace</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.789" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">we we are interfacing with the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.779" end="00:46:18.299" style="s2">through our senses and through hearing</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:21.529" style="s2">and smell and and an audition and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.299" end="00:46:24.869" style="s2">through touch and you can&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.529" end="00:46:26.789" style="s2">entirely through a screen yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.869" end="00:46:28.769" style="s2">can&#39;t do it do you we also just</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.789" end="00:46:29.860" style="s2">completely bought the motivational</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.769" end="00:46:32.800" style="s2">aspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.860" end="00:46:34.840" style="s2">so you know the the reason I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.800" end="00:46:37.870" style="s2">the way I did was because school</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.840" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">provides no useful model for motivation</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.870" end="00:46:42.850" style="s2">you found self motivation because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:45.490" style="s2">were good at the job in school it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.850" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">what you were about but the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.490" end="00:46:49.360" style="s2">you could get a reward from school for</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:50.590" style="s2">learning things that were totally worth</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.360" end="00:46:54.130" style="s2">learning uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.590" end="00:46:56.380" style="s2">made it functional motivationally for me</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.130" end="00:46:57.850" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t able to get that so my</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.380" end="00:47:00.550" style="s2">experience of school is just constantly</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.850" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">being slapped by it now that wrecks some</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.550" end="00:47:04.780" style="s2">people in my case I was able to find</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">other things that were rewarding enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.780" end="00:47:08.830" style="s2">to get me to do them that were actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:10.090" style="s2">educational but it didn&#39;t fit you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.830" end="00:47:11.350" style="s2">school kept asking well how are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.090" end="00:47:12.940" style="s2">doing on the assignment and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.350" end="00:47:16.090" style="s2">was well I&#39;m not doing the assignment</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.940" end="00:47:19.090" style="s2">and so the answer is failure dumb track</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.090" end="00:47:21.370" style="s2">all that stuff and and and exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.090" end="00:47:24.070" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not the school is carrot</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.370" end="00:47:26.440" style="s2">and stick model but in your case the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.070" end="00:47:28.060" style="s2">stick didn&#39;t kill you and in my case the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.440" end="00:47:30.730" style="s2">carrot wasn&#39;t the reward I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.060" end="00:47:33.370" style="s2">for the carrot that I that I got the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.730" end="00:47:36.550" style="s2">actual reward was oh I got whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.370" end="00:47:38.470" style="s2">opposite of dumb tracking is and I got</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.550" end="00:47:40.540" style="s2">into classes that were amazing you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.470" end="00:47:42.910" style="s2">why do I have this pile of books from</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.540" end="00:47:44.740" style="s2">tenth grade where I was reading Mao and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.910" end="00:47:47.140" style="s2">Lenin and Marx and Hobbes and Locke and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.740" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">Rousseau and all of this and you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.140" end="00:47:50.290" style="s2">you know people who were dumb tracked</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:51.910" style="s2">we&#39;re being forced to learn what a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.290" end="00:47:53.980" style="s2">preposition was does it really matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.910" end="00:47:56.410" style="s2">what a preposition is I never had to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.980" end="00:47:59.560" style="s2">that yeah and the funny of the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.410" end="00:48:02.230" style="s2">that I got exposed to the great ideas</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.560" end="00:48:05.380" style="s2">and terrible ideas of the great thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.230" end="00:48:07.690" style="s2">throughout history while people who were</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.380" end="00:48:10.540" style="s2">just as capable were being forced to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.690" end="00:48:12.370" style="s2">rote memorized rules of grammar which of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.540" end="00:48:14.590" style="s2">course you&#39;re going to hate school if</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.370" end="00:48:17.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re being exposed to so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.590" end="00:48:20.050" style="s2">want to give a plug to the black</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.050" end="00:48:24.040" style="s2">come out on the Dark Horse podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.330" end="00:48:26.470" style="s2">the reason I want to do that here is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.040" end="00:48:28.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a probably the most painful</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.470" end="00:48:29.650" style="s2">moment in the whole thing for me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.300" end="00:48:31.690" style="s2">the only painful moment in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.650" end="00:48:34.300" style="s2">thing for me is we were having an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.690" end="00:48:36.850" style="s2">argument about reparations and the panel</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.300" end="00:48:38.500" style="s2">did not agree which was expected there</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.850" end="00:48:43.140" style="s2">all publicly in different places on on</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.500" end="00:48:45.210" style="s2">this issue and my point was I</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.140" end="00:48:47.099" style="s2">think reparations is a good idea at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.210" end="00:48:49.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that remedy will work but</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.099" end="00:48:50.910" style="s2">I think a remedy is justified and I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.230" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">arguing that the remedy was investment</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.910" end="00:48:55.619" style="s2">in communities and in defense of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:58.259" style="s2">argument I said something about tax</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.619" end="00:48:59.880" style="s2">bases telling you what kind of school</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.259" end="00:49:01.289" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have if you have a wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.880" end="00:49:02.849" style="s2">neighborhood with a big tax base you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.289" end="00:49:04.259" style="s2">have a good school and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.849" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">poor neighborhood you&#39;ll have a bad one</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.259" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">and I said we know how to make a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:12.150" style="s2">school and I heard myself say it and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">thought what the hell did I just say I</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.150" end="00:49:15.989" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that we can we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:17.430" style="s2">make a better school right we know how</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.989" end="00:49:19.049" style="s2">to make a worse school but we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.430" end="00:49:21.960" style="s2">how to make a good school and Camille</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.049" end="00:49:22.980" style="s2">foster of course caught me out on this</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.960" end="00:49:24.150" style="s2">and he&#39;s like I don&#39;t think we do know</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.980" end="00:49:25.950" style="s2">how to make a good school and it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.150" end="00:49:28.859" style="s2">like oh man I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.950" end="00:49:32.730" style="s2">defending our the nature of our schools</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.859" end="00:49:35.069" style="s2">so we we know how to be good educators</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.730" end="00:49:36.630" style="s2">and we know therefore that it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.069" end="00:49:39.480" style="s2">possible for individuals to be good</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.630" end="00:49:42.059" style="s2">educators but that does not mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.480" end="00:49:44.299" style="s2">know how to do it system whine yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.059" end="00:49:47.789" style="s2">think what I mean is something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.299" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">there is no excuse for us not to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.789" end="00:49:51.599" style="s2">how to make a good school it&#39;s a totally</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:53.579" style="s2">solving a problem if you set out the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.599" end="00:49:56.039" style="s2">right objectives and then figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.579" end="00:49:57.480" style="s2">what works to meet them and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.039" end="00:50:00.210" style="s2">and I have worked on an educational</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.480" end="00:50:04.460" style="s2">project based on our 15 years of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.210" end="00:50:06.569" style="s2">experience at Evergreen and what we</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.460" end="00:50:09.769" style="s2">concluded is that school should look</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.569" end="00:50:12.150" style="s2">like you know exercises and games and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.769" end="00:50:13.890" style="s2">experiences that you don&#39;t even doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.150" end="00:50:15.450" style="s2">feel like school things that teach to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.890" end="00:50:17.400" style="s2">you by virtually the fact that you want</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.450" end="00:50:19.019" style="s2">to do them because they&#39;re fun right</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.400" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what school should look like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.019" end="00:50:24.509" style="s2">only argument for school should include</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:26.970" style="s2">campfires school is a campfire extended</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.509" end="00:50:30.359" style="s2">to a bunch of other realms so you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.970" end="00:50:32.670" style="s2">the only excuse for having people sit in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.359" end="00:50:35.609" style="s2">chairs and face forward to hear somebody</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.670" end="00:50:37.049" style="s2">talk and write the only excuse for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.609" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">is that it&#39;s economically efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.049" end="00:50:40.859" style="s2">the fact is it&#39;s penny wise pound</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:43.279" style="s2">foolish not to put together awesome</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.859" end="00:50:45.539" style="s2">schools that make your population</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.279" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">incredibly smart because really what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.539" end="00:50:48.509" style="s2">takes is just a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:49.950" style="s2">environment that reinforces that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.509" end="00:50:51.660" style="s2">that&#39;s what smart is no it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.950" end="00:50:53.400" style="s2">educational manifestation of Taylorism</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.660" end="00:50:55.109" style="s2">it&#39;s how do you turn the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.400" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">Revolution and the need for factory</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.109" end="00:50:59.460" style="s2">workers into the production</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:03.809" style="s2">of a population that is willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.460" end="00:51:07.170" style="s2">that work yeah so I love John Taylor</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.809" end="00:51:09.630" style="s2">Gatto um he reminds me that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.170" end="00:51:11.759" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the let&#39;s burn it down camp</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.630" end="00:51:13.740" style="s2">when it comes to school and school is</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.759" end="00:51:15.240" style="s2">great camp and he&#39;s from the let&#39;s burn</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.740" end="00:51:20.490" style="s2">it down but only after we get everybody</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.240" end="00:51:21.809" style="s2">out of it yeah yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.490" end="00:51:26.430" style="s2">I guess just one more thing that needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.809" end="00:51:28.680" style="s2">to be said about school is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.430" end="00:51:31.529" style="s2">prospect of schools remaining closed</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.680" end="00:51:34.920" style="s2">this fall especially if that includes</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.529" end="00:51:39.480" style="s2">elementary school kids who are the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.920" end="00:51:43.319" style="s2">at risk at home if they have bad home</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.480" end="00:51:45.569" style="s2">lives means that some children may not</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.319" end="00:51:48.569" style="s2">have an adult have had an adult eye on</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.569" end="00:51:53.339" style="s2">them outside of their family for closing</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.569" end="00:51:56.220" style="s2">in on a year and that the number of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.339" end="00:51:58.859" style="s2">cases of abuse and worse are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.220" end="00:52:01.380" style="s2">skyrocket sky rock for lots of because</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.859" end="00:52:04.769" style="s2">the adults are more stressed the kids</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.380" end="00:52:09.089" style="s2">won&#39;t have eyes on them yeah all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.769" end="00:52:12.239" style="s2">of reasons so that is a huge danger one</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.089" end="00:52:15.690" style="s2">of one of many in this case so I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.239" end="00:52:17.009" style="s2">to just lay out the basics of what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.690" end="00:52:19.529" style="s2">ought to be doing to get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.009" end="00:52:21.450" style="s2">pickles and I actually think that school</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.529" end="00:52:23.220" style="s2">is the thing that we should be shooting</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.450" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">for we should be shooting to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.220" end="00:52:27.989" style="s2">situation where we can afford to open up</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:32.660" style="s2">school on the far side of this okay and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.989" end="00:52:35.910" style="s2">so I mean it&#39;s very simple you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.660" end="00:52:39.180" style="s2">tell us that we&#39;re gonna lock down at</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.910" end="00:52:41.579" style="s2">the maximum possible level for something</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.180" end="00:52:42.989" style="s2">like six weeks right now obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.579" end="00:52:45.660" style="s2">can&#39;t be a hundred percent you have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.989" end="00:52:48.509" style="s2">be able to go to the hospital but by and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.660" end="00:52:50.099" style="s2">large if we had enough warning people</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.509" end="00:52:51.960" style="s2">could stock up whatever financial</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.099" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">resources were necessary in order to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.960" end="00:52:56.460" style="s2">allow people to stock up could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:59.190" style="s2">generated and then it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.460" end="00:53:01.380" style="s2">you know if you have spent time at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.190" end="00:53:03.779" style="s2">beach you hold your breath and you go</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.380" end="00:53:08.009" style="s2">under the wave right six weeks or</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.779" end="00:53:09.970" style="s2">something of the maximum conceivable the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.009" end="00:53:13.300" style="s2">maximum plausible locked</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.970" end="00:53:16.510" style="s2">that causes the virus to bounce whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.300" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">routes it has and burn itself out for</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.510" end="00:53:20.080" style="s2">the most part won&#39;t be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:22.810" style="s2">but it will be close right and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.080" end="00:53:28.660" style="s2">intense testing and tracing on the far</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.810" end="00:53:32.830" style="s2">end with with dealing with flare ups as</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.660" end="00:53:34.930" style="s2">spot fires basically and I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.830" end="00:53:37.330" style="s2">this can&#39;t be done at a national level</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.930" end="00:53:40.090" style="s2">for some reason and frankly it was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.330" end="00:53:41.470" style="s2">right thing to do months ago and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.090" end="00:53:43.810" style="s2">remains the right thing to do even</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.470" end="00:53:46.090" style="s2">though it&#39;s now harder then it is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.810" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">inconceivable to me at least that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.090" end="00:53:50.619" style="s2">individual states could decide to solve</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:52.300" style="s2">their problem and the difficulty with</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.619" end="00:53:54.609" style="s2">that is then they have to police their</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.300" end="00:53:56.830" style="s2">borders right and that may not even be</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.609" end="00:53:58.900" style="s2">constitutional because the nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.830" end="00:54:01.570" style="s2">Federation is that citizens can move</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.900" end="00:54:03.760" style="s2">freely between the states but at some</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.570" end="00:54:06.580" style="s2">level if this is an epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.760" end="00:54:08.349" style="s2">crisis just the same way that crises</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.580" end="00:54:09.790" style="s2">result in a modification of the way we</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.349" end="00:54:11.890" style="s2">see your constitutional rights in</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.790" end="00:54:13.570" style="s2">general we might have to do something in</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.890" end="00:54:15.220" style="s2">a state that doesn&#39;t want to be dragged</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.570" end="00:54:17.560" style="s2">down by a country that can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.220" end="00:54:19.210" style="s2">how to do a lockdown might decide you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.560" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2">know what we&#39;re gonna solve it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.210" end="00:54:26.200" style="s2">Montana right we&#39;re gonna solve it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:29.980" style="s2">Oregon and then I mean imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.200" end="00:54:31.780" style="s2">following thing look folks on the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.980" end="00:54:33.160" style="s2">typically are the ones advocating the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.780" end="00:54:35.050" style="s2">laboratory of the states is this great</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.160" end="00:54:37.420" style="s2">idea I&#39;m often skeptical of it because</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.050" end="00:54:38.920" style="s2">of the bad game theory but imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.420" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">good game theory the race to the top</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.920" end="00:54:43.630" style="s2">that emerges of a state figures out how</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.180" end="00:55:04.540" style="s2">catastrophe with respect to things like</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.770" end="00:55:06.040" style="s2">taxes where we race to the bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.540" end="00:55:08.260" style="s2">nobody can collect the taxes to do the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.040" end="00:55:09.580" style="s2">basic stuff but in this case it could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.260" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">race to the top and we should seriously</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.580" end="00:55:18.760" style="s2">consider it alright this is a very long</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:21.809" style="s2">pause yeah no I we&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.760" end="00:55:24.630" style="s2">and what I said earlier is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.809" end="00:55:27.180" style="s2">is true it&#39;s if it was too late then</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.630" end="00:55:29.279" style="s2">it&#39;s even more too late now</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.180" end="00:55:31.469" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s also true that I have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.279" end="00:55:34.259" style="s2">extraordinarily human reaction of oh my</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.469" end="00:55:34.920" style="s2">god no like we can&#39;t but I also know</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.259" end="00:55:38.430" style="s2">that we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.920" end="00:55:40.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s mitigating my reaction which</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.430" end="00:55:42.119" style="s2">is awful because the mitigation of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.199" end="00:55:45.390" style="s2">reaction is just an understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.119" end="00:55:48.769" style="s2">this is like politically not viable well</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.390" end="00:55:51.689" style="s2">so here&#39;s the thing right it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.769" end="00:55:58.199" style="s2">summer in the in the northern hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.689" end="00:55:59.939" style="s2">and lockdown could mean go outside right</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.199" end="00:56:02.339" style="s2">lockdown doesn&#39;t have to mean lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.939" end="00:56:04.289" style="s2">in the winter look I think we got away</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.339" end="00:56:06.420" style="s2">with something at the tail end of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.289" end="00:56:08.729" style="s2">last cold season I guess I&#39;m so if</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.420" end="00:56:10.949" style="s2">lockdown we&#39;re smarter yeah right so you</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.689" end="00:57:10.619" style="s2">they opened up and things went haywire</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.369" end="00:57:13.349" style="s2">but they the entire thing was just this</p>

<p begin="01:00:03.900" end="01:00:08.070" style="s2">my father voted for Reagan twice at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.390" end="01:00:12.210" style="s2">end of his life he voted for Obama twice</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.070" end="01:00:14.370" style="s2">and part of that was that he actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.210" end="01:00:16.740" style="s2">you know he wasn&#39;t a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.370" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">through and through he was really a</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.740" end="01:00:22.020" style="s2">progressive Republican and part of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:25.800" style="s2">is that you know we you and I Brett got</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.020" end="01:00:28.350" style="s2">together so young under 20 and that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.800" end="01:00:31.830" style="s2">and I and my father spent a lot of late</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.350" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">evenings with bottles of wine talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.830" end="01:00:38.520" style="s2">and and he moved you know he shifted</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:41.640" style="s2">some he didn&#39;t he did not he you know he</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.140" end="01:00:48.660" style="s2">but we were coming from roughly the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.660" end="01:00:53.010" style="s2">same place and he dismissed it at first</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.660" end="01:00:54.900" style="s2">and he definitely was one over to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.010" end="01:00:56.820" style="s2">idea that we were on about something and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.900" end="01:00:58.410" style="s2">he also convinced us of a fair number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.820" end="01:01:02.130" style="s2">things so I think there was a way in</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.410" end="01:01:03.780" style="s2">which he had a kind of right of center</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.130" end="01:01:06.390" style="s2">perspective that was born of a healthy</p>

<p begin="01:01:54.570" end="01:01:58.710" style="s2">large part because of my father growing</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.790" end="01:01:59.740" style="s2">up in that milieu seeing a functional</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.950" end="01:02:17.980" style="s2">well then we need to reduce regulations</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.990" end="01:02:23.500" style="s2">side of things yeah he also just in his</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.980" end="01:02:26.590" style="s2">professional life was I mean had no</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.500" end="01:02:28.630" style="s2">prejudice right he was a mentor to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.590" end="01:02:30.910" style="s2">people in computer science who were</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.630" end="01:02:32.470" style="s2">coding for the various projects that he</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.910" end="01:02:33.730" style="s2">worked on and it was clear he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.470" end="01:02:36.369" style="s2">care if you were woman or you&#39;re black</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.730" end="01:02:37.960" style="s2">or didn&#39;t matter he just he took all</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.369" end="01:02:39.369" style="s2">comers and it&#39;s so interesting you say</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.960" end="01:02:40.840" style="s2">that because in none of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.369" end="01:02:42.130" style="s2">conversation obviously I knew him so I</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.840" end="01:02:43.480" style="s2">know that to be true but didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.130" end="01:02:46.270" style="s2">occur to me that people would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.480" end="01:02:49.390" style="s2">listening to this thinking as a publican</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.270" end="01:02:51.070" style="s2">was probably racist like like no but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.390" end="01:02:54.070" style="s2">most people who are conservatives or</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.070" end="01:02:56.500" style="s2">Republicans art well I agree but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.070" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">I&#39;m stepping it back even a look lots of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.500" end="01:03:00.550" style="s2">people who I wouldn&#39;t call racist have</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:02.200" style="s2">some prejudice they prejudge yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.550" end="01:03:04.450" style="s2">and the basis of something any computer</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.200" end="01:03:06.700" style="s2">science especially likely just well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.450" end="01:03:11.310" style="s2">father was yeah especially likely as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.700" end="01:03:12.720" style="s2">matter of sex and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.310" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">you&#39;re the product of his not having</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.720" end="01:03:17.040" style="s2">that prejudice right right because the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">point was he you know it&#39;s not like he</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.040" end="01:03:21.480" style="s2">was indifferent to the fact that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:22.410" style="s2">were a girl but he certainly it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.480" end="01:03:24.120" style="s2">change how he approached you</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.410" end="01:03:25.740" style="s2">intellectually I had math brain he had</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.120" end="01:03:28.290" style="s2">math brain and he taught me everything</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.740" end="01:03:30.060" style="s2">sixth to calculus and you know we do my</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.290" end="01:03:32.820" style="s2">elementary school homework and binary on</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.060" end="01:03:35.370" style="s2">occasion so no didn&#39;t and I think you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.820" end="01:03:38.340" style="s2">know I think you took on what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.370" end="01:03:39.900" style="s2">traditionally a more male mindset and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.340" end="01:03:42.540" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.900" end="01:03:43.980" style="s2">that you do stuff like this so well is</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.540" end="01:03:46.050" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually capable of seeing</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.980" end="01:03:48.060" style="s2">things from different perspectives that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.050" end="01:03:49.830" style="s2">are often you know relegated to one side</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.060" end="01:03:52.950" style="s2">of that line or the other but that was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.830" end="01:03:56.100" style="s2">set of lessons largely instantiated in</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.950" end="01:04:00.060" style="s2">and by my father yep yeah yeah it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.100" end="01:04:01.350" style="s2">yeah so I bring him up in part because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.060" end="01:04:04.950" style="s2">think you know I&#39;d ever thought to call</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.350" end="01:04:07.050" style="s2">him a progressive Republican but I would</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.950" end="01:04:09.030" style="s2">just love to be hearing what he is</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.050" end="01:04:10.170" style="s2">thinking about this moment and you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.030" end="01:04:12.300" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t have voted for Trump I know</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.170" end="01:04:14.930" style="s2">that yeah um what would he be doing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.300" end="01:04:18.180" style="s2">right now you know I think he would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.930" end="01:04:20.670" style="s2">excited about but skeptical of you ready</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.180" end="01:04:23.490" style="s2">2020 yeah what is a wise position yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.670" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">you know I&#39;m it would be great if we had</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.490" end="01:04:26.790" style="s2">him to bounce this stuff off of because</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:29.970" style="s2">he would no doubt have interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.790" end="01:04:31.350" style="s2">insights about it so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.970" end="01:04:33.630" style="s2">progressive Republican is a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.350" end="01:04:35.880" style="s2">description you know and maybe a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.630" end="01:04:39.690" style="s2">head ahead of his time in that regard</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.880" end="01:04:41.040" style="s2">yeah so is that it</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.690" end="01:04:44.940" style="s2">do you want to say something about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.040" end="01:04:46.710" style="s2">one last item before we it&#39;s so timely</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.940" end="01:04:50.220" style="s2">yeah I think it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.710" end="01:04:54.060" style="s2">so hey Zach do you want to put up Barry</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.220" end="01:04:56.100" style="s2">Weiss&#39;s better of resignation so well</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.060" end="01:05:00.050" style="s2">zach is doing that we have two</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.100" end="01:05:03.150" style="s2">announcements of of big names leaving</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.050" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">mainstream media this week we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.150" end="01:05:07.230" style="s2">Andrew Sullivan leaving the New York New</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:09.810" style="s2">York magazine</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.230" end="01:05:11.370" style="s2">I think it&#39;s called although he will</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.810" end="01:05:12.780" style="s2">explore some of his reasons for that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.370" end="01:05:15.210" style="s2">this Friday which I guess is gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.780" end="01:05:16.740" style="s2">his last day and then Barry Weiss made</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.210" end="01:05:19.350" style="s2">public her resignation letter from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.740" end="01:05:21.180" style="s2">New York Times today and this is on her</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.350" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">website and we&#39;ll post that link as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.180" end="01:05:24.820" style="s2">so it&#39;s an extraordinary letter it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:26.170" style="s2">extraordinary letter</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.820" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">I want to put it in a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.170" end="01:05:31.540" style="s2">context though the thing is okay so</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:35.800" style="s2">Barry Weiss is a somewhat controversial</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.540" end="01:05:37.360" style="s2">person at the New York Times but she has</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.800" end="01:05:40.360" style="s2">left the New York Times and what she</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.360" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">does in her letter of resignation if she</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.360" end="01:05:46.920" style="s2">describes the internal environment at</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:48.700" style="s2">the Times right the ways in which her</p>

<p begin="01:05:48.700" end="01:05:56.700" style="s2">journalistically that once existed has</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.940" end="01:05:59.980" style="s2">been backed off by basically a</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.700" end="01:06:03.370" style="s2">vindictive mob inside the times that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.980" end="01:06:07.360" style="s2">demonizes people publicly on their slack</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.370" end="01:06:10.030" style="s2">channels and the like and the mob which</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.360" end="01:06:12.070" style="s2">she believes to be a minority a minority</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.030" end="01:06:14.050" style="s2">of the people yes because there&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.070" end="01:06:15.430" style="s2">course the requisite culture of fear</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.050" end="01:06:17.080" style="s2">that goes along with this so you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.430" end="01:06:18.460" style="s2">small number of very aggressive people</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.080" end="01:06:20.920" style="s2">you have a large number of people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.460" end="01:06:23.650" style="s2">can&#39;t say what they actually think it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.920" end="01:06:26.440" style="s2">has effectively toppled The Times The</p>

<p begin="01:06:28.510" end="01:06:33.600" style="s2">that is broadcasting a particular</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.630" end="01:06:42.460" style="s2">know the problem is not only does she</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.020" end="01:06:44.200" style="s2">give us a window into what&#39;s going on at</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.460" end="01:06:47.620" style="s2">the New York Times but we can infer from</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.200" end="01:06:51.190" style="s2">what Matt Taibbi has said about what was</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.620" end="01:06:53.050" style="s2">going on in other news rooms we can see</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.190" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">by Andrew Sullivan and what he is</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.050" end="01:06:57.340" style="s2">apparently experiencing which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:07:00.910" style="s2">about to learn more about that there is</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.340" end="01:07:03.880" style="s2">in the u.s. at least almost no and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.910" end="01:07:07.180" style="s2">no journalistic establishment that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.880" end="01:07:09.490" style="s2">not touched by this and that that is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.180" end="01:07:13.150" style="s2">frightening prospect right to have an</p>

<p begin="01:07:13.150" end="01:07:17.800" style="s2">certain mainstream perspectives because</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.550" end="01:07:23.700" style="s2">a fringe has decided that those things</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.800" end="01:07:25.600" style="s2">are intolerable is it is obviously a</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.700" end="01:07:27.370" style="s2">prelude to the death of the Republic</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.600" end="01:07:30.370" style="s2">either we figure out a way to reverse</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.370" end="01:07:32.320" style="s2">that or there is no Republic you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.370" end="01:07:34.570" style="s2">Benjamin Franklin&#39;s a republic if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.320" end="01:07:36.070" style="s2">can keep it was a warning and we won&#39;t</p>
