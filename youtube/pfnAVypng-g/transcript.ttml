<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:54.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t is especially not us because</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">Bentley like saw the vision right like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.570" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">think he already had the vision of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">what a tech cooperative could be Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">also you know to a certain point but</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">there were three conversations one with</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">my brother a drill and one with Heather</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">one with David where I could see they</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">saw the vision like my brother I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:11.069" style="s2">talking about this for years and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite see my vision but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.069" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">he with game B&#39;s is more like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:19.890" style="s2">yes the together piece of tech is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">powerful like I feel like he got it more</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.890" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">than I had felt he got it in the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s just my interpretation of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:30.120" style="s2">but with Heather and David both who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.490" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">both very non tech necessarily more of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.120" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">the other side of like the personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">development they both like got it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">this way in two different conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">where I was like yes like the scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">is the thing like that brings us</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">together for like the infrastructure for</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">creating the community and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">brainstorming for brainstorming and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">being able to create something from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">ground up is game B and there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">this point where people get that like</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not just technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:03:00.660" style="s2">connection it&#39;s it&#39;s giving people</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">something they don&#39;t have right now that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.660" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">is a natural attractor that is the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">step and so I can just see that coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:09.600" style="s2">together it&#39;s already in me but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">like happening in in the world outside</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.600" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">so that&#39;s just where it was a few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:20.519" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve seen people make comments like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">well I would get more involved and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.519" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">know this includes myself as well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">would I would get warned volved in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:31.730" style="s2">in the video chats if I knew more or if</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:34.980" style="s2">I had more time or you know there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.730" end="00:03:41.610" style="s2">so I think the schedule water idea is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.980" end="00:03:43.110" style="s2">really good yeah I feel like I should</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.610" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">have rewatched our woman who two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.110" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">ago like right before this because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">was at the end of what we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">about we were it&#39;s kind of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t the scheduler exactly it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">kind of more of the like talent exchange</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">there was something there or it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">of like I&#39;m gonna continue on with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">conversation and then that way because</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:04.170" style="s2">of the Friday one and they&#39;re all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.170" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">it&#39;s how this wants to put my head at</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">the moment yeah I buy really crazier</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">metaponto right like I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:19.609" style="s2">stuff happening that is kind of aligned</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">with the game beat stuff but it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.609" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">lies outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:33.569" style="s2">a lot of platforms being developed</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.319" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">you know the p2p space and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.569" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">vieta I think it&#39;s called just different</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">platforms and I&#39;m wondering what people</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">think of like piggybacking on some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:48.900" style="s2">this stuff or bringing it in or or</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:51.630" style="s2">instead of trying to like you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.900" end="00:04:55.979" style="s2">reinvent the wheel with everything if</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.630" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">there is a way to actually surface all</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.979" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">of this stuff as well and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:04.979" style="s2">addition to surfacing our projects but</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:08.370" style="s2">surfacing these outside things as well</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.979" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">and to determine whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.370" end="00:05:15.449" style="s2">would be useful yeah I think our</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:18.229" style="s2">philosophy should be and I think Julie</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.449" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">and magically agree is we&#39;re gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.229" end="00:05:23.009" style="s2">whatever is out there right now as long</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">as it doesn&#39;t have as long as it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.009" end="00:05:28.490" style="s2">drag us too much towards game a which</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:33.509" style="s2">you know Facebook and Twitter are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.490" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">like change your brain and to game a so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.509" end="00:05:37.590" style="s2">it might be good at some point to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">that but yeah reuse as much that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.590" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">there and it&#39;s my other groups and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:45.570" style="s2">be kind of a central clearinghouse on on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.990" style="s2">what tools are out there and how they</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.570" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">can be used in projects most efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.990" end="00:05:58.949" style="s2">right yeah I see that as a real boost</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">you know potential boost because there</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.949" end="00:06:04.710" style="s2">is a lot of stuff going on out there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:06.900" style="s2">I&#39;m always amazed to discover something</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.710" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">and realize that you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.900" end="00:06:12.780" style="s2">really game a it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty aligned</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:14.789" style="s2">with what&#39;s going on in the game B but</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.780" end="00:06:18.210" style="s2">they&#39;re separate they&#39;re you know there</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.789" end="00:06:20.430" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a connection made yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.210" end="00:06:22.110" style="s2">was I was to that point I was playing</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.430" end="00:06:26.909" style="s2">with bubble Daiya and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.110" end="00:06:30.719" style="s2">expensive that I would like but you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.909" end="00:06:35.599" style="s2">do one kind of free app prototype per</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.719" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">account and it lets you drag and drop</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.599" end="00:06:40.500" style="s2">forms and elements but also has a work</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.689" style="s2">so after they submit the data here it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.500" end="00:06:46.199" style="s2">can go into here and it can connect out</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.689" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">to to Google or to therapy or stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.199" end="00:06:53.310" style="s2">that so I think that&#39;ll be a good tool</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">for if we have an idea to quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.310" end="00:07:00.419" style="s2">prototype it and get feedback using</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">mostly the free account but only one</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.419" end="00:07:05.460" style="s2">person the free account is one person</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">for one app and it doesn&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.460" end="00:07:11.190" style="s2">automation but we could someone could</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:12.330" style="s2">take the initiative and prototype it and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.190" end="00:07:15.750" style="s2">we could play with it and see if it</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.330" end="00:07:17.460" style="s2">works and then you know then move it off</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.750" end="00:07:19.020" style="s2">on our own platform unless someone wants</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.460" end="00:07:23.099" style="s2">to pay for the bubble account</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.020" end="00:07:25.349" style="s2">I was looking at yesterday was it I said</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.099" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">up to 50 people like what it&#39;d be 50 of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.349" end="00:07:31.319" style="s2">us collaborating on Caribbean or 50</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:33.060" style="s2">people like with accounts that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.319" end="00:07:37.889" style="s2">signing up to be part of the scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.060" end="00:07:40.680" style="s2">like is it I actually didn&#39;t see the 50</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.889" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">person thing so maybe that&#39;s of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.680" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">users of the app you&#39;re creating I know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:51.719" style="s2">you can only have one app designer so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.060" end="00:07:53.669" style="s2">may not have seen that limitation so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.719" end="00:07:55.409" style="s2">think I&#39;m what we&#39;re doing for the meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.669" end="00:07:57.479" style="s2">project right we&#39;re meeting on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.409" end="00:08:02.099" style="s2">Fridays and figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.479" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">facilitates projects and what is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.099" end="00:08:07.229" style="s2">draw those people in that&#39;s where those</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:09.210" style="s2">people but we&#39;re also the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.229" end="00:08:10.379" style="s2">don&#39;t have projects and want to work on</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.210" end="00:08:11.969" style="s2">projects right now kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.379" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">brainstorming brainstorming is is how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.969" end="00:08:16.889" style="s2">include everyone does it have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:19.560" style="s2">project and I think that in and of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.889" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">itself is like that is the scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.560" end="00:08:22.620" style="s2">right it&#39;s like well you just come and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">you need to know which conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.620" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">be a part of and what your time zone is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">but to have that conversation with what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:32.459" style="s2">do they want right because we can think</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:34.260" style="s2">what they want and put it into it but to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.459" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">actually say that was kind of what I did</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.260" end="00:08:37.620" style="s2">on the game beast face yesterday it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:39.630" style="s2">like wow we&#39;re having these</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.620" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">conversations I&#39;m really enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.630" end="00:08:44.430" style="s2">I seem to be okay getting into</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:47.579" style="s2">conversations a little too much but what</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.430" end="00:08:49.829" style="s2">is it that stops them and the answers</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.579" end="00:08:51.889" style="s2">that I thought of and were there were</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.829" end="00:08:53.239" style="s2">like time zone and scheduling like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.889" end="00:08:54.379" style="s2">knew it was happening I would probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.239" end="00:08:56.449" style="s2">come on board and then there&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.379" end="00:09:00.049" style="s2">ones of like well I&#39;m not comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.449" end="00:09:01.609" style="s2">yet I don&#39;t feel you know I I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.049" end="00:09:03.649" style="s2">to be seen in that space or I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.609" end="00:09:05.989" style="s2">watcher and we&#39;ve had those</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.649" end="00:09:08.119" style="s2">conversations Buffy he introverts and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.989" end="00:09:09.529" style="s2">how do we make them feel safe and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.119" end="00:09:10.970" style="s2">about having those conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.529" end="00:09:13.790" style="s2">them and having it be a space that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.970" end="00:09:16.579" style="s2">live on YouTube and I want to zoom there</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.790" end="00:09:18.309" style="s2">is that and then creating a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.579" end="00:09:21.980" style="s2">being able to make mistakes both</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.309" end="00:09:23.540" style="s2">technical and personal you know to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.980" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">able to like lose your and still</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.540" end="00:09:30.859" style="s2">have Redemption I think it&#39;d be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:33.619" style="s2">to on you know so say you say you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.859" end="00:09:35.179" style="s2">discover a project and you&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.619" end="00:09:38.149" style="s2">in it but you don&#39;t really have the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.179" end="00:09:42.069" style="s2">skills or expertise to contribute to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.149" end="00:09:44.869" style="s2">but you would like to stay with it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.069" end="00:09:48.559" style="s2">maybe there&#39;d be a way to have like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.869" end="00:09:50.899" style="s2">breakout something or other where you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.559" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">can actually talk to the people involved</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.899" end="00:09:56.540" style="s2">and learn more and you know either</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">determine whether that&#39;s a good fit for</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.540" end="00:10:03.079" style="s2">you in the future or you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:09.499" style="s2">need to do to get up to speed to become</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.079" end="00:10:10.489" style="s2">a participant in that project I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.499" end="00:10:13.489" style="s2">that&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.489" end="00:10:14.689" style="s2">like but it&#39;s getting those people</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.489" end="00:10:16.879" style="s2">involves getting the people under</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.689" end="00:10:18.350" style="s2">projects involved to say what would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.879" end="00:10:19.549" style="s2">need from a group of people what would</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.350" end="00:10:22.489" style="s2">get them up to speed what are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.549" end="00:10:25.189" style="s2">comfortable sharing and not hurting and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.489" end="00:10:28.759" style="s2">then for the people like who want to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.189" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">involved what do you feel comfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.759" end="00:10:32.629" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to be handed here</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:33.799" style="s2">here&#39;s our marking account go for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.629" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">right like you want to know that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.799" end="00:10:37.429" style="s2">have the skill to be able to do a thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:38.929" style="s2">and to get it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.429" end="00:10:40.759" style="s2">does it make sense to you right is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.929" end="00:10:42.619" style="s2">all in technical jargon because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.759" end="00:10:44.149" style="s2">one of the reasons I haven&#39;t felt that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.619" end="00:10:46.339" style="s2">can get involved in the peer-to-peer or</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.149" end="00:10:50.660" style="s2">in spiral or those things is it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.339" end="00:10:53.749" style="s2">tech people it&#39;s for like even when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.660" end="00:10:55.339" style="s2">say it&#39;s not it&#39;s like uh it&#39;s still you</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.749" end="00:10:57.319" style="s2">need to have a certain amount of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.339" end="00:11:00.319" style="s2">information to be able to be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.319" end="00:11:02.539" style="s2">oh and I think there needs to be a space</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.319" end="00:11:03.889" style="s2">for everyone a space for that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.539" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">make sense to me make it make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.889" end="00:11:06.290" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.339" style="s2">right if you&#39;re interested in it there</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.290" end="00:11:09.139" style="s2">should be a way to disseminate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.339" end="00:11:12.110" style="s2">information that gets you up to speed</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.139" end="00:11:13.100" style="s2">without right the CEO needing to sit</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.110" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">down with you and have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.100" end="00:11:17.420" style="s2">and walk you through it right like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.810" end="00:11:20.540" style="s2">can&#39;t be one on one time and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.420" end="00:11:21.800" style="s2">I think if you know like right now it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.540" end="00:11:23.629" style="s2">could be for our projects because</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.800" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not very far but when you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.629" end="00:11:27.769" style="s2">30 people contacting you every week</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:29.720" style="s2">there needs to be a process for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.769" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">coming part of our live conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.720" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">read this white page before then great</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:37.509" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s important you know we</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:42.470" style="s2">all have limited capacities both</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.509" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">cognitively you know time resources but</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.470" end="00:11:48.439" style="s2">what what I would hope is going to start</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:51.410" style="s2">happening here is just this a huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.439" end="00:11:57.649" style="s2">balloon expansion of opportunities and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:12:01.399" style="s2">new ideas and you know right now in game</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.649" end="00:12:03.769" style="s2">a type dynamics you know it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.399" end="00:12:05.689" style="s2">well it looks like I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.769" end="00:12:07.610" style="s2">this sort of thing so now I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.689" end="00:12:12.319" style="s2">to school for four years you know major</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.610" end="00:12:15.199" style="s2">in computer science or whatever and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.319" end="00:12:18.100" style="s2">of that might not be necessary actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.199" end="00:12:21.500" style="s2">to contribute to something that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.100" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">determined through this process we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.500" end="00:12:26.269" style="s2">talking about that you&#39;re passionate</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:28.579" style="s2">about but there&#39;s really no other</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.269" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">recourse at this point to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.579" end="00:12:34.250" style="s2">involved in this so um you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:36.199" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know maybe there isn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.250" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s another way to approach</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.199" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">this kind of thing yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:46.579" style="s2">talked about it last time it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:48.439" style="s2">showing up as you is enough if the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.579" end="00:12:50.600" style="s2">platform is there to facilitate that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.439" end="00:12:51.829" style="s2">the culture is there to allow that right</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.600" end="00:12:53.959" style="s2">that people can show up and make</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.829" end="00:12:57.319" style="s2">mistakes and that there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.959" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">kindly be like if there is a circle of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.319" end="00:13:00.680" style="s2">expertise that you have to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:02.509" style="s2">like a technology you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.680" end="00:13:03.889" style="s2">we&#39;re coding this you need to know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.509" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about in order to be part</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.889" end="00:13:09.740" style="s2">of this conversation that it&#39;s not done</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:11.000" style="s2">hopefully in a shame creating way right</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.740" end="00:13:12.380" style="s2">like you&#39;re not deficient because you</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.000" end="00:13:13.579" style="s2">can&#39;t be part of that conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.380" end="00:13:15.529" style="s2">just can&#39;t be part of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.579" end="00:13:17.540" style="s2">and there&#39;s other ways for you to be</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.540" end="00:13:22.759" style="s2">right you know an ability to really</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.269" end="00:13:25.850" style="s2">determine you know what I&#39;m just this</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.759" end="00:13:28.370" style="s2">isn&#39;t my thing you know I&#39;m or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.850" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">too much to learn you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.370" end="00:13:32.870" style="s2">like you know you can&#39;t just say oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.819" style="s2">interested in this blockchain project</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.870" end="00:13:36.970" style="s2">and now I mean I start coding next week</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.819" end="00:13:42.470" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.970" end="00:13:45.019" style="s2">but you know there there is a path</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.470" end="00:13:47.089" style="s2">without having to go get a computer</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.019" end="00:13:49.880" style="s2">science degree to I mean people already</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.089" end="00:13:53.509" style="s2">do that but there&#39;s it&#39;s not easy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.880" end="00:13:55.759" style="s2">it&#39;s hard and the whole failure thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.509" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">constantly comes in you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.759" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">well I&#39;m not gonna even try that because</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:11.029" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid of failure so yeah okay one</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">of the things that is coming up is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.029" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">a makes things more complicated we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:18.319" style="s2">need more a more complicated platform to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:20.149" style="s2">create but a volunteer platform it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.319" end="00:14:23.209" style="s2">actually is dealing with like actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.149" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">not-for-profits and social enterprises</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.209" end="00:14:30.470" style="s2">and it just a job description type one</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">but also with the UM backend to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.470" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">help facilitate that process right if</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">you have an event you need caterers at</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:39.769" style="s2">like whatever the actual job is I know</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:42.230" style="s2">they kind of already exist fall into</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.769" end="00:14:43.399" style="s2">your platforms but not really like</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.230" end="00:14:44.899" style="s2">whatever I&#39;ve looked at them they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.399" end="00:14:46.940" style="s2">they don&#39;t meet the person where they</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.899" end="00:14:48.649" style="s2">are and they don&#39;t they&#39;re not so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.940" end="00:14:49.850" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have enough all into your</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.649" end="00:14:51.800" style="s2">people on there like they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.850" end="00:14:54.500" style="s2">enough organizations that need</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.800" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">volunteers on there if it wasn&#39;t I as</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.500" end="00:14:57.860" style="s2">the Cancer Foundation person have to put</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:00.529" style="s2">arms on there but anyone can put it on</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.860" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">there and say hey I know that we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.529" end="00:15:05.149" style="s2">you know we&#39;re doing a marathon this</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.459" style="s2">weekend and we need people to hand out</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.149" end="00:15:09.439" style="s2">juice and have it be more simple to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.459" end="00:15:11.149" style="s2">volunteer to get people to get because</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.439" end="00:15:12.470" style="s2">that brings the people and then have</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.149" end="00:15:14.360" style="s2">ways that people can just be part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.470" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">conversations but that seems a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.360" end="00:15:18.850" style="s2">convoluted to get the people from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:18.850" style="s2">scheduler and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.150" end="00:15:35.830" style="s2">so what&#39;s the kind of next step to move</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.920" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">forward on the ability to brainstorm is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.830" end="00:15:47.140" style="s2">it yeah I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:48.370" style="s2">through that oh I think you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.140" end="00:15:56.010" style="s2">something earlier and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.370" end="00:15:59.500" style="s2">you got this a well yeah next I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.010" end="00:16:02.620" style="s2">one thing that I was hoping we could</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.500" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">touch on is this time is what are we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.620" end="00:16:14.830" style="s2">gonna do next you know do we break out a</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:20.590" style="s2">another separate video chat around the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.830" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">subject and zoom into it more or how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.590" end="00:16:25.990" style="s2">approach that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:30.850" style="s2">well maybe we kind of summarize what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.990" end="00:16:34.540" style="s2">lessons we learned or first so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.850" end="00:16:39.090" style="s2">about that it would be good if it was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.540" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">place it may be focusing it more on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.090" end="00:16:44.590" style="s2">space where people can bring problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">and then work with a group to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.590" end="00:16:53.770" style="s2">solutions so do we need I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">just scheduling a recurring video call</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.770" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">where people can just throw problems and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">have everyone brainstorm solutions I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:09.040" style="s2">think would be a good next step and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:12.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we want this to also</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.040" end="00:17:14.460" style="s2">include the whole I mean is our whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.460" end="00:17:16.900" style="s2">discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.460" end="00:17:22.430" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.900" end="00:17:24.890" style="s2">about volunteers and project you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.430" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">database list of projects and tools that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.890" end="00:17:30.310" style="s2">all part of the brainstorming space or</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:34.460" style="s2">is that just part of together tech as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.310" end="00:17:37.100" style="s2">detective space or sort of a lot I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.460" end="00:17:40.430" style="s2">I like the idea of like a zoom call or</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.100" end="00:17:42.970" style="s2">conference type situation where people</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.430" end="00:17:46.390" style="s2">can bring problems to me we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.970" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">source solutions how do we want to like</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.390" end="00:17:51.290" style="s2">brands that like is it hey I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">trouble with my kid she&#39;s not sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.290" end="00:17:56.420" style="s2">through the night or is it getting be</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">problems right like I need to know how</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.420" end="00:18:01.580" style="s2">to feed myself so that I can concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:03.950" style="s2">on this because those are similar and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.580" end="00:18:05.150" style="s2">yet not quite or are they no I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.950" end="00:18:06.530" style="s2">together tech for figuring out a</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.150" end="00:18:08.390" style="s2">schedule or how do we move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:10.820" style="s2">it like it&#39;s an actual game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.390" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">is it game be people with problems or is</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.820" end="00:18:18.020" style="s2">it a bigger circle of just life because</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">everything&#39;s game B I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.020" end="00:18:26.300" style="s2">it be more yeah I don&#39;t know how to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">it but not so much like individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.300" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">issues for like individual people but</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:39.860" style="s2">more like you know people that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:43.010" style="s2">finding how they want to where they want</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.860" end="00:18:44.690" style="s2">to provide value to the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.010" end="00:18:46.580" style="s2">they&#39;ve identified a problem that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:50.870" style="s2">they&#39;re passionate about and then so</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.580" end="00:18:54.260" style="s2">like what&#39;s the next step yeah or they</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.870" end="00:18:55.820" style="s2">have more problem to solve right let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.820" end="00:19:00.170" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.540" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">yeah right or just even also if there</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:04.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t any of that then the next thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:06.110" style="s2">would be you know here&#39;s a project I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.040" end="00:19:07.970" style="s2">working on here&#39;s a problem I hit in it</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.110" end="00:19:10.130" style="s2">let&#39;s just all which is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.970" end="00:19:12.920" style="s2">continuation of the project raising</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.130" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">thing but that&#39;s another option second</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.920" end="00:19:18.020" style="s2">object mm-hmm kind of my groups it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:20.570" style="s2">the coopertition yeah like it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.570" end="00:19:26.200" style="s2">keep that separate over there but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:29.740" style="s2">yeah I think I think it was last</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.200" end="00:19:33.460" style="s2">Saturday Jonas brought up</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.740" end="00:19:39.180" style="s2">talking about scale of you know problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.460" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">so one one potential function of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.180" end="00:19:43.530" style="s2">brainstorming our brainstorming could be</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.970" style="s2">bringing your problem to the group and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.530" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">kind of brainstorming over you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.970" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the scale this problem and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:53.770" style="s2">are the resources that potentially we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:57.460" style="s2">can surface to help with this problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.770" end="00:20:00.010" style="s2">and is that doable you know is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:04.030" style="s2">scale like we&#39;re gonna solve climate</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.010" end="00:20:05.620" style="s2">change well no we&#39;re not you know we</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.030" end="00:20:10.330" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t have the resources and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.620" end="00:20:12.340" style="s2">the people available here to do that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.330" end="00:20:16.570" style="s2">know that&#39;s an extreme example but kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.340" end="00:20:18.820" style="s2">of determined you know the scale of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.570" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">potential scale of a project that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.820" end="00:20:23.980" style="s2">concerned about what resources might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:26.590" style="s2">available to start working on that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.980" end="00:20:39.210" style="s2">know who&#39;s interested in it and all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.590" end="00:20:43.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to facilitate that okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.210" end="00:20:47.230" style="s2">wait so yeah I&#39;d say that one more time</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.140" end="00:20:50.800" style="s2">okay so you know so you know you bring a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.230" end="00:20:53.650" style="s2">you bring a problem to the group that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.800" end="00:20:57.490" style="s2">you&#39;re passionate about and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.650" end="00:21:01.000" style="s2">you&#39;re not there might be some question</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.490" end="00:21:03.880" style="s2">as to the scale of the problem as far as</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.000" end="00:21:09.630" style="s2">you know the problem solution space is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.880" end="00:21:15.700" style="s2">is there a solution that is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.630" end="00:21:20.140" style="s2">possible given the resources the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.700" end="00:21:23.890" style="s2">the interest that we can surface in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.140" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">group to help you along to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.890" end="00:21:31.750" style="s2">of of solving that problem because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">not always clear you know it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.750" end="00:21:35.410" style="s2">why I&#39;ve brought up also you know all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">the platforms and the projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.410" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">happening out there so it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:46.070" style="s2">clear of that that problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.460" end="00:21:47.050" style="s2">is solvable at at the scale we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.070" end="00:21:51.530" style="s2">working at here</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.050" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">well I yeah I think though if if we just</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.530" end="00:21:59.900" style="s2">simply have like a repeating meeting</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:22:02.390" style="s2">where anyone can join pitch their</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.900" end="00:22:04.730" style="s2">problem and then then that would be part</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.390" end="00:22:07.430" style="s2">of the discussion is how could they take</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.730" end="00:22:12.380" style="s2">the next step towards it or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.430" end="00:22:16.180" style="s2">that we would ever say it&#39;s too big to</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.380" end="00:22:19.550" style="s2">be for us to contribute to it as</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.180" end="00:22:20.890" style="s2">individuals nor that individual but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.550" end="00:22:23.420" style="s2">could definitely be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.890" end="00:22:24.530" style="s2">discussion but I wouldn&#39;t I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.420" end="00:22:26.630" style="s2">can&#39;t think of it I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.530" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">a need for to put any formality around</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.630" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">that except maybe to have a list of when</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:36.560" style="s2">someone brings a problem what are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:39.380" style="s2">topics like funding resources existing</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.560" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">technology that could be reused existing</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.380" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">projects that solve the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">we could use as a guide when we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:47.800" style="s2">through the discussion but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:51.980" style="s2">it needs being more formal than that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.800" end="00:22:55.310" style="s2">okay now that that makes sense I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.980" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">just going through that process I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.310" end="00:23:01.370" style="s2">yeah you would be able to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:03.110" style="s2">out yeah it&#39;s really the the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.370" end="00:23:05.240" style="s2">knowledge the skills and the experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.110" end="00:23:06.980" style="s2">of the other people that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.240" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">the value just and just to have someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.980" end="00:23:10.300" style="s2">to bounce your ideas off of so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">not in this little bitty echo chamber</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.300" end="00:23:17.240" style="s2">right yeah I think that&#39;s a huge value</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:20.570" style="s2">to anyone but maybe back to Julie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.240" end="00:23:24.310" style="s2">question how do we want to kind of brand</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.570" end="00:23:27.670" style="s2">this or maybe we could construct the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.310" end="00:23:30.290" style="s2">name and then a one or two sentence</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.670" end="00:23:34.130" style="s2">description so that people will know</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.290" end="00:23:36.850" style="s2">what to expect or be attracted to doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.130" end="00:23:36.850" style="s2">that if they want</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.919" end="00:23:54.059" style="s2">brainstorm eon brainstorming is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.629" end="00:23:58.440" style="s2">of awkward yes yes it is yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.059" end="00:24:00.470" style="s2">something like yeah I don&#39;t know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.440" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">the long way of saying it talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.470" end="00:24:08.879" style="s2">I&#39;ve found a problem in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:14.610" style="s2">I&#39;m passionate about help me figure out</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.879" end="00:24:20.600" style="s2">what&#39;s next right about what&#39;s next yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.610" end="00:24:24.409" style="s2">I just ordered the patch that says that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.600" end="00:24:30.090" style="s2">yeah but I I think we do need this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.409" end="00:24:32.309" style="s2">or maybe something like first steps mmm</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.090" end="00:24:34.139" style="s2">because they&#39;re there they&#39;re coming or</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.309" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">maybe even we need to open up further</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.139" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">and say well I don&#39;t know okay I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:40.889" style="s2">gonna say I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.169" style="s2">passionate about or what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.889" end="00:24:46.350" style="s2">but really for those people they need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.169" end="00:24:47.850" style="s2">watch the project raising calls and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.350" end="00:24:49.769" style="s2">can get interested in an existing</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.850" end="00:24:58.830" style="s2">project right so that&#39;s not this space</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.769" end="00:25:03.480" style="s2">this space is yeah I mean yeah it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.830" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">of like does this speak to anybody when</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.480" end="00:25:10.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a current event that happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:13.740" style="s2">like the coronavirus or that Iran</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.019" end="00:25:15.299" style="s2">America thing right now game a is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.740" end="00:25:16.950" style="s2">just like we don&#39;t know what&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.299" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">going on we don&#39;t and there&#39;s sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.950" end="00:25:20.730" style="s2">making projects but there isn&#39;t a space</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:22.230" style="s2">to actually go and talk about it to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.730" end="00:25:24.419" style="s2">about your fears to talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.230" end="00:25:26.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not happiness I don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.419" end="00:25:27.869" style="s2">can do anything about the corona virus</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:29.909" style="s2">but to be able to just have a space to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.869" end="00:25:31.259" style="s2">go and chat means that those things</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.909" end="00:25:33.059" style="s2">could come up but I think he lights a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.259" end="00:25:35.399" style="s2">completely different project but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.059" end="00:25:37.740" style="s2">something about that where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.399" end="00:25:41.159" style="s2">like the inkling of I care about this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.740" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">thing it&#39;s in my emotions how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.159" end="00:25:44.610" style="s2">start having a conversation I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:47.519" style="s2">that brings more people to the table</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.610" end="00:25:49.850" style="s2">because that&#39;s my worry is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.519" end="00:25:51.900" style="s2">just going to be the three or four of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.850" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">solving problems for people</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.900" end="00:25:55.170" style="s2">right like how do we bring people to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:57.420" style="s2">table to be part of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.170" end="00:25:59.040" style="s2">have it be a zoom call with you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.420" end="00:26:00.990" style="s2">like 50 people we are broken out into</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.040" end="00:26:05.430" style="s2">groups and this is the problem for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.990" end="00:26:07.680" style="s2">week right huh that&#39;s interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.430" end="00:26:12.200" style="s2">problems mark yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.680" end="00:26:12.200" style="s2">definitely has an overlap with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.170" end="00:26:22.500" style="s2">yeah and it can be very game be specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.890" end="00:26:24.110" style="s2">it could be racism and game be right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.500" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">like something that&#39;s like brought up</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.110" end="00:26:32.790" style="s2">emotion that week and I think people</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:35.910" style="s2">want to talk about I think valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.790" end="00:26:38.460" style="s2">and maybe this is a bit reductionist but</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.910" end="00:26:42.900" style="s2">you know you bring in a problem and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.460" end="00:26:46.440" style="s2">kind of talk about it and 0 into more</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.900" end="00:26:48.540" style="s2">first principles and determine you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.440" end="00:26:51.390" style="s2">what kind of problem what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.540" end="00:26:53.220" style="s2">solution really are we talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.390" end="00:26:55.590" style="s2">know we&#39;re not we&#39;re not going to solve</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.220" end="00:26:59.570" style="s2">this problem in in the box that exists</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.590" end="00:27:03.870" style="s2">in we have to drill down deeper and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.570" end="00:27:05.580" style="s2">for me what a useful framework for me is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.870" end="00:27:10.020" style="s2">thinking in terms of Gabey and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.580" end="00:27:13.110" style="s2">transition be so you know is this a is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.020" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">this a solution at the level that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.110" end="00:27:18.630" style="s2">problem is to be solved that that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:21.000" style="s2">more of a transition problem that we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.630" end="00:27:25.530" style="s2">start working on right now for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.000" end="00:27:27.720" style="s2">okay maybe blockchain isn&#39;t ideal maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.530" end="00:27:31.020" style="s2">it&#39;s got a whole host of problems but</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.720" end="00:27:33.120" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s a transitional solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.020" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">that&#39;ll work and we can get started on</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.120" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">it so you know kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:48.900" style="s2">determining the space in that way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:51.150" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m thinking of another so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:52.980" style="s2">Jubilee talked about there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.150" end="00:27:54.600" style="s2">topical issue coming up that we may</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.980" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2">people may want to discuss and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.600" end="00:28:00.300" style="s2">problem-solve around it I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:28:03.000" style="s2">there&#39;s also the I already have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.300" end="00:28:05.700" style="s2">passion like I discussed so I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.000" end="00:28:07.139" style="s2">that but I don&#39;t know where to start</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.700" end="00:28:09.299" style="s2">know if anyone&#39;s actually gonna be in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.139" end="00:28:11.130" style="s2">that space I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.299" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">everyone has a passion about something</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.130" end="00:28:15.269" style="s2">and before they get to the call they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:17.250" style="s2">have started on a solution path and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.269" end="00:28:18.990" style="s2">there are a project right I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.250" end="00:28:24.570" style="s2">if you can see it that way or not but</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.990" end="00:28:26.700" style="s2">also there&#39;s the space of I want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.570" end="00:28:28.740" style="s2">value to the world so maybe it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.700" end="00:28:31.230" style="s2">brainstorming where a person comes in</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.740" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">and says I want to provide more value to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.230" end="00:28:35.490" style="s2">the world let&#39;s brainstorm how I can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:36.690" style="s2">that and then in that discussion we talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.490" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">about what are you passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.690" end="00:28:42.899" style="s2">about food about poverty about about</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:44.100" style="s2">decision-making about you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.899" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">we kind of help them through the process</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.100" end="00:28:49.470" style="s2">so maybe it&#39;s more focused on an</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.760" style="s2">individual that wants to provide more</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.470" end="00:28:53.639" style="s2">value because that sounds like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.760" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">even more kind of what I think this</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.639" end="00:29:01.100" style="s2">started out as Edward II can correct me</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:05.100" style="s2">no I think you&#39;re right that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.100" end="00:29:07.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a something here for like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.100" end="00:29:09.809" style="s2">let&#39;s say a two hour conference for</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.320" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">people anyone in the Gabey space or</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.809" end="00:29:15.179" style="s2">pupae notes the bigger community for</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.049" end="00:31:20.659" style="s2">would caution against calling at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:22.890" style="s2">conference until we know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.659" end="00:31:24.809" style="s2">large enough group of people for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.890" end="00:31:27.090" style="s2">I&#39;d almost say let&#39;s just call it a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.809" end="00:31:30.210" style="s2">call and if there&#39;s many people then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.090" end="00:31:32.520" style="s2">break up in groups but yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:35.460" style="s2">really like to see that level although I</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.520" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">think in game B everyone everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.460" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">already knows not everyone most people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:41.789" style="s2">know their passion so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:45.590" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a huge volume on this</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.789" end="00:31:48.120" style="s2">brainstorming piece yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.590" end="00:31:51.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking too it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.120" end="00:31:54.570" style="s2">it&#39;s more at the levels start your</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.210" end="00:31:56.549" style="s2">passion I mean if you&#39;re not sure of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.570" end="00:31:59.520" style="s2">your passion maybe you just hang out and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.549" end="00:32:05.970" style="s2">watch and determine that that if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.520" end="00:32:07.409" style="s2">start down at that level it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.970" end="00:32:10.169" style="s2">start your passion is great because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.409" end="00:32:11.640" style="s2">think I think people will Intuit that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.169" end="00:32:14.190" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what their passion is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.640" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">that starting would include finding it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.190" end="00:32:18.090" style="s2">so maybe that&#39;s kind of assumed mmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.460" style="s2">y&#39;all can correct me if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.090" end="00:32:21.990" style="s2">that&#39;s too far two steps so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.460" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">could count like start my passion or</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.990" end="00:32:28.200" style="s2">start my value and and it&#39;ll still draw</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.200" end="00:32:32.419" style="s2">do something in this space but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:32.419" style="s2">know where to start</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.410" end="00:32:38.790" style="s2">right Wow because we want the people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:40.680" style="s2">know what their passion is they know</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.790" end="00:32:41.820" style="s2">it&#39;s technology they don&#39;t say they know</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.680" end="00:32:44.370" style="s2">it we don&#39;t even like they know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.820" end="00:32:45.480" style="s2">piece but also people have no idea who</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.370" end="00:32:48.300" style="s2">are like I&#39;m just here because I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.480" end="00:32:50.040" style="s2">game B I don&#39;t know where I fit but once</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.300" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">other people start talking about it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.040" end="00:32:52.560" style="s2">think you start resonating oh yes I want</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.780" end="00:32:57.960" style="s2">part of a conversation on all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.190" end="00:33:00.810" style="s2">different things or they might focus in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.960" end="00:33:02.430" style="s2">on one of them and we could certainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.810" end="00:33:04.050" style="s2">explain that this is all sort of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.430" end="00:33:05.790" style="s2">that have no idea what their passion is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.050" end="00:33:08.490" style="s2">just to clarify but yeah I think the</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.510" end="00:34:09.600" style="s2">you could edit out just one person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.110" end="00:34:13.110" style="s2">passion discussion and brainstorming if</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.600" end="00:34:14.909" style="s2">we wanted to but yeah I agree especially</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.590" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">then we&#39;re brainstorming it and then a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.149" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">drills right that&#39;s much easier to cut</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">out then like yeah mines intermix</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.830" end="00:34:26.190" style="s2">throughout all of it and that&#39;s how it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.470" end="00:34:45.159" style="s2">could also be right that somewhat chunky</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.889" end="00:34:48.460" style="s2">for like these are your project</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.159" end="00:34:49.990" style="s2">and also yeah who we want it&#39;ll be great</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.460" end="00:34:51.399" style="s2">for the person to have that to put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.990" end="00:34:53.230" style="s2">out to game be right like they always</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.399" end="00:34:54.549" style="s2">said are able to talk amazingly about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.230" end="00:34:56.679" style="s2">the thing that they&#39;re passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.549" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">food and then it&#39;s like to put that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.679" end="00:35:00.490" style="s2">piece out so people can watch it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:03.099" style="s2">that also works with just taking the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.490" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">time I&#39;m talking at the 24 minute mark</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.099" end="00:35:10.089" style="s2">and sharing from that point right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:12.369" style="s2">sooo mning everyone&#39;s okay with it being</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.089" end="00:35:14.020" style="s2">shared so it&#39;s still don&#39;t have to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.369" end="00:35:20.260" style="s2">permission from everyone that really had</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.020" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">a substantial piece right right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.260" end="00:35:26.289" style="s2">like audio too but not on YouTube yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:28.809" style="s2">right Supercop also we probably want to</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.610" end="00:39:23.090" style="s2">leading early fear about that yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.470" end="00:39:25.010" style="s2">means that if you have the median it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.090" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">oh it can only go on for 24 hours and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.010" end="00:39:29.030" style="s2">you have to restart a new meeting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:33.020" style="s2">it there&#39;s people coming in and out then</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.750" end="00:39:42.710" style="s2">think what&#39;s the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.520" end="00:39:45.170" style="s2">tears I&#39;m just thinking from like a game</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.710" end="00:39:46.910" style="s2">a pricing model and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.170" end="00:39:47.780" style="s2">perfectly marthy hit that limit that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.910" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">good problem to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.780" end="00:39:53.990" style="s2">well if you get to the next level you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:55.880" style="s2">get like 300 participants mm-hmm so it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.880" end="00:40:00.830" style="s2">well there&#39;s several other features but</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.620" end="00:40:03.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the important one custom branding</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.830" end="00:40:07.190" style="s2">custom emails single sign-on energy</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.380" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">domains Oh vanity URL stuff like that oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:11.990" style="s2">all like the sort of the be nice to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:15.560" style="s2">enterprise stuff yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.990" end="00:40:17.900" style="s2">come business side that was my business</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.560" end="00:40:21.710" style="s2">model for cafe it was like we just have</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.900" end="00:40:23.000" style="s2">zoom accounts 100 like $15 a month for</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.710" end="00:40:25.160" style="s2">every hundred we have in the team at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.000" end="00:40:26.540" style="s2">same time slot for good but as long as</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.160" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">you&#39;re open and transparent about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.540" end="00:40:29.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s the level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:31.310" style="s2">professionalism around we&#39;re using zoom</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.300" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">like that&#39;s totally fine we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.310" end="00:40:36.440" style="s2">millions of dollars to put into new</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:38.120" style="s2">video software to create why not use</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.440" end="00:40:41.690" style="s2">what&#39;s already there and zoom works</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.120" end="00:40:42.920" style="s2">pretty good you also just I mean it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.690" end="00:40:45.260" style="s2">a little bit more complex and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.920" end="00:40:47.600" style="s2">everyone&#39;s on Facebook but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.260" end="00:40:51.230" style="s2">could have a group in Facebook and do a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.600" end="00:40:54.080" style="s2">meeting in there but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.230" end="00:40:56.060" style="s2">requires that require more management I</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.080" end="00:40:58.820" style="s2">mean I like the idea of having a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.060" end="00:41:01.370" style="s2">Facebook group where it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.820" end="00:41:03.860" style="s2">Saturday mornings right but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.370" end="00:41:05.210" style="s2">anyone can kind of say hey I want to I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.860" end="00:41:07.070" style="s2">have a problem I want a brain start at</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.210" end="00:41:08.690" style="s2">this time period but I feel like first</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.070" end="00:41:10.730" style="s2">we need the conference that&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.690" end="00:41:13.100" style="s2">conference like how much because if</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.730" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">there&#39;s four people interested starting</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.100" end="00:41:17.300" style="s2">a Facebook group doesn&#39;t make sense if</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">there&#39;s four people interested in</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.300" end="00:41:20.570" style="s2">starting a Facebook group and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:23.180" style="s2">gonna actively market it and get more</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.570" end="00:41:25.550" style="s2">people on board awesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.180" end="00:41:27.710" style="s2">that&#39;s where like if someone&#39;s passion</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.550" end="00:41:34.150" style="s2">project is this passion project right</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.710" end="00:41:36.740" style="s2">right it needs some energy behind it I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.150" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">think a problem with for lying too much</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.740" end="00:41:41.540" style="s2">on a Facebook group for something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:44.890" style="s2">this though is the ability to search and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.540" end="00:41:49.430" style="s2">find what you&#39;re looking for just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.890" end="00:41:52.610" style="s2">horrible on Facebook and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.430" end="00:41:56.630" style="s2">pretty important function for what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.610" end="00:41:58.910" style="s2">talking about here you know oh I heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.630" end="00:42:01.570" style="s2">this and this will apply to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.910" end="00:42:03.800" style="s2">thinking about right now but where is it</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.570" end="00:42:06.260" style="s2">yeah although if we&#39;re doing mostly</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.800" end="00:42:11.260" style="s2">video we&#39;re gonna it&#39;s not searchable</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.260" end="00:42:17.690" style="s2">either but yeah yeah is anyone aware of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.260" end="00:42:21.110" style="s2">any decent transcription software but</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.690" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">the auto Rio accounts that um I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.110" end="00:42:27.500" style="s2">transcribing stuff Anthony was and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.400" end="00:42:28.790" style="s2">someone kind of chastised him for it not</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.500" end="00:42:32.960" style="s2">I haven&#39;t seen him in the space since</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.790" end="00:42:36.050" style="s2">then unfortunately hmm and if we upload</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:41.210" style="s2">it to YouTube at some point I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.050" end="00:42:42.830" style="s2">that&#39;s got the built in one right yep</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.210" end="00:42:45.980" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s not the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.830" end="00:42:48.590" style="s2">transcription its searchable like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.980" end="00:42:52.010" style="s2">mean just just kind of a workaround I</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.590" end="00:42:54.320" style="s2">mean like Bentley says video isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.010" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">really searchable at this time but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.320" end="00:42:59.630" style="s2">can create workarounds that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:02.150" style="s2">aren&#39;t too much work I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.630" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">like having video and then having like a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.150" end="00:43:06.680" style="s2">Google Doc or something else where you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.750" style="s2">have to like actually pick what is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.680" end="00:43:10.280" style="s2">most important and salient and type it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.750" end="00:43:14.270" style="s2">out and put it in there right like hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.280" end="00:43:16.790" style="s2">we decided to create passion project</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.270" end="00:43:19.250" style="s2">right and like here&#39;s the bullet points</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.790" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not as great as AI doing it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.250" end="00:43:23.930" style="s2">there&#39;s I don&#39;t want to take notes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:29.480" style="s2">not really within my brains capacity at</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.930" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">all but that is the level for app is we</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.480" end="00:43:34.109" style="s2">do be doing that and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:36.569" style="s2">is like the more people willing to take</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.109" end="00:43:40.019" style="s2">notes and collect that information the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.569" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">more information we have to be I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.019" end="00:43:44.730" style="s2">that with like someone had done a is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:48.359" style="s2">Rome a Rome account for this one or they</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.730" end="00:43:50.130" style="s2">were yeah that&#39;s what I started you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.359" end="00:43:53.160" style="s2">started an effort look at me look at me</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.130" end="00:43:55.339" style="s2">I think Randy was the one that was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.160" end="00:43:58.500" style="s2">do the transcriptions I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.339" end="00:44:01.079" style="s2">yeah I just haven&#39;t had time to dig into</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.500" end="00:44:04.190" style="s2">it yet like like I would like to but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.079" end="00:44:07.019" style="s2">mean it&#39;s amazing they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.190" end="00:44:13.049" style="s2">you know switching it over to a paid</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.019" end="00:44:15.960" style="s2">model which you know if if it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.049" end="00:44:19.549" style="s2">to be what it appears it&#39;s going to be I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.960" end="00:44:25.710" style="s2">would consider it worth it for myself</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.549" end="00:44:28.140" style="s2">but yeah I just I mean it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.710" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">has to weigh links so basically you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.140" end="00:44:34.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have to organize things you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:36.210" style="s2">think about you know what category this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.140" end="00:44:38.730" style="s2">falls into or what category that falls</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.210" end="00:44:41.160" style="s2">into and create a you know a folder</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.730" end="00:44:44.250" style="s2">structured data structure for those</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.160" end="00:44:49.109" style="s2">things it just does it itself you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.250" end="00:44:51.660" style="s2">you basically any any word or concept or</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.109" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">name or whatever you turn it into a link</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.660" end="00:44:58.259" style="s2">and each link has its own page and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:45:01.039" style="s2">you know you could it just pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.259" end="00:45:04.619" style="s2">organizes itself so it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.039" end="00:45:09.769" style="s2">amazing way to take notes and be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.619" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">creative and integrate ideas together</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.769" end="00:45:18.450" style="s2">but I just don&#39;t know enough about at</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:20.069" style="s2">this point project to be it&#39;s figuring</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.450" end="00:45:21.509" style="s2">out all these things cuz they need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.069" end="00:45:23.759" style="s2">make money like they need to make money</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.509" end="00:45:25.710" style="s2">but making them paid and cuts out</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.759" end="00:45:28.529" style="s2">everybody like it&#39;s like you can&#39;t yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.710" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">$10 $15 month is an astronomical but</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.529" end="00:45:31.470" style="s2">when you add them all up it is right</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:32.549" style="s2">when you need all of these and they need</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.470" end="00:45:34.019" style="s2">to work together and they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.549" end="00:45:37.230" style="s2">work together cuz their game a or their</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.019" end="00:45:40.470" style="s2">game beat like the meta project needs to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.230" end="00:45:42.359" style="s2">figure out how do you get them paid get</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.470" end="00:45:44.789" style="s2">them to be sufficient well we&#39;re not for</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.220" end="00:45:57.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not during this time period for</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.990" end="00:46:01.980" style="s2">moving this forward for having people be</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.510" end="00:46:06.330" style="s2">able to know what we&#39;re doing and come</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.540" end="00:47:17.300" style="s2">doing that now he charges either a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.120" end="00:47:20.100" style="s2">members pay $3 a month which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.300" end="00:47:21.600" style="s2">still kind of a it&#39;s not a lot but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.100" end="00:47:23.100" style="s2">know once you have to put your credit</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.100" end="00:47:29.540" style="s2">or one cent per minute per person if he</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:33.000" style="s2">if the central organization wants to pay</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.540" end="00:47:37.140" style="s2">but it has a user zoom but it also has</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.780" end="00:47:47.550" style="s2">so he&#39;s kind of built this as an online</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.760" end="00:47:49.880" style="s2">discussion space so that might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.550" end="00:47:49.880" style="s2">another option</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.180" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m pulling up here it looks very</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.100" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.310" end="00:48:05.030" style="s2">qi qi o qi q o CH</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.510" end="00:48:07.880" style="s2">at comm yeah I put a I put a link in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.030" end="00:48:15.530" style="s2">private chat not a link I just put the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.880" end="00:48:17.330" style="s2">text it didn&#39;t turn into a link it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.530" end="00:48:19.700" style="s2">having those tools er but I also feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.330" end="00:48:21.170" style="s2">like 1 cent per minute like it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.700" end="00:48:22.790" style="s2">because that was like long-distance</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.170" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">calls when they were 10 cents and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.790" end="00:48:27.110" style="s2">were like nothing and now like it&#39;s free</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.760" style="s2">why would why would we pay for but</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.110" end="00:48:30.470" style="s2">having so if there&#39;s 10 people on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.760" end="00:48:32.330" style="s2">call it&#39;s 10 cents a minute and we want</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.470" end="00:48:34.840" style="s2">like a hundred people on the call so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.330" end="00:48:36.890" style="s2">feel like if we&#39;re paying for it it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.840" end="00:48:39.080" style="s2">makes more sense for us to figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.890" end="00:48:41.720" style="s2">Google Doc then for us to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.080" end="00:48:44.150" style="s2">have like have one common space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.720" end="00:48:48.140" style="s2">like here&#39;s the list of each Google Doc</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.150" end="00:48:49.420" style="s2">for each week or each each one and cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.140" end="00:48:54.350" style="s2">don&#39;t even know I like how to even</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.420" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">assess his software when we&#39;re not on it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.350" end="00:48:57.740" style="s2">right is it just a Google Doc and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:48:59.330" style="s2">just formats it better because we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.740" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">to log in to be able to use it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.330" end="00:49:04.100" style="s2">two degrees away anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:05.990" style="s2">whereas with people that got one minute</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.100" end="00:49:08.950" style="s2">per person that&#39;s that&#39;s just for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.990" end="00:49:12.710" style="s2">video meeting everything else is free</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.950" end="00:49:18.770" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s and that&#39;s because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.710" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">what what zoom charges him he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.770" end="00:49:23.480" style="s2">passing on the costs yeah no I mean zoom</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">does has to have the free thing but</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.480" end="00:49:28.340" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the the cost of using the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.290" style="s2">zoom video conferencing in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.340" end="00:49:31.730" style="s2">background so all the other stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.290" end="00:49:33.530" style="s2">documents and the searching and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.730" end="00:49:36.770" style="s2">everything should be built in I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.530" end="00:49:41.540" style="s2">think it does Auto transcribing but it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.770" end="00:49:43.400" style="s2">does have some community tools like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.540" end="00:49:48.250" style="s2">hundred people on a zoom call which you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.400" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">get for $15 a month would be 10 how many</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.250" end="00:49:53.900" style="s2">someone do that math for me 100 cents</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:56.090" style="s2">one dollar a dollar a minute right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.900" end="00:49:58.430" style="s2">like sixty dollars for an hour which for</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.090" end="00:50:03.020" style="s2">an organization isn&#39;t a lot but for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.430" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">non-profit starting out is like for</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.020" end="00:50:06.560" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s game B and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:08.270" style="s2">looking like why he gets charged two</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.560" end="00:50:10.610" style="s2">cent per minute when he can&#39;t like why</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.270" end="00:50:12.860" style="s2">is there not why can&#39;t he just use bunch</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.610" end="00:50:14.020" style="s2">of free zoom accounts not free sorry $15</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.860" end="00:50:17.240" style="s2">a month</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.020" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">well you can&#39;t do the integrations that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.240" end="00:50:21.230" style="s2">he has with it and some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:23.210" style="s2">stuff and controlling it so he has yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.230" end="00:50:26.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just that&#39;s the way they charge it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.210" end="00:50:29.210" style="s2">but most people don&#39;t use it so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.980" end="00:50:30.320" style="s2">you&#39;re getting reduced costs because</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.210" end="00:50:31.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a hundred people although the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.320" end="00:50:35.270" style="s2">have a zoom account and use it for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.820" end="00:50:37.010" style="s2">couple meetings a month so yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.270" end="00:50:42.830" style="s2">just averaging the cost of our larger</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.010" end="00:50:44.690" style="s2">group yeah so it might the way the</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.830" end="00:50:47.300" style="s2">pricing works although I think if we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.690" end="00:50:49.070" style="s2">if the members if if everyone if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.300" end="00:50:53.210" style="s2">mint we could get everyone to pay three</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.070" end="00:50:55.580" style="s2">dollars a month then we could use it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.210" end="00:50:58.100" style="s2">maybe that that could even be the start</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.580" end="00:50:59.000" style="s2">of together tech it&#39;s like okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.100" end="00:51:01.130" style="s2">first thing we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.000" end="00:51:02.660" style="s2">gonna instead of being $10 a month we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.130" end="00:51:04.610" style="s2">going to start at $3 a month for this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.660" end="00:51:08.750" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it but</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.610" end="00:51:13.010" style="s2">it&#39;s just an option it&#39;s got some</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.750" end="00:51:19.580" style="s2">interesting features here some visual</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.010" end="00:51:26.510" style="s2">problem mapping and yeah calendar a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.580" end="00:51:28.100" style="s2">of stuff check it out let&#39;s see I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.510" end="00:51:29.720" style="s2">it solves all of our problems and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.100" end="00:51:31.570" style="s2">$3 a month the other option is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.720" end="00:51:33.500" style="s2">actually pay $10 a month</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.570" end="00:51:36.980" style="s2">figure it out into a pool and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.500" end="00:51:38.870" style="s2">payout that and then when people come</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.980" end="00:51:40.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.870" end="00:51:43.460" style="s2">four of us with together tech at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.280" end="00:51:45.410" style="s2">moment and even that week I just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.460" end="00:51:47.120" style="s2">like include you onus NHL we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.410" end="00:51:48.530" style="s2">actually like kind of called but like if</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.120" end="00:51:50.420" style="s2">you&#39;ll put in ten dollars a month in and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.530" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">we have enough space to invite people to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.420" end="00:51:53.780" style="s2">not pay right and then when they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:55.900" style="s2">start getting actually involved it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.780" end="00:51:59.290" style="s2">like by the way it&#39;s $10 a month to have</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.900" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">voting rights and to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.290" end="00:52:06.110" style="s2">maybe more more elite conversations to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:07.190" style="s2">be one of that I&#39;d like tiered like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.110" end="00:52:08.210" style="s2">do have more skin in the game when</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.190" end="00:52:10.510" style="s2">you&#39;re actually paying into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.210" end="00:52:15.080" style="s2">co-operative than when you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.510" end="00:52:16.250" style="s2">participating then I guess the point</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.080" end="00:52:20.780" style="s2">where if we in order mean if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.250" end="00:52:23.150" style="s2">spending $3,000 a month on who coach at</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.780" end="00:52:25.070" style="s2">then one we can see the metrics does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.150" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">make sense to just have it per one cent</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.070" end="00:52:28.900" style="s2">per person and or</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:33.650" style="s2">what&#39;s the point where we make our own</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.900" end="00:52:36.140" style="s2">using zoom that you know it&#39;s cheaper to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.650" end="00:52:37.880" style="s2">make it than to pay someone else and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.140" end="00:52:39.770" style="s2">having that conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.880" end="00:52:41.690" style="s2">founder like this is cheaper how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.770" end="00:52:43.220" style="s2">integrate all of this together but again</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.690" end="00:52:48.109" style="s2">whole other conversation we have 8</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.220" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">minutes left so yeah so do we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.109" end="00:52:55.220" style="s2">ahead and create some text for how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:57.290" style="s2">describe this and put it out there and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.220" end="00:53:02.990" style="s2">see people or I said who wants to do all</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.290" end="00:53:04.609" style="s2">that work I&#39;m willing to post it if if</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.990" end="00:53:06.619" style="s2">someone else is going to type it up or</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.609" end="00:53:08.060" style="s2">I&#39;m also totally that with anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.619" end="00:53:09.530" style="s2">posted yet sometimes I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.060" end="00:53:11.450" style="s2">whether the algorithm is gonna be for me</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.530" end="00:53:13.790" style="s2">because I post more or unfavorably</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.450" end="00:53:16.190" style="s2">because I post more like way to people</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.790" end="00:53:21.380" style="s2">to be what I put it for not I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.190" end="00:53:25.190" style="s2">I can type out what we came up with here</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.380" end="00:53:27.380" style="s2">and then we can decide and do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.190" end="00:53:30.349" style="s2">just give a time like zoom account this</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.380" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">time who&#39;s interested and collect</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.349" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">information and send it out all the ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:36.550" style="s2">that&#39;s also the Martin post it is people</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">that contact you to get the links to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.550" end="00:53:43.490" style="s2">that right yeah I guess so worst case we</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:46.430" style="s2">can all just have part three of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.490" end="00:53:50.599" style="s2">discussion if no one else shows up right</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.430" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say what went wrong yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.599" end="00:53:55.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know Edward if you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:53:58.280" style="s2">could just start a Google Doc and share</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.640" end="00:54:00.920" style="s2">it with us on the Facebook channel and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.280" end="00:54:03.050" style="s2">and then you could put down your text</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.920" end="00:54:06.170" style="s2">and we can come in and make suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.050" end="00:54:07.640" style="s2">if you want yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s start there</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.170" end="00:54:09.579" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good place to start</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.640" end="00:54:12.440" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.579" end="00:54:15.020" style="s2">join make a chat he&#39;s starting our fix</p>

<p begin="00:54:18.290" end="00:54:23.450" style="s2">another group that&#39;s brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">brainstorming or do you want to go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.450" end="00:54:30.619" style="s2">and make one for this for the project</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:32.030" style="s2">raising the issue with that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.619" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">guess but then it&#39;s gonna go out to</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.030" end="00:54:35.150" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s part of a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:36.680" style="s2">right like people don&#39;t necessarily keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.150" end="00:54:38.390" style="s2">coming back just because they have their</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.680" end="00:54:39.210" style="s2">project raised or just a whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.390" end="00:54:41.849" style="s2">conversation</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.849" end="00:54:44.940" style="s2">is gonna be very similar to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">doing it&#39;s just instead of people having</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.940" end="00:54:51.059" style="s2">projects it&#39;s gonna be individual to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">project and how many times do you come</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.059" end="00:54:55.829" style="s2">and raise someone else before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:59.130" style="s2">raised right like you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.829" end="00:55:01.349" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas and butts in the seat to</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.130" end="00:55:03.869" style="s2">be part of it and if you&#39;re only taking</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.349" end="00:55:04.380" style="s2">or not giving what is what does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.869" end="00:55:07.800" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.380" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">or do we care yeah if you don&#39;t mind to</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.800" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">just make a quick facebook chat group</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:17.640" style="s2">and everyone can show the link yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:22.740" style="s2">that&#39;s alone yeah doesn&#39;t take much time</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.640" end="00:55:24.930" style="s2">or much space right yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.740" end="00:55:34.829" style="s2">getting started and doing something and</p>

<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:50.220" style="s2">the limit but actually it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.940" end="00:55:51.630" style="s2">much better than having one off ones and</p>
