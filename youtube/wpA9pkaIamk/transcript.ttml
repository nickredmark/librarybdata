<p begin="00:01:50.299" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">they obviously aren&#39;t when we practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.920" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">Idiot compassion we trade intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:03.890" style="s2">and care for drama and false gestures we</p>

<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:04.859" style="s2">idiot compassion also occurs when care</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.409" end="00:03:06.989" style="s2">is professionalized to the extreme when</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.859" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">we no longer care for individuals but</p>
