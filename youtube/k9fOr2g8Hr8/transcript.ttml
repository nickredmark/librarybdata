<p begin="00:00:00.050" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">so the critical thing about the eco</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.030" end="00:00:08.040" style="s2">village movement is that it represents a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:10.410" style="s2">global experiment in sustainability so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.040" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">these are the people who on these little</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.410" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">projects and communities all over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">world are actually doing what everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">else advocates but doesn&#39;t do in</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">universities and government agencies and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.609" end="00:00:24.510" style="s2">United Nations it&#39;s all doing reports</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">about sustainability and all the things</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.510" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">we ought to do and how we ought to live</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">in order to basically you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">ameliorate climate change and create a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">sustainable society but who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">out on the frontier and the Eco village</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">movement is a network of communities</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">that have been doing this for 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">taken together then they cut they</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">basically comprise a global experiment</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">in sustainability that&#39;s been going for</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">three decades because of that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2">incredible learning incredible wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">that has been told now and is now being</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.949" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">brought together and offered to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">world through the guy education program</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">for example of the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">network which is a training that draws</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">on the wisdom that has been garnered in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">these communities about 80 communities</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">in 20 countries over the last three</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">decades so this is a really critical</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">moment for our civilization as we as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:22.670" style="s2">grope for solutions to some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">intractable environmental problems and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.670" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">the global eco village network is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">network of communities that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">up with those solutions in very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">practical and integral ways the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">key feature about these communities is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">that they address so many features of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:40.380" style="s2">our global crisis in one integral</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:42.150" style="s2">solution for example they address the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.380" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">ecological issues they address economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.150" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">issues they address social issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">providing much more of a community life</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">and a solution to the alienation that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">people tend to experience in urban</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">industrial cultures they reclaim a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">sustainable village life they address</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">gender issues between women and men all</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">of these different issues are integrated</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">so you know traditionally the the major</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">institutions of our society like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">United Nations for example they have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">Department of the Environment you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:13.030" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:14.769" style="s2">and then they have the social summit</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.030" end="00:02:16.900" style="s2">they had in Copenhagen then they had the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.769" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">Women&#39;s Conference in Beijing and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:21.909" style="s2">had the the environmental summit in Rio</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:24.280" style="s2">de Janeiro and in a certain sense what</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.909" end="00:02:26.349" style="s2">eco villages do is they integrate all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.280" end="00:02:29.109" style="s2">these different agendas into practical</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.349" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">integral solutions on the ground now</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.109" end="00:02:33.099" style="s2">they&#39;re not a utopia there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.349" style="s2">failings there&#39;s a lot of learning but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.099" end="00:02:38.829" style="s2">they point the way to the future and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.349" end="00:02:41.549" style="s2">such they are beacons of hope for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.829" end="00:02:41.549" style="s2">future of humanity</p>
