<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:11.380" style="s2">Jamie so we did an interview about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.400" end="00:00:14.290" style="s2">year ago now and it wasn&#39;t interview I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.380" end="00:00:15.940" style="s2">was expecting because you stealing fire</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.290" end="00:00:18.670" style="s2">had come out - a couple of years ago now</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.940" end="00:00:22.869" style="s2">all about flow state transformational</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.670" end="00:00:24.310" style="s2">culture and what I was expecting was an</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.869" end="00:00:26.109" style="s2">interview about kind of the value of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.310" end="00:00:28.570" style="s2">transformational culture and kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.109" end="00:00:30.039" style="s2">flow states are essential for evolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.570" end="00:00:31.900" style="s2">and all of the stuff that isn&#39;t stealing</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.039" end="00:00:33.460" style="s2">fire and what you actually did was</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.900" end="00:00:35.950" style="s2">poured a kind of big bucket of cold</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.460" end="00:00:38.590" style="s2">water all over that idea and just said</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.950" end="00:00:40.030" style="s2">hang on whoa whoa whoa whoa we need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.590" end="00:00:41.620" style="s2">be careful because we&#39;ve got all of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.030" end="00:00:44.380" style="s2">these tools but we&#39;re not using them</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.620" end="00:00:45.640" style="s2">properly and it looks like we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.380" end="00:00:47.050" style="s2">to make some of the same mistakes that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.640" end="00:00:49.540" style="s2">everyone&#39;s always made with these</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.050" end="00:00:50.829" style="s2">technologies how have you changed in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.540" end="00:00:53.140" style="s2">last sort of year since we spoke last</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.829" end="00:00:55.300" style="s2">time yeah I mean I would love to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.140" end="00:00:56.920" style="s2">that was just you know whistling past</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.300" end="00:00:59.530" style="s2">the graveyard moment but no I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.920" end="00:01:02.079" style="s2">actually far more pessimistic and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.530" end="00:01:03.489" style="s2">concerned actually in ways that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:04.600" style="s2">even anticipate coming out of stealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.489" end="00:01:07.810" style="s2">fire they were there was some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.600" end="00:01:09.340" style="s2">obvious known issues that in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.810" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">documenting of hey there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.340" end="00:01:12.429" style="s2">revolution in non-ordinary states and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:14.350" style="s2">not just flow States but you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.429" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">meditation and smart tech and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.350" end="00:01:18.310" style="s2">psychedelics and kind of just pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:20.409" style="s2">much every way in you can imagine people</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.310" end="00:01:22.149" style="s2">are starting to crack that code and put</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.409" end="00:01:25.060" style="s2">those things together combine them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.149" end="00:01:27.789" style="s2">do all sorts of things and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.060" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">I&#39;d laid out three potential sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.789" end="00:01:33.579" style="s2">known pitfall areas the first was</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:37.659" style="s2">commodification the idea that being able</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.579" end="00:01:39.759" style="s2">to hack our neural chemistry are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.659" end="00:01:42.459" style="s2">the biology of bliss that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:45.130" style="s2">used to sell us more and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.459" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">100% you know hasn&#39;t is in increasing</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.130" end="00:01:49.869" style="s2">quantities and the move into vrn AR and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:51.009" style="s2">algorithmic social media and all those</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.869" end="00:01:52.899" style="s2">kind of things is pretty well-documented</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.009" end="00:01:55.929" style="s2">most folks are actually more aware of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.899" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">that now and it&#39;s happening anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.929" end="00:02:02.409" style="s2">other words weaponization then saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:04.869" style="s2">hey state actors with massive budgets</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.409" end="00:02:07.090" style="s2">are super interested in super soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.869" end="00:02:09.700" style="s2">and super interested in everything from</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.090" end="00:02:11.590" style="s2">mind control to performance enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.700" end="00:02:12.970" style="s2">that this whole range and again you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.590" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">has been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.970" end="00:02:17.530" style="s2">half-century plus and is simply we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">just predict it would continue but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.530" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">third one was sort of our own worst</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">interest are the hedonism and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.850" end="00:02:28.750" style="s2">element what he that element has shown</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">up far more virulent Lee than anything I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.750" end="00:02:32.470" style="s2">sort of anticipated and it really does</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.660" style="s2">feel that the sort of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.470" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">Renaissance or the stealing fire</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.660" end="00:02:38.020" style="s2">revolution whatever I want to call it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:40.510" style="s2">really just showing up as a Children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.020" end="00:02:44.440" style="s2">Crusade these days and there&#39;s an awful</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.510" end="00:02:47.140" style="s2">lot of people kind of rushing in and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.440" end="00:02:49.240" style="s2">are actually you know finding ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.140" end="00:02:52.420" style="s2">a being led by people who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.240" end="00:02:54.670" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing be in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">the steepest part I&#39;ve kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.670" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">that got in a research groups hype cycle</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:01.570" style="s2">idea that you know there&#39;s the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:04.240" style="s2">the peak of expectations followed by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.570" end="00:03:06.280" style="s2">trough of disillusionment and then you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.240" end="00:03:07.660" style="s2">know over time you kind of slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.280" end="00:03:10.060" style="s2">gradually get back to what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.660" end="00:03:12.370" style="s2">gonna be the steady state promise and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.060" end="00:03:14.110" style="s2">delivery of any given movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.370" end="00:03:16.540" style="s2">technology etc and so I think we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.110" end="00:03:20.050" style="s2">literally almost at the high point and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.540" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2">just teetering on the brink of the crash</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.050" end="00:03:27.580" style="s2">which I would probably timestamp as</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">anytime in the next 18 to 36 months we</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.580" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2">would anticipate a collapse along a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">series of kind of fairly predictable</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">vectors and what do you think that crash</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">is gonna look like well I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:42.550" style="s2">you can take it probably macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:45.940" style="s2">medical professional and then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.550" end="00:03:47.980" style="s2">social and so speaking that now if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.940" end="00:03:50.680" style="s2">can a narrow the focus from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.980" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">over a broad revolution in ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.680" end="00:03:53.350" style="s2">techniques and technologies and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:55.660" style="s2">kind of thing he likes actually get down</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.350" end="00:03:56.830" style="s2">to specifically you know what Michael</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.660" end="00:03:58.300" style="s2">Pollan is written about is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.830" end="00:03:59.470" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance what its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.300" end="00:04:02.890" style="s2">you know really bubbling to the surface</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.470" end="00:04:07.410" style="s2">these days the first is it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.890" end="00:04:09.459" style="s2">to look anything like what the early</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.410" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">revolutionaries ambassadors and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.459" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">advocates hoped or wished and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">just kind of table stakes things never</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">do you know if Benjamin Franklin and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:18.640" style="s2">Thomas Jefferson looked at the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:20.830" style="s2">election they&#39;d be like what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.640" end="00:04:22.310" style="s2">everliving just happened right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.830" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">even</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.639" style="s2">you were an idealist from back at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.230" end="00:04:58.790" style="s2">inception of that thing you would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.639" end="00:05:00.680" style="s2">this is an utter corruption mutation</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.790" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">this is not what we thought or what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.680" end="00:05:05.389" style="s2">wanted but on the other hand Whole Foods</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:07.310" style="s2">at least prior to Amazon acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.389" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">right Whole Foods has been an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.310" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">global market maker in organic foods and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:15.080" style="s2">additional companies like Trader Joe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:17.330" style="s2">like Costco even Walmart is now that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.080" end="00:05:20.090" style="s2">the largest private label organic brands</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.330" end="00:05:22.700" style="s2">none of that would have happened were it</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.700" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">concurred into the thing it you know one</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">of the inception could have seen so just</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:31.820" style="s2">as a general premise whatever this turns</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:35.000" style="s2">out to be it is probably not gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.820" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">anything like people at boom fest or</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.000" end="00:05:40.750" style="s2">people at Burning Man or even the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">of you know elders of the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.750" end="00:05:45.080" style="s2">movements would have imagined hoped</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:35.089" style="s2">sphere as well and and so the narcissism</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.380" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">could make a fairly clear case that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.389" end="00:16:30.050" style="s2">we&#39;re in that neck of the woods with</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.789" style="s2">and what&#39;s what&#39;s been happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.289" end="00:19:30.049" style="s2">last few years you really know this</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.789" end="00:19:30.529" style="s2">is just the Museum of ice cream in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.049" end="00:19:33.110" style="s2">desert</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.529" end="00:19:35.179" style="s2">people are just literally coming up to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.110" end="00:19:37.460" style="s2">up not not interacting with it as humans</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.179" end="00:19:39.889" style="s2">not not allowing themselves to be moved</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.460" end="00:19:42.399" style="s2">or transformed by it but literally just</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.889" end="00:19:46.100" style="s2">using those backdrops for their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.399" end="00:19:47.240" style="s2">social media profile so digital</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.100" end="00:19:49.549" style="s2">Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.240" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">has overlaid with the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.549" end="00:19:54.380" style="s2">Renaissance in ways that is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:56.299" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like that cut Vonnegut</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.380" end="00:19:58.010" style="s2">but cat&#39;s cradle you know where I sign</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.299" end="00:19:59.570" style="s2">is that weird molecule that can freeze</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.010" end="00:20:01.340" style="s2">all of all water molecules on the earth</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.570" end="00:20:04.870" style="s2">and basically end life right and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.340" end="00:20:08.390" style="s2">almost feels like it&#39;s digitally fuel</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.870" end="00:20:12.610" style="s2">psychedelic Gnosticism is like ice 9 it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.390" end="00:20:14.840" style="s2">is just encasing our world in super egos</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.610" end="00:20:18.409" style="s2">faster than we can actually melt them</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.840" end="00:20:21.309" style="s2">and that&#39;s horrifying you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.409" end="00:20:23.960" style="s2">there&#39;s like these are arguably the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.309" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">powerful tools that humans have ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.960" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">assembled</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:29.510" style="s2">to get out of ourselves and yet these</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:31.100" style="s2">other tools we&#39;ve built all right which</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.510" end="00:20:33.950" style="s2">leaves us in the echo chambers of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:36.830" style="s2">ourselves have actually co-opted that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.950" end="00:20:40.700" style="s2">enterprise and so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.830" end="00:20:42.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a horrific thing the next is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.700" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">kind of hedonism which is again</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.500" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">permission with with the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.299" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">Renaissance with all the profound work</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:48.679" style="s2">that&#39;s happening with maps and Imperial</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:51.409" style="s2">College and a lot of the other folks</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.679" end="00:20:54.220" style="s2">that are just heads down doing an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.409" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">amazingly ethical principled work in</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.220" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">service of the people who are hung out</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:01.279" style="s2">to dry I mean the people who are just</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.279" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">anxiety and depression and suicidal</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:09.470" style="s2">out of out of options there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.100" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">profound and beautiful work and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.470" end="00:21:15.250" style="s2">and we wrote about it in stealing fire</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:18.500" style="s2">the idea that one two three sessions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.250" end="00:21:22.279" style="s2">mdma-assisted therapy for instance can</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.500" end="00:21:23.480" style="s2">just profoundly take a load off somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.279" end="00:21:25.720" style="s2">who&#39;s been carrying those buttons</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.480" end="00:21:29.210" style="s2">themselves without help without relief</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.720" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">it&#39;s beautifully uplifting but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.210" end="00:21:36.559" style="s2">reality is is that 33 or 303 sessions</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:38.390" style="s2">you know off-label done on my own time</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.559" end="00:21:41.539" style="s2">done recreationally or even with an</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.909" end="00:21:50.870" style="s2">transformers that people have done it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.260" end="00:21:53.929" style="s2">once or three times and so my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.870" end="00:21:55.399" style="s2">is that there&#39;s increased permission you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.929" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">know that because science I&#39;m micro</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:04.820" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sort of absolution of well</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:06.860" style="s2">are we making the most of it are we</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.820" end="00:22:09.380" style="s2">integrating this is this actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.860" end="00:22:12.230" style="s2">leaving me a better person or are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.380" end="00:22:14.809" style="s2">just different bright lights to go chase</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.230" end="00:22:18.950" style="s2">is this just a novelty is this just</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.809" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">chemically-induced well-being that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.950" end="00:22:24.769" style="s2">fleeting and we&#39;re not actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:26.769" style="s2">the work around it and the final one is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.769" end="00:22:30.140" style="s2">just commercialism or commodification</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.769" end="00:22:32.269" style="s2">which kind of is the first to the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.140" end="00:22:34.940" style="s2">narcissism plus the hedonism plus</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.269" end="00:22:37.279" style="s2">commercialism which is the idea that in</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.940" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">this age of you know anyone can be an</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.279" end="00:22:41.240" style="s2">expert and all you need to do is publish</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:42.620" style="s2">an e-book and set up a blog and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.240" end="00:22:44.210" style="s2">put out and put out a shingle and have</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.620" end="00:22:49.340" style="s2">an evite and see you see what Guppies</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.210" end="00:22:52.630" style="s2">come there is this the disconnect</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.650" end="00:25:14.030" style="s2">a ton of that as well so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.870" end="00:25:16.010" style="s2">those are just the factors I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.030" end="00:25:18.980" style="s2">you know and and and I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.010" end="00:25:22.160" style="s2">that I mean a they&#39;re all already</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.980" end="00:25:22.450" style="s2">happening so none of this is sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.160" end="00:25:25.730" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.450" end="00:25:27.080" style="s2">Cassandra you know magining worse</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.730" end="00:25:29.690" style="s2">scenarios are saying well what if that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.080" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">happens these are all already happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.690" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">the question is just where do they lead</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:38.860" style="s2">us lots to pick up on the one thing from</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:41.210" style="s2">from earlier you mentioned that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.860" end="00:25:44.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of bifurcation where</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:46.460" style="s2">medicine is looking for the the medical</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.480" end="00:25:48.800" style="s2">effect while not being interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.460" end="00:25:50.600" style="s2">the psychedelic effect a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.800" end="00:25:52.280" style="s2">in the psychedelic medicine space would</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.600" end="00:25:54.680" style="s2">say that the those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.280" end="00:25:56.570" style="s2">together like the the especially was for</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.680" end="00:25:58.250" style="s2">example psychedelic mushrooms that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.570" end="00:26:00.530" style="s2">feeling of oneness that internal</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.250" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">subjective effect is the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.530" end="00:26:03.950" style="s2">effect so with most of them that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.210" end="00:26:06.530" style="s2">going to be possible is it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.950" end="00:26:09.140" style="s2">disassociate to to bifurcate those two</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:12.560" style="s2">things yeah and I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.140" end="00:26:15.230" style="s2">it&#39;s great that a number of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.560" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">therapists that are working in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.230" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">space are actually and somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">strangely within Western clinical</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:24.710" style="s2">medicine courageously saying it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">of these interior experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.710" end="00:26:27.400" style="s2">actually valuable and we need to notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.400" end="00:26:34.330" style="s2">and build our protocols around them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:37.990" style="s2">the question will simply be to what</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.330" end="00:26:41.110" style="s2">extent does that persist here&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.990" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">with large pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.110" end="00:26:45.970" style="s2">tweaking molecules they&#39;re good that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:48.600" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a messy aberration the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.970" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">interior subjective experience is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.600" end="00:26:54.250" style="s2">clinically controllable and manageable</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:56.140" style="s2">so wherever possible and this is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.250" end="00:26:57.730" style="s2">know as we&#39;ve seen with epidemics right</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.140" end="00:26:59.500" style="s2">here&#39;s a cannabinoid rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.730" end="00:27:01.540" style="s2">like here&#39;s cannabis that grows out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.500" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">the ground or grows in a greenhouse and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.540" end="00:27:06.730" style="s2">it works they&#39;re like oh get away that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:09.460" style="s2">pesky hi let&#39;s isolate it isolate</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.730" end="00:27:12.280" style="s2">isolate it to do the one thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.460" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">disease case that we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.280" end="00:27:19.330" style="s2">for chop it all up repackage it rebrand</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">it and mock it up so that will be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.330" end="00:27:23.590" style="s2">question as to how long that persists</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:25.300" style="s2">does that now grow because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.590" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">actually the truth of the matter which</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.300" end="00:27:29.050" style="s2">is that majority of the healing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:31.210" style="s2">actually changing my relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.050" end="00:27:34.059" style="s2">myself and to my narratives and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.210" end="00:27:36.870" style="s2">happening on a neurochemical and even</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.059" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">neuroplastic level are the structural</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.870" end="00:27:42.130" style="s2">correlates to that change or are we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:45.100" style="s2">gonna try and wring out those those</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.130" end="00:27:47.620" style="s2">known side-effects to create a more</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.100" end="00:27:49.000" style="s2">manageable process in the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.620" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">industrial medicine thing so that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.000" end="00:27:53.530" style="s2">know tbv</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:54.790" style="s2">but obviously you know full hats off to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.530" end="00:27:57.550" style="s2">the folks that are taking a stand for</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.790" end="00:28:00.460" style="s2">that and I know that some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.550" end="00:28:02.020" style="s2">so I&#39;ve done quite a few pieces about</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.460" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">psychedelic medicine over quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.020" end="00:28:07.179" style="s2">years and I know that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:09.370" style="s2">been a sense of this tension between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.179" end="00:28:11.410" style="s2">scientific model and the experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.370" end="00:28:14.370" style="s2">itself and I know that some people even</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.410" end="00:28:18.400" style="s2">within psychedelic medicine are having</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.370" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">their torn because they&#39;re thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.400" end="00:28:22.030" style="s2">we have an idea and some of the results</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">that have come out from the latest one</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.030" end="00:28:26.890" style="s2">in the UK was Robin Carhartt Harris a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:29.290" style="s2">lot of the the people who went through</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.890" end="00:28:30.910" style="s2">it had a they were relieved of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.290" end="00:28:32.950" style="s2">symptoms of depression for sort of three</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.910" end="00:28:35.620" style="s2">months at a time but then it would it</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.950" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">would often come back and this sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.620" end="00:28:40.330" style="s2">everyone who&#39;s taken psychedelics kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">of knows that yeah we get this after go</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.330" end="00:28:42.970" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:45.670" style="s2">you have to put in some changes to your</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.970" end="00:28:47.500" style="s2">lifestyle or changes to your your your</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.670" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">lived experience in those three months</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.500" end="00:28:51.790" style="s2">if they&#39;re going to be sustainable so</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:54.660" style="s2">people are being forced into a medical</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.790" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">model that maybe is not helpful to them</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.660" end="00:28:58.270" style="s2">creating meaningful change in their</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:00.940" style="s2">lives and meaningful change for their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.270" end="00:29:03.370" style="s2">conditions yeah I mean if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:04.570" style="s2">most kind of extreme boundary case I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.370" end="00:29:05.950" style="s2">think of which is something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:08.740" style="s2">psychedelic like five Meo</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.950" end="00:29:10.300" style="s2">DMT which is you know arguably and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.740" end="00:29:11.860" style="s2">don&#39;t think many people actually argue</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.300" end="00:29:13.810" style="s2">this is you know the most potent</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.860" end="00:29:16.510" style="s2">compound that humans have ever had</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.810" end="00:29:18.940" style="s2">access to and you come across folks who</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.510" end="00:29:20.590" style="s2">have anecdotally had you know one</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.940" end="00:29:21.850" style="s2">experience three experiences five</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.590" end="00:29:23.730" style="s2">experiences and I&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.850" end="00:29:26.650" style="s2">watching over the last five years like</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.730" end="00:29:28.780" style="s2">and.and you know people come back you</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.650" end="00:29:31.240" style="s2">know hair on fire for you know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.780" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">amazing exposure to what some people</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.240" end="00:29:37.810" style="s2">just say is literally unmitigated you</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.850" end="00:30:19.960" style="s2">I think and should put the rest of it in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.280" end="00:30:23.050" style="s2">context which is is if you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.960" end="00:30:24.970" style="s2">go to developmental psychology you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.050" end="00:30:26.620" style="s2">see Bob Keegan at Harvard University</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.660" end="00:30:51.220" style="s2">know what going up we&#39;re going to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.700" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">waterfall with thimbles so in some</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.220" end="00:30:55.460" style="s2">respects the the access</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:57.560" style="s2">of information that typically comes</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:30:59.420" style="s2">through in a psychedelic state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.560" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">only there&#39;s only a fraction of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.420" end="00:31:04.010" style="s2">that we actually can sort of bring back</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:05.570" style="s2">into our waking state consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.010" end="00:31:07.700" style="s2">into our lives and in fact sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.570" end="00:31:11.030" style="s2">it&#39;s contraindicated that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.700" end="00:31:13.400" style="s2">point getting lobbed to a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.030" end="00:31:16.780" style="s2">thousand feet if you can only breathe</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.400" end="00:31:19.580" style="s2">down to the first twenty to 26,000 feet</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.780" end="00:31:21.710" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of overshooting the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.580" end="00:31:25.430" style="s2">mark of what can I translate into my</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.710" end="00:31:27.590" style="s2">life and then there&#39;s often a lack of as</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.430" end="00:31:32.030" style="s2">you said you know the hard dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.590" end="00:31:34.730" style="s2">work of integration that particularly</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.030" end="00:31:37.640" style="s2">when it&#39;s so much more tempting to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.730" end="00:31:39.770" style="s2">back to the Wishing Well right versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.640" end="00:31:41.630" style="s2">doing the shitty hard stuff and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.770" end="00:31:43.280" style="s2">people are often neglecting that even</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.630" end="00:31:45.290" style="s2">more when they have these quick little</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.280" end="00:31:47.210" style="s2">bypasses if I can only get to that place</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.290" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">after two decades of meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.210" end="00:31:51.740" style="s2">for instance it&#39;s slow it&#39;s distractive</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">no one&#39;s got time for that these days</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.740" end="00:31:55.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole lot of reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">traditional monastic practices or</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.790" end="00:32:02.750" style="s2">martial practices may or may not fit</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:04.010" style="s2">perfectly with pell-mell 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.750" end="00:32:06.020" style="s2">society but they had some checks and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.010" end="00:32:08.630" style="s2">balances in them and you had to have</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.020" end="00:32:10.430" style="s2">prepared the vessel before you pour it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.630" end="00:32:12.200" style="s2">in the sort of water of life now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.430" end="00:32:15.680" style="s2">just swimming splashing around and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.200" end="00:32:17.930" style="s2">spilling tons because anybody can get</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.680" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">there with very little effort and as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.930" end="00:32:24.170" style="s2">result and we&#39;re not balancing it with</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:26.120" style="s2">the with the work afterwards what do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.170" end="00:32:28.730" style="s2">think about the the mix between the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.120" end="00:32:30.890" style="s2">scientific model and psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.730" end="00:32:33.980" style="s2">research it seems like an awkward fit</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.890" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">however you spin it sure I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.980" end="00:32:37.460" style="s2">you end up with sort of pee hacking and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:40.160" style="s2">placebo effects you know so basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.460" end="00:32:43.160" style="s2">the idea that double-blind</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.160" end="00:32:44.630" style="s2">placebo-controlled studies I mean eight</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.160" end="00:32:46.400" style="s2">don&#39;t work that well in psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.630" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">because you really know in a heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.400" end="00:32:50.120" style="s2">whether you&#39;ve got the fake one or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:51.620" style="s2">real one and so even when they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.120" end="00:32:53.270" style="s2">you know like take niacin instead of</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.620" end="00:32:54.890" style="s2">psilocybin so you get kind of a flushing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.270" end="00:32:59.020" style="s2">and a tingling but no psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.890" end="00:33:02.560" style="s2">effects it&#39;s pretty hard to cram</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.020" end="00:33:05.570" style="s2">psychedelic research into that specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.560" end="00:33:08.200" style="s2">pharmaceutical trials model the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.570" end="00:33:08.200" style="s2">element is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.330" end="00:33:16.679" style="s2">the interior subjective experiences</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.940" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">which are arguably a large chunk of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.679" end="00:33:21.450" style="s2">value and impact of these things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:23.129" style="s2">subject themselves to controlled</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.450" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">measurement you can do subjective</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.129" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">analysis and surveys and things but</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:29.340" style="s2">again what are you tracking are you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">tracking like a mystical state inventory</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.340" end="00:33:32.879" style="s2">okay what wild-ass crazy did I see</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.909" style="s2">while I was there okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.879" end="00:33:38.999" style="s2">useful but not definitive are we</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.909" end="00:33:41.460" style="s2">discussing behavioral change shift in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.999" end="00:33:43.950" style="s2">adult developmental complexity if so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:46.619" style="s2">that stuff doesn&#39;t often change that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.950" end="00:33:48.359" style="s2">fast or if it does momentarily have kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.619" end="00:33:50.340" style="s2">of a an off to glow effect it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.359" end="00:33:52.139" style="s2">return fairly close to baseline and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.340" end="00:33:54.889" style="s2">you&#39;re really Nikken you can pick things</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.139" end="00:33:58.590" style="s2">up like long-term stage development</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.889" end="00:34:02.039" style="s2">maybe in a six month window but usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.590" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">it&#39;s 12 18 36 months or longer to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.039" end="00:34:07.769" style="s2">see the arc if someone growing up as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:09.480" style="s2">adult and so our tools and our timelines</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.769" end="00:34:11.549" style="s2">just clinical trial and how long were</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.480" end="00:34:13.799" style="s2">you in them don&#39;t don&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.549" end="00:34:16.079" style="s2">submit to that and if it&#39;s a multi</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.799" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">variable equation that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.079" end="00:34:20.129" style="s2">transformation which is I mean even just</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:21.450" style="s2">take it out of the labs what what</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.129" end="00:34:24.030" style="s2">happens where somebody might have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.450" end="00:34:26.579" style="s2">epiphany you might be in the rainforest</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.030" end="00:34:28.230" style="s2">with an indigenous shaman traveling out</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.579" end="00:34:29.190" style="s2">of your country out of your language out</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.230" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">of your comfort zone different</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.190" end="00:34:34.260" style="s2">bioregions all those things combining to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:35.819" style="s2">have the ayahuasca experience you had or</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.260" end="00:34:36.899" style="s2">if you&#39;re at a transformational festival</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.819" end="00:34:38.339" style="s2">and there&#39;s light in this sound and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.899" end="00:34:39.629" style="s2">there&#39;s music and there&#39;s companionship</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.339" end="00:34:41.190" style="s2">and those are these things and a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.629" end="00:34:43.859" style="s2">psychedelic compound and it was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.190" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">entire thing that of that evening or</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.859" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">that day or that week or whatever was</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:50.220" style="s2">that cracks you have been how do we back</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:53.059" style="s2">all those things out and so my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.220" end="00:34:56.010" style="s2">is that we probably need different</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.059" end="00:34:57.240" style="s2">research protocols if we&#39;re really going</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.010" end="00:34:58.170" style="s2">to try and sort of F the ineffable if</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.240" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to really try and pin down</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.170" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">what is the juju or what is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:05.940" style="s2">transformational magic and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:07.799" style="s2">both understand it better and help more</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.940" end="00:35:10.230" style="s2">of it happen more healthily for more</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.799" end="00:35:13.589" style="s2">people it would almost be the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:17.730" style="s2">the kitchen sink method which is figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.589" end="00:35:19.110" style="s2">out all the factors that for sure crack</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:21.690" style="s2">people wide open</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.110" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">study that and then you just can back</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.690" end="00:35:28.680" style="s2">off back off individual elements until</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2">you get an undesired drop-off in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.680" end="00:35:35.400" style="s2">efficacy and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:39.060" style="s2">way of doing it but I think we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.400" end="00:35:42.840" style="s2">can&#39;t think that atomizing elements and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.060" end="00:35:45.420" style="s2">measuring them in isolation ever adds up</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.840" end="00:35:47.160" style="s2">to the mystery we might need to start</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.420" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">with the things that we know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.160" end="00:35:53.880" style="s2">deliver glimpses of the numinous and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">then we know those are there and then we</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.880" end="00:35:58.050" style="s2">can start figuring out you know reverse</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:00.810" style="s2">engineering or sort of almost regression</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.050" end="00:36:03.090" style="s2">analysis what were the elements that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.810" end="00:36:05.910" style="s2">were overwhelmingly contributed versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.090" end="00:36:07.560" style="s2">just kind of nice window dressing and do</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.910" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">you think that psychedelics can ever be</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.560" end="00:36:14.040" style="s2">offered within a Western medical</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:18.200" style="s2">paradigm well I mean I think I think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.040" end="00:36:22.140" style="s2">medical paradigm was essential for</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.200" end="00:36:23.670" style="s2">socio-political legal reasons and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.140" end="00:36:25.770" style="s2">why there&#39;s been enough that&#39;s why there</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.670" end="00:36:27.840" style="s2">was an initial emphasis on treatment</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.770" end="00:36:28.980" style="s2">resistant depression anxiety those kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.840" end="00:36:30.930" style="s2">of things because that&#39;s actually how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.980" end="00:36:33.180" style="s2">works it works within the legal codes it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.930" end="00:36:35.370" style="s2">works within the system to say okay if</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.180" end="00:36:37.290" style="s2">these people are absolutely out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.370" end="00:36:39.870" style="s2">options then we might allow something</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.290" end="00:36:42.440" style="s2">more radical or innovative etc the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.870" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">that we&#39;re missing is is why would we</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.440" end="00:36:46.500" style="s2">why would we use it what is the ethic of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">use what is the orientation and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.500" end="00:36:53.300" style="s2">to me like at a minimum there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:55.110" style="s2">like three super functional uses for</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.300" end="00:36:57.330" style="s2">Peak States in general I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.110" end="00:36:59.160" style="s2">psychedelics are a use case but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.330" end="00:37:02.220" style="s2">not the only one but it&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.160" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">like first of all as metronym you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.220" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">am out of step with life the pulse the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.550" style="s2">rhythm but I can&#39;t quite I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.140" style="s2">for sure right I&#39;m busy I&#39;m hectic I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.550" end="00:37:15.330" style="s2">distracted I&#39;m all these things and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.140" end="00:37:17.700" style="s2">drop in to a psychedelic State or any</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.330" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">other you know skillfully produced the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.700" end="00:37:22.380" style="s2">ecstatic space and I&#39;m like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">where the one is this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.380" end="00:37:27.180" style="s2">metronome is telling me the beat is and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:29.070" style="s2">I can cook I can correct I might have</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.180" end="00:37:30.630" style="s2">been half half a beat late I might be in</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.070" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">half a beat early whatever it is I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.630" end="00:37:34.700" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:36.950" style="s2">and now I&#39;m on the one and the next one</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.700" end="00:37:38.390" style="s2">is cheating for you know again running</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.950" end="00:37:40.250" style="s2">and going through life we bump into</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.390" end="00:37:42.380" style="s2">things we get hit we get hurt our</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.250" end="00:37:43.880" style="s2">instrument our bodies our brains our</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.380" end="00:37:45.590" style="s2">hots our minds gets knocked out of whack</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.880" end="00:37:47.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re just suddenly we think this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.590" end="00:37:48.950" style="s2">a sieve and it&#39;s actually C sharp or a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.360" end="00:37:50.180" style="s2">little bit flattened really oh okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.950" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">trying to play with others but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.180" end="00:37:55.880" style="s2">actually sharp or flat let me tune my</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:57.980" style="s2">instrument and so the metronome and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.880" end="00:38:00.050" style="s2">tuning fork do a beautiful job of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.980" end="00:38:03.560" style="s2">and if you think you know to continue</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.050" end="00:38:05.660" style="s2">the musical metaphor musicians all use</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.560" end="00:38:07.730" style="s2">metronomes and tuning forks but they</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.660" end="00:38:09.350" style="s2">don&#39;t spend their entire day fiddling</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.730" end="00:38:10.700" style="s2">with knobs and strings and flipping the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.350" end="00:38:12.740" style="s2">pendulum back and forth the moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.700" end="00:38:15.530" style="s2">they&#39;ve got the one and the moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.740" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a clean sea they go off to</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.530" end="00:38:20.060" style="s2">make music they either practice it</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:22.040" style="s2">themselves or they go jam with others</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.060" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the relationship we</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.040" end="00:38:26.660" style="s2">really need with psychedelics not that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:28.340" style="s2">we just constantly you just hit the bell</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.660" end="00:38:29.900" style="s2">hit the bell fiddling on spit all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.340" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">knobs and the ideas like get yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.900" end="00:38:35.240" style="s2">tune get yourself on time go jam that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:37.609" style="s2">the point the point is to go make the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.240" end="00:38:38.630" style="s2">music of life together and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.609" end="00:38:40.460" style="s2">final one it&#39;s a little bit just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.630" end="00:38:43.720" style="s2">training wheels and I think this is one</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.460" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">where the once in a blue moon</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.720" end="00:38:47.630" style="s2">psychedelic experience you know once in</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">a lifetime once a year whatever it would</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.630" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">be needs to be supplemented because what</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:56.060" style="s2">we&#39;re missing I think this sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:38:58.220" style="s2">the weekly Sabbath can we dust that</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:38:59.990" style="s2">bastard off and reinvigorated because</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.220" end="00:39:02.090" style="s2">getting to once a month that once a</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.090" end="00:39:12.050" style="s2">recurringly and periodically because one</p>

<p begin="00:39:12.050" end="00:39:17.660" style="s2">that the research that maps been doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.430" end="00:39:19.130" style="s2">with MDMA therapy right is that it does</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.660" end="00:39:21.950" style="s2">something very specific it shift your</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.130" end="00:39:24.260" style="s2">neuro chemical profile and actually Rick</p>
