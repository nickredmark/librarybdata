<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">became basis of their spiritual ritual</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">healing they were using these states for</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">as a source of inspiration sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">artistic inspiration even for practical</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">purposes you know finding lots objects</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:20.670" style="s2">or lots people or following the movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">of the game of the animals that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.670" end="00:03:28.890" style="s2">were hunting and they had regular events</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">or either groups or the whole tribe</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.890" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">would actually go through and own</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">ordinances of consciousness so their</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:40.829" style="s2">whole philosophy cosmology mythology was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">based on the experiences from these from</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.829" end="00:03:47.940" style="s2">these states now then what happened then</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">in the industrial scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.940" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">is that major discoveries were made that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">were turned into technological</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:03:58.709" style="s2">inventions being with the steam machine</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">and so on and it started radically</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.709" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">changing the world and then came kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:07.950" style="s2">a hubris they came intoxication with</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">what the what the reason can do I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.950" end="00:04:11.639" style="s2">know if you are aware of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">for several years</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.639" end="00:04:18.209" style="s2">not a dime was not a dime in Paris was</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">renamed the temple of Reason so suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.209" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">the reason is he was something that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">modern human humanity was very proud of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">and everything that was not rational was</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:35.340" style="s2">relegated into sort of an area that felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:38.910" style="s2">like embarrassing leftovers from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.340" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">childhood of humanity primitive magical</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.910" end="00:04:44.870" style="s2">thinking and I think what happened here</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">that the the baby was kind of thrown out</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.870" end="00:04:48.389" style="s2">was the bathwater</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">because not everything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.389" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">rational is irrational you see there</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">also states which are translational the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:05:01.470" style="s2">Mystics are not irrational they had</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">experiences that are not normally</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.470" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">available and they had to integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:09.419" style="s2">insights into their worldview they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:11.820" style="s2">no problems with everyday reality you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.419" end="00:05:14.520" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t take a lot of brain to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.820" end="00:05:19.169" style="s2">function in everyday reality but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.520" end="00:05:20.100" style="s2">have something extra like when America</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.169" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">was discovered</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.100" end="00:05:25.220" style="s2">you know Europeans had to expand their</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:27.479" style="s2">worldview they had to integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.220" end="00:05:31.070" style="s2">observations from this new territory</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.479" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">the day before didn&#39;t know about and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.070" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">something similar with the Mystics and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:40.020" style="s2">we are now with transfers in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">new paradigm we are recognizing what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.020" end="00:05:46.130" style="s2">error that was to just dismiss that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">whole area and focus just on reason and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.130" end="00:05:52.260" style="s2">I think we&#39;re paying a big big toll you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">know in terms of how we are destroying</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.260" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">the world we lost really vital viable</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.220" end="00:06:00.660" style="s2">spirituality experience with</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">spirituality hmm speaking from my</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.660" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">personal perspective I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">a lot of inner work a lot of meditations</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve done psychedelics quite a lot when</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:18.440" style="s2">I was at university and on two occasions</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:20.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve had what I experienced as</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.440" end="00:06:22.860" style="s2">incredibly deep spiritual states and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.910" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">when I was in that altered state it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.860" end="00:06:27.720" style="s2">almost felt like I was making contact</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:30.210" style="s2">with other other consciousnesses or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:34.349" style="s2">collective unconscious surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.210" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">synchronicities and but I also found</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.349" end="00:06:39.990" style="s2">that a very difficult experience because</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.020" end="00:06:40.500" style="s2">in that state it became really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.990" end="00:06:42.750" style="s2">to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.500" end="00:06:46.170" style="s2">between meaningful synchronicities and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.750" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">ones that I was creating in my mind does</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.170" end="00:06:53.880" style="s2">that sound familiar as an experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:57.030" style="s2">well in my late wife Christina and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.880" end="00:06:59.580" style="s2">myself we have done quite a bit of work</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.030" end="00:07:00.270" style="s2">with psychedelics and then we developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.580" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">what we call</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:04.980" style="s2">holotropic breathwork were very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:08.070" style="s2">States very similar to psychedelics can</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.980" end="00:07:11.340" style="s2">be induced by something so simple as</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">faster breathing evocative music certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.340" end="00:07:19.590" style="s2">kind of bodywork and a very very clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">implication of that work was that</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.970" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">other other centuries sometimes with a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.329" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">sense of really convincing personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:08.980" style="s2">remembering like the job we deserve a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:11.470" style="s2">key is not the first time this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.980" end="00:09:16.029" style="s2">happening to me I once was that person</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.470" end="00:09:19.149" style="s2">and that can take you into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.029" end="00:09:22.660" style="s2">archetypal world we are meeting details</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.149" end="00:09:25.060" style="s2">from different cultures cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.660" end="00:09:29.260" style="s2">you have never studied this was great</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.060" end="00:09:32.760" style="s2">youngster I said and this could be this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.260" end="00:09:35.800" style="s2">has a dark side and so there are demonic</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.760" end="00:09:38.700" style="s2">archetypes that you can encounter and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.800" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">they are very you know blissful</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.700" end="00:09:43.959" style="s2">incredibly ecstatic kind of states that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:45.459" style="s2">can come everything had a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.959" end="00:09:47.079" style="s2">meaning than what was actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.459" end="00:09:49.570" style="s2">there was a deep symbolic realm that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.079" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">was tapping into and it was very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.570" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">navigate but it felt incredibly like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">most vivid experience I&#39;ve ever had</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:10:00.699" style="s2">does that is that a familiar story yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">so the problem is really with psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.699" end="00:10:08.019" style="s2">the psychiatry has a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">non-functional model so our observations</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.019" end="00:10:13.570" style="s2">show that there&#39;s a significant subgroup</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">of these non-ordinary states of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.570" end="00:10:21.010" style="s2">consciousness that happen spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.300" end="00:10:23.430" style="s2">which are actually healing attempts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.010" end="00:10:26.829" style="s2">the organisms that are crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.430" end="00:10:29.649" style="s2">spiritual opening and they&#39;re mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.829" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">for for pathology because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.649" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">experiences go way beyond the model the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">biographical model which is being being</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:40.870" style="s2">used so when a psychiatrist with</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:43.269" style="s2">traditional training too has to work</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.870" end="00:10:45.699" style="s2">with somebody who is in spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.269" end="00:10:50.199" style="s2">emergency somebody who is reaching into</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.699" end="00:10:54.790" style="s2">these other areas it&#39;s like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.199" end="00:10:56.709" style="s2">blind trying to lead somebody who is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.790" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">sort of seeing its problems you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.709" end="00:11:00.550" style="s2">with seeing through one eye or something</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:02.199" style="s2">like that does it sound like a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.550" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">emergency the one that I just described</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.199" end="00:11:06.120" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:09.389" style="s2">well we wrote we wrote</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.189" end="00:11:19.610" style="s2">other one was a compendium we collected</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.620" end="00:11:21.809" style="s2">papers of other people who sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.610" end="00:11:23.389" style="s2">presented different aspects of the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.809" end="00:11:26.129" style="s2">kind of idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.389" end="00:11:29.009" style="s2">beginning with the classical paper of</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:31.679" style="s2">emergency and then Cristina 1980 started</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.069" end="00:13:01.800" style="s2">psychiatry simply cannot explain the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.889" end="00:13:04.019" style="s2">model is it&#39;s really too narrow too</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.800" end="00:13:07.559" style="s2">superficial but you believe these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.019" end="00:13:10.519" style="s2">are real that they are really existing a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.559" end="00:13:12.420" style="s2">lot of these experiences are are</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.519" end="00:13:15.470" style="s2">subjectively real what do you think they</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.470" end="00:13:22.220" style="s2">lot of my effort was to actually show</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:25.520" style="s2">that many of them are what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.220" end="00:13:27.800" style="s2">ontologically real and it starts with</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.779" end="00:13:35.540" style="s2">remember anything from birth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:39.170" style="s2">actually a strange strange belief that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.540" end="00:13:42.260" style="s2">there is no consciousness in births or</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.170" end="00:13:45.080" style="s2">even in newborns as I don&#39;t know several</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.260" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">months ago I think there was a article</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.080" end="00:13:51.200" style="s2">British scientists show that newborns</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:53.450" style="s2">can experience pain the next thing we&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.450" end="00:14:02.770" style="s2">experience pain so the belief that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.860" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">there&#39;s no no consciousness no memory of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.770" end="00:14:09.890" style="s2">anything that that precedes at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:12.980" style="s2">moment of birth and the reason that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.890" end="00:14:16.310" style="s2">given for this is that they the cortex</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.980" end="00:14:20.149" style="s2">of the newborn is not fully myelin asti</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.310" end="00:14:24.040" style="s2">the protective fetish sheets myelin</p>

<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">not they are not sort of legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">aspects of the human psyche they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:20.400" style="s2">sort of some kind of alien Enclave which</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.430" style="s2">is bizarre belief system I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.400" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">anybody experienced what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.430" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">when you when you have archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:30.300" style="s2">experiences that would have been some</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:32.580" style="s2">pathological process as a beauty there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.300" end="00:16:35.520" style="s2">an artistry in that that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.580" end="00:16:37.490" style="s2">pathological process cannot create if</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.520" end="00:16:40.860" style="s2">your pathological process in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.490" end="00:16:44.330" style="s2">it&#39;s going to disturb your intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.860" end="00:16:48.300" style="s2">faculties it&#39;s going to it might cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.330" end="00:16:51.060" style="s2">this you know disorientation in time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.300" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">space it will give you amnesia you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.060" end="00:16:56.310" style="s2">not remember some things but will not</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:59.250" style="s2">sort of make you experience Shiva</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.310" end="00:17:01.740" style="s2">Nataraja or take you to the Cimmerian</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.250" end="00:17:04.230" style="s2">underworld you know so this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.740" end="00:17:08.610" style="s2">very unconvincing thinking in psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.230" end="00:17:12.510" style="s2">in it that we somehow board and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.610" end="00:17:16.320" style="s2">perpetuate it&#39;s not tenable anymore so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.510" end="00:17:19.020" style="s2">you think it&#39;s a misdiagnosis that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.320" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">of these people are misdiagnosed yes we</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.020" end="00:17:24.090" style="s2">don&#39;t have a category mystical</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:26.090" style="s2">experience spiritual experience so every</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.090" end="00:17:29.550" style="s2">experience of this kind would be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.090" end="00:17:33.180" style="s2">pathology of one kind of another and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.550" end="00:17:35.390" style="s2">approach is you know put people on</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.180" end="00:17:39.690" style="s2">tranquilizers or some other medication</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">if it&#39;s intense hospitalized then put</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.690" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">put diagnosis on them</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.639" end="00:17:46.099" style="s2">diagnosis which doesn&#39;t really mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.539" end="00:17:50.129" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.099" end="00:17:51.690" style="s2">this psychosis that where we can find</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.129" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">something organic these are organic</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.690" end="00:17:57.119" style="s2">psychos those are medical problems and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:59.940" style="s2">we can find something in on the x-rays</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.119" end="00:18:01.739" style="s2">or in the cerebral spinal fluid or in</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.940" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">the blood and so on we can really make a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.739" end="00:18:07.499" style="s2">medical diagnosis but there&#39;s a large</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:12.259" style="s2">category of these so called psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.499" end="00:18:16.759" style="s2">which we call endogenous or functional</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.259" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">now if you know something about medicine</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.759" end="00:18:24.899" style="s2">you know what this means if somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:26.999" style="s2">epileptic seizures after a trauma we</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.899" end="00:18:29.789" style="s2">call it post-traumatic epilepsy</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.999" end="00:18:31.830" style="s2">if somebody starts having seizures and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.789" end="00:18:34.109" style="s2">we don&#39;t find the reason we don&#39;t say we</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.830" end="00:18:38.609" style="s2">don&#39;t have a clue we give it a name</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.109" end="00:18:40.950" style="s2">idiopathic epilepsy or you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.609" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">functional or whatever if you say</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.950" end="00:18:48.330" style="s2">endogenous psychosis it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:51.869" style="s2">mean anything it means that the person</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.330" end="00:18:54.989" style="s2">has experiences and behaviors that your</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.869" end="00:18:57.979" style="s2">model doesn&#39;t explain and that term</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.989" end="00:19:00.359" style="s2">literally means generated from within</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.979" end="00:19:04.019" style="s2">but we sort of present it&#39;s endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.359" end="00:19:08.879" style="s2">psychosis as if it was anything behind</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.019" end="00:19:12.419" style="s2">it it&#39;s a tautology yeah so this is just</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.879" end="00:19:14.669" style="s2">a large category of states that just</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.419" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">because the current model doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.669" end="00:19:21.169" style="s2">include those experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:27.149" style="s2">coming up then it&#39;s seen as product of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.169" end="00:19:29.129" style="s2">pathology but there&#39;s really no medical</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.149" end="00:19:31.649" style="s2">documentation we don&#39;t find anything in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.129" end="00:19:35.580" style="s2">the cerebrospinal fluid you don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.649" end="00:19:38.609" style="s2">anything in in blood there&#39;s nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.580" end="00:19:42.749" style="s2">to support the idea that this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.609" end="00:19:44.809" style="s2">diagnosis if you have diagnosis in</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.749" end="00:19:49.739" style="s2">somatic medicine it means something you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.809" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">know you have to have something related</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.739" end="00:19:54.299" style="s2">to etiology why why this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">it has reflection for what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.299" end="00:19:59.220" style="s2">pathogenesis how</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:03.420" style="s2">that cause symptoms developed it has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:06.900" style="s2">have some kind of prognostic value and</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.420" end="00:20:10.110" style="s2">also guide you for some specific form of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.900" end="00:20:12.060" style="s2">therapy if you have anemia you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.110" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">make a diagnosis what kind of anemia</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.060" end="00:20:14.760" style="s2">will it respond to iron ore it respond</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:19.140" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.760" end="00:20:22.380" style="s2">vitamin b12 transfusions or whatever if</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.140" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">you have infection you have to diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.380" end="00:20:26.160" style="s2">what kind of infection because different</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:30.000" style="s2">infections have to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.160" end="00:20:33.650" style="s2">differently if you say endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.000" end="00:20:37.410" style="s2">psychosis you know there anything from</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.650" end="00:20:39.900" style="s2">use like of in the past insulin comas</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.410" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">electroshocks to people trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.900" end="00:20:44.700" style="s2">psychotherapy so it doesn&#39;t with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:48.660" style="s2">psychosis it doesn&#39;t really commit you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.700" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">to do any specific treatment when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.660" end="00:20:54.870" style="s2">have that experience that the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">general framework is that the Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.870" end="00:21:00.210" style="s2">industrial civilization consider these</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:02.070" style="s2">things to be crazy so you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.210" end="00:21:03.960" style="s2">kind of any conceptual framework that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.070" end="00:21:06.390" style="s2">would suggest that maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.960" end="00:21:09.270" style="s2">something different you you know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.390" end="00:21:11.490" style="s2">the medical profession the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.270" end="00:21:17.370" style="s2">they know you know this is we have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.490" end="00:21:20.430" style="s2">the inflation of sort of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.370" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">appreciation of anybody who was involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.430" end="00:21:26.940" style="s2">in in science like science got people to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">the moon and developed lasers and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.940" end="00:21:30.660" style="s2">computers and if you come there the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:35.310" style="s2">psychiatrist they think you have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.660" end="00:21:38.370" style="s2">same kind of you know accurate sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.310" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">solid understanding so you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.370" end="00:21:42.540" style="s2">paradigm that gets you to the moon and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:46.860" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s very lousy when</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.540" end="00:21:49.080" style="s2">it&#39;s applied to to psychiatry but there</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.860" end="00:21:51.330" style="s2">is a there&#39;s a magic about you you sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.080" end="00:21:53.580" style="s2">there as a representative of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.330" end="00:21:58.100" style="s2">profession that is supposed to know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.580" end="00:22:01.470" style="s2">they have a certain position about</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.100" end="00:22:04.650" style="s2">psychotics of the psychotic state so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.470" end="00:22:07.080" style="s2">know experts label you as crazy so who</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.650" end="00:22:09.670" style="s2">are you to challenge it even if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.080" end="00:22:13.180" style="s2">yourself seem there&#39;s some value in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.670" end="00:22:17.850" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.180" end="00:22:21.610" style="s2">the other thing yes you even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.850" end="00:22:23.800" style="s2">germane content of the of the psyche it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.610" end="00:22:26.950" style="s2">can get scary I mean there are the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.800" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">archetypal beings which are very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.950" end="00:22:33.490" style="s2">scary dark sort of mythological beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:34.030" style="s2">or it takes you into the underworld and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.030" end="00:22:37.240" style="s2">and you believe you can actually make</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.830" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">contact with those in altered states</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.240" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">yeah plus plus you know they&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:47.590" style="s2">sources of real fear I mean if you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">reliving something that was the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.590" end="00:22:52.360" style="s2">40 hours when you died in the birth</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:55.450" style="s2">canal and you had to be resuscitated</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.360" end="00:22:57.910" style="s2">there is a pocket of enormous anxiety so</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.450" end="00:23:01.210" style="s2">when it starts surfacing you know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.910" end="00:23:04.780" style="s2">will you will get very scared now</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.210" end="00:23:07.330" style="s2">another thing you can be you can connect</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.780" end="00:23:11.350" style="s2">to the prenatal state and there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.330" end="00:23:14.020" style="s2">heavy toxicity your mother or there even</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.350" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">cases where the repeated attempts at</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.020" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">abortion you know some some toxic</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">substances being introduced into into</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:27.310" style="s2">the mother&#39;s body so if you hit if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:29.140" style="s2">hit that kind of memory you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.310" end="00:23:32.380" style="s2">probably paranoid like you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.140" end="00:23:35.490" style="s2">believe a lot of the so-called psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.380" end="00:23:38.050" style="s2">patients to deal with poisons they say</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.490" end="00:23:40.030" style="s2">their neighbor sort of is digging</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.050" end="00:23:43.600" style="s2">tunnels getting into their house</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.030" end="00:23:46.810" style="s2">somebody poisoned the food in there so</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.600" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">they feel intoxicated they feel they</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.810" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2">feel poisoned and so on and then you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">know who is doing this they have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:57.960" style="s2">conceptual framework what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:24:01.090" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a tendency to project it</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.960" end="00:24:02.800" style="s2">that is you know what is the dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.090" end="00:24:05.490" style="s2">situation that it&#39;s coming from and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.800" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">on so there are good reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.490" end="00:24:11.410" style="s2">paranoia if you want the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:13.180" style="s2">that can happen frequently that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.410" end="00:24:16.530" style="s2">start experiences what you called</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.180" end="00:24:20.010" style="s2">synchronicity the unbelievable sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.530" end="00:24:22.180" style="s2">coincidences and they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.010" end="00:24:26.170" style="s2">focusing on you</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.180" end="00:24:27.760" style="s2">and this is known in psychiatry but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.170" end="00:24:30.430" style="s2">dismissed it&#39;s called delusion of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.760" end="00:24:34.120" style="s2">reference we don&#39;t we know there are no</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.430" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">meaningful coincidences related to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.120" end="00:24:40.410" style="s2">so you are making it up but anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:43.180" style="s2">studies these synchronicities who as the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.410" end="00:24:45.660" style="s2">objective evidence has to say this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.180" end="00:24:48.430" style="s2">way beyond statistical probability I</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.660" end="00:24:51.160" style="s2">have I wrote a book when the impossible</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.430" end="00:24:53.140" style="s2">happens which is kind of biographical</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.160" end="00:24:55.420" style="s2">where I describe things that happen to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.140" end="00:24:57.400" style="s2">me that I&#39;ve seen that current science</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.420" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">would consider absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.400" end="00:25:02.410" style="s2">impossible would could not happen in our</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:04.980" style="s2">universe and these unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.410" end="00:25:07.990" style="s2">synchronicities are very much like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.980" end="00:25:10.090" style="s2">for somebody they can seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.990" end="00:25:12.700" style="s2">positive things are lining up that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.090" end="00:25:15.210" style="s2">universe is sort of you know caring</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.700" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">about them and it&#39;s guiding them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.210" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">sometimes it seems that the the coin set</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:23.260" style="s2">is a kind of closing closing in and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:26.170" style="s2">feel sort of surrounded and suddenly it</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.260" end="00:25:29.470" style="s2">starts making sense that you in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.170" end="00:25:32.140" style="s2">sense persecuted and so on this this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.470" end="00:25:33.280" style="s2">very similar my experience in those</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.140" end="00:25:36.090" style="s2">altered states is that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.280" end="00:25:38.830" style="s2">synchronicities come thick and fast and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.090" end="00:25:41.050" style="s2">in a way stop being remarkable you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.830" end="00:25:42.730" style="s2">get used to the fact that the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.050" end="00:25:43.900" style="s2">person comes along at the right time or</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.730" end="00:25:46.780" style="s2">the right things happens at the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.900" end="00:25:50.590" style="s2">time but that in my experience can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.780" end="00:25:53.380" style="s2">very can be quite overwhelming and can</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.590" end="00:25:55.090" style="s2">be quite destabilizing because you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.380" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2">start seeing meaning maybe when there</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.090" end="00:26:00.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t like you get so used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:01.900" style="s2">coincidences that you take everything as</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.130" end="00:26:04.060" style="s2">a synchronicity when maybe it isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.900" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">quite easy to lose my experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.060" end="00:26:06.730" style="s2">very hot easy to lose one&#39;s bearings in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:09.070" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.730" end="00:26:14.170" style="s2">well this is something this was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.070" end="00:26:16.620" style="s2">discovery of Jung who became aware of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.170" end="00:26:21.300" style="s2">the fact that they are very very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.620" end="00:26:23.950" style="s2">coincidences that can happen in life and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.300" end="00:26:26.200" style="s2">some of them seem to be just coincident</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.950" end="00:26:27.880" style="s2">it&#39;s in the external world but then he</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.200" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">noticed there&#39;s different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.880" end="00:26:33.220" style="s2">coincidence where the connection is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:35.740" style="s2">between an intra psychic phenomenon like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.220" end="00:26:38.050" style="s2">a dream or a vision and something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.740" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">happened in what we call objective</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.050" end="00:26:43.930" style="s2">reality that if the psyche gets into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:45.670" style="s2">plane full interaction with the physical</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.930" end="00:26:47.740" style="s2">world that should not be happening in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.670" end="00:26:50.560" style="s2">the Cartesian Newtonian well there</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.740" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">should be the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.560" end="00:26:55.740" style="s2">and it is the psyche they should not</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:58.330" style="s2">sort of you know get into playful</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.740" end="00:27:01.660" style="s2">interaction and but it is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.330" end="00:27:05.020" style="s2">is happening and so he was observing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.660" end="00:27:06.630" style="s2">actually for 20 years before he dared to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.020" end="00:27:10.030" style="s2">present it to the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.630" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">because it violates that the basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.030" end="00:27:14.710" style="s2">principle in science which is linear</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:18.310" style="s2">causality everything should have a cause</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.710" end="00:27:20.230" style="s2">and and an effect and suddenly you find</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.310" end="00:27:23.920" style="s2">something that you cannot explain in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.230" end="00:27:27.630" style="s2">terms of linear causality in in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.920" end="00:27:30.120" style="s2">horizontal sense and that in itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.630" end="00:27:33.330" style="s2">points to there being more going on that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.120" end="00:27:37.080" style="s2">the consciousness itself has some</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.330" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">interaction or creative power in itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.080" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">well you see what happened is that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:45.040" style="s2">startled he was being you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">surrounded by the kind of professional</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.040" end="00:27:49.450" style="s2">community obviously it was part of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:52.120" style="s2">him questioning his own sanity where</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.450" end="00:27:55.480" style="s2">these things were happening so yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.120" end="00:27:57.640" style="s2">was aware of what a bomb it is for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.480" end="00:28:02.290" style="s2">scientific community took 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.640" end="00:28:04.810" style="s2">collecting this is before he went out</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.290" end="00:28:08.230" style="s2">with it and actually he got tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.810" end="00:28:10.390" style="s2">support from Albert Einstein who visited</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.230" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">had they had lunch and he told Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.390" end="00:28:16.360" style="s2">and I started carry on studied it</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:21.070" style="s2">because it is now emerging in modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.360" end="00:28:23.620" style="s2">physics I also got reinforcements from</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.070" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">Vogue and Paul II who was somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:29.110" style="s2">was very much involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:31.450" style="s2">development of quantum physics and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.110" end="00:28:34.060" style="s2">was initially Young&#39;s patient and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.450" end="00:28:36.340" style="s2">they became became friends and he also</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.060" end="00:28:39.850" style="s2">encouraged him said this is now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.340" end="00:28:42.700" style="s2">coming out from physics and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.850" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">now experiments you know with welds</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.700" end="00:28:48.160" style="s2">theorem and the showing that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:50.770" style="s2">universe is basically non-local that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:54.160" style="s2">that this distance is you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.770" end="00:28:57.370" style="s2">have that kind of absolute value that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.160" end="00:28:59.650" style="s2">attributed and I can synchronistic</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.370" end="00:29:01.900" style="s2">things can happen where things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.650" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">connected over enormous distances and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.900" end="00:29:08.260" style="s2">on so this is now accepted in in modern</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:11.230" style="s2">physics so that whole concept of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.260" end="00:29:14.170" style="s2">delusion of reference and so on has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.230" end="00:29:16.450" style="s2">transcended I have in the book when the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.170" end="00:29:19.180" style="s2">impossible happens maybe one third of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.450" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">is about amazing synchronicities that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.180" end="00:29:29.500" style="s2">that happened and so you see if we had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:31.210" style="s2">psychiatry who describes this and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.500" end="00:29:33.370" style="s2">would become part of general knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.210" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">and so on you would be in a better</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.370" end="00:29:38.050" style="s2">position when the synchronicities start</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:41.260" style="s2">happening you would know that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.050" end="00:29:43.090" style="s2">phenomenon the synchronicities increase</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.260" end="00:29:45.310" style="s2">when you are in a non-ordinary states of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.090" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">consciousness incident increases and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.310" end="00:29:51.730" style="s2">on you could still get scared but you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.280" end="00:29:54.040" style="s2">would have something to you know to work</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.730" end="00:29:58.090" style="s2">with the other thing we would know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.040" end="00:29:59.950" style="s2">if somebody is in a state of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.090" end="00:30:02.260" style="s2">of activation of the unconscious the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.950" end="00:30:04.960" style="s2">person needs special place not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.260" end="00:30:07.900" style="s2">psychiatric hospital a tranquilizer but</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">be in a safe environment to people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.900" end="00:30:12.070" style="s2">know something about this ideally</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">experienced it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.070" end="00:30:18.220" style="s2">and they can give them reassurance and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.650" end="00:30:20.520" style="s2">say this is fine you know a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.220" end="00:30:22.450" style="s2">important part for example this latest</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.520" end="00:30:24.520" style="s2">experience of death River</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.450" end="00:30:27.280" style="s2">psycho-spiritual death rebirth when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.520" end="00:30:28.990" style="s2">might feel you&#39;re dying so you need</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">somebody hold to hold your hand such</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.990" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">this is not real dying just go this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:37.590" style="s2">this is part of a reverse process you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">imagine like the 60s where it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.590" end="00:30:43.000" style="s2">neither ourselves nor the young people</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.780" end="00:30:45.430" style="s2">who were experimenting at no Norwich</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.000" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna take them you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.430" end="00:30:50.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a scary stuff here it was bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">enough to discover new territories and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.910" end="00:30:55.630" style="s2">you know and people were moving to new</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:30:58.270" style="s2">countries and they didn&#39;t know what they</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.630" end="00:30:59.800" style="s2">were finding this is much scarier you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.270" end="00:31:02.110" style="s2">need maps you need some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.800" end="00:31:07.150" style="s2">understanding and you still make</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.110" end="00:31:10.510" style="s2">it&#39;s good but it helps and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.150" end="00:31:13.240" style="s2">experience that that that I had for</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.510" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">example do you think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.240" end="00:31:18.700" style="s2">important to integrate or to understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:20.710" style="s2">those I think it&#39;s enough if you if you</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:26.590" style="s2">is very important in life yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:31.590" style="s2">somebody who spelled it you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.590" end="00:32:34.929" style="s2">obviously I tried but before me a young</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">the idea was that we should live our</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:42.910" style="s2">behaviors which are and approaches and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.290" end="00:32:45.640" style="s2">strategies which are based on what we</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.910" end="00:32:48.460" style="s2">see in the external world but spend some</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.640" end="00:32:51.730" style="s2">significant time doing self self</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.460" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">exploration examination and we would be</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.530" end="00:33:08.049" style="s2">the self is the big self different from</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.750" end="00:33:10.900" style="s2">the ego and so you connect with it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.049" end="00:33:14.950" style="s2">you find guidance from the inner</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.900" end="00:33:17.230" style="s2">intelligence and we are using this as</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.950" end="00:33:19.960" style="s2">basic principle in the work with</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.230" end="00:33:24.639" style="s2">holotropic states what I call holotropic</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.960" end="00:33:26.620" style="s2">states are States it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.639" end="00:33:27.929" style="s2">subgroup of non-ordinary states that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.620" end="00:33:30.610" style="s2">have this healing potential</p>

<p begin="00:33:30.610" end="00:33:37.630" style="s2">potential so when we work with these</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.010" end="00:33:40.179" style="s2">states the essential principle there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.630" end="00:33:43.419" style="s2">you mobilize inner healing self healing</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.179" end="00:33:45.820" style="s2">intelligence and this is what Jung was</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.419" end="00:33:48.669" style="s2">talking very much you know you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.820" end="00:33:51.220" style="s2">the analyst that goes and figures it all</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.669" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">out and that&#39;s brilliant interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.220" end="00:33:55.480" style="s2">and so on that wouldn&#39;t work because we</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:56.950" style="s2">have any number of schools and each</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.480" end="00:34:00.549" style="s2">school will tell you something different</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.950" end="00:34:03.760" style="s2">about the same thing so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.549" end="00:34:07.269" style="s2">unanimity among schools of psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.760" end="00:34:09.849" style="s2">as to what are the most important</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.269" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">motivating forces in the psyche why</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.849" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">symptoms develop what they mean how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:18.339" style="s2">interpret them and each of those schools</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">developed a different technique so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.339" end="00:34:21.700" style="s2">you have a problem in the current</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:24.040" style="s2">circumstances you can flip a coin you</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.700" end="00:34:26.589" style="s2">choose a school and with each school</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.040" end="00:34:29.649" style="s2">comes a different story but what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.589" end="00:34:31.480" style="s2">with you what you should do so this</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.649" end="00:34:34.149" style="s2">basic principle with the whole topic</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.480" end="00:34:36.270" style="s2">status if the experts cannot reach</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.149" end="00:34:40.089" style="s2">agreement why don&#39;t you trust your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.270" end="00:34:42.429" style="s2">healing intelligence your body can do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.089" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">why not the psyche your body can heal</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.429" end="00:34:48.010" style="s2">itself what comes through very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">when almost every time I do a breath</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.010" end="00:34:53.379" style="s2">session is I I just know I can see where</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:56.139" style="s2">I&#39;m going wrong in the world and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.379" end="00:34:58.390" style="s2">like I feel like I&#39;m tapping into my the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.139" end="00:35:00.910" style="s2">part of me that already knows what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.390" end="00:35:04.690" style="s2">supposed to do what my mission is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.910" end="00:35:07.089" style="s2">my what I need to do next and it just it</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.690" end="00:35:09.089" style="s2">feels like a download from a from</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.089" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.089" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">yeah now what we see if you get into</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:20.319" style="s2">this holotropic state which would be you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:23.650" style="s2">know the psychedelic states working with</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.319" end="00:35:26.109" style="s2">breath but also in anthropology would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.650" end="00:35:27.790" style="s2">shamanic work the kind of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.109" end="00:35:28.840" style="s2">that the shamans have as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.790" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">initiatory cry</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.840" end="00:35:34.900" style="s2">and that they use with their clients the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:37.900" style="s2">kind of experiences that the initiates</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">have in rites of passage in Aboriginal</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.900" end="00:35:42.910" style="s2">culture the kind of experiences that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:46.060" style="s2">initiates had in the ancient mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.910" end="00:35:49.540" style="s2">of death and rebirth in Egypt analysis</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.060" end="00:35:52.090" style="s2">in Sumer in in Mesoamerica and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.540" end="00:35:54.850" style="s2">then also what I call technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.090" end="00:35:57.070" style="s2">the sacred which were methods of</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.850" end="00:35:59.800" style="s2">inducing these states developed in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.070" end="00:36:01.750" style="s2">context of the great religions so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.800" end="00:36:05.080" style="s2">say Christian mystics that things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.750" end="00:36:08.020" style="s2">essa cousin Jesus Prayer or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.080" end="00:36:12.310" style="s2">Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola they</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.020" end="00:36:13.180" style="s2">were using in monasteries fasting sleep</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.310" end="00:36:16.360" style="s2">deprivation</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.180" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">you know extended prayers and so on in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.360" end="00:36:24.150" style="s2">Sufism you have you have the whirling or</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:28.270" style="s2">you have various sort of chance the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.150" end="00:36:30.670" style="s2">seeker because he caressed and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.270" end="00:36:33.670" style="s2">have you know Kabbalah and you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.670" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">Taoist ik you have different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.670" end="00:36:38.680" style="s2">yoga different schools of Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">so on those are all designed to induce</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.680" end="00:36:43.660" style="s2">these states that I call holotropic</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:46.120" style="s2">there they lead to spiritual opening</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.660" end="00:36:53.010" style="s2">they lead to healing transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.120" end="00:36:55.900" style="s2">so on so the work with holotropic States</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.010" end="00:36:59.740" style="s2">has very important implications it</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.900" end="00:37:02.890" style="s2">functions the state function as a radar</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.740" end="00:37:05.740" style="s2">which will find in your psyche and in</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.890" end="00:37:08.310" style="s2">your body where there are problems which</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.740" end="00:37:10.630" style="s2">would mean finds in your unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.310" end="00:37:13.630" style="s2">material which has strong emotional</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.630" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">charge and which also is in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:18.190" style="s2">position to the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:21.220" style="s2">consciousness is close so it&#39;s ready to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.190" end="00:37:22.870" style="s2">emerge today for processing there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.220" end="00:37:25.150" style="s2">other things which are very important</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.870" end="00:37:28.150" style="s2">but they still bear it very deep they</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.150" end="00:37:31.030" style="s2">will it will take two sessions or three</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.150" end="00:37:33.400" style="s2">sessions before they make it to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.030" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">position towards the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.400" end="00:37:39.340" style="s2">consciousness that I are ready to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">but you basically see this process as</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.340" end="00:37:44.980" style="s2">self-healing</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:47.090" style="s2">yeah and it is the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.980" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">psychiatry is becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.090" end="00:37:54.440" style="s2">which is symptomatic control and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.099" style="s2">it&#39;s confused with therapies called</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.440" end="00:37:58.119" style="s2">therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.099" end="00:38:02.590" style="s2">it&#39;s basically suppression of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.119" end="00:38:02.590" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not therapy</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.680" end="00:38:08.180" style="s2">psychiatry historically developed a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.420" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">subspecialty of medicine so we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.180" end="00:38:14.780" style="s2">use medical thinking interest finding</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:17.060" style="s2">the right diagnosis which is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.780" end="00:38:19.700" style="s2">difficult with those conditions which</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.060" end="00:38:22.760" style="s2">are not biological in America we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:26.599" style="s2">now diagnostic Statistical Manual number</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.760" end="00:38:28.910" style="s2">five tremendous fights about what should</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.599" end="00:38:33.490" style="s2">go how what it should be written like</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.910" end="00:38:35.750" style="s2">and the clinicians basically constantly</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.490" end="00:38:38.210" style="s2">complain that they cannot match what</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.750" end="00:38:40.130" style="s2">they see in their patients so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.210" end="00:38:43.660" style="s2">concept of diagnosis simply does not</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.130" end="00:38:50.750" style="s2">apply to psychiatry unless these data</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.660" end="00:38:53.270" style="s2">are organic so we need really a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.750" end="00:38:57.320" style="s2">different you know very different</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.270" end="00:39:01.630" style="s2">approach to this this symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.320" end="00:39:03.950" style="s2">treatment or limiting your approach to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.630" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">suppression of symptoms would be very</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.950" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">bad medicine if you be you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.320" end="00:39:15.800" style="s2">ask why it is there and go to the causes</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">to some ideological intervention it</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.660" end="00:39:35.930" style="s2">some kind of infection that would kill</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:40:00.860" style="s2">work with the symptoms so to do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.760" end="00:40:03.170" style="s2">else but suppress symptoms in psychiatry</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.860" end="00:40:06.110" style="s2">is like treating these conditions as if</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.110" end="00:40:12.320" style="s2">nothing else we can do but suppress the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.630" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">symptoms and it is very much supported</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.320" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">economically of course by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2">pharmaceutical companies it says there</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:20.830" style="s2">is a deep connection between the</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.660" end="00:40:32.270" style="s2">developing something like psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.850" end="00:40:34.040" style="s2">something that you do once in a while do</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.270" end="00:40:36.670" style="s2">you want something like Librium valium</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:53.360" style="s2">and how important as a culture do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.490" end="00:40:54.650" style="s2">think it is for us to re-establish some</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.360" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">kind of access or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.650" end="00:41:00.920" style="s2">relationship with these kind of altered</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:03.050" style="s2">states well I think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.920" end="00:41:06.230" style="s2">and you know all the ancient cultures</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.050" end="00:41:08.900" style="s2">all the pre-industrial native cultures</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.230" end="00:41:11.090" style="s2">they saw that this value in these</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.900" end="00:41:13.820" style="s2">northern estates and they spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.090" end="00:41:18.320" style="s2">time and energy developing safe and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.820" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">powerful ways of healing now we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.320" end="00:41:24.020" style="s2">poo-poo that we dismiss that when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:27.260" style="s2">know then we became rational we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.020" end="00:41:32.990" style="s2">scientists and so we have psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.260" end="00:41:35.090" style="s2">or or behaviorism and so on when I had</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.990" end="00:41:36.980" style="s2">some psychedelic experiences and started</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.090" end="00:41:39.740" style="s2">working with patients and saw the power</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.980" end="00:41:42.590" style="s2">of it I apologized to the shamans what</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.740" end="00:41:46.850" style="s2">we think about this is these sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.590" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">know savages just barely lit literally</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.850" end="00:41:52.190" style="s2">and they do some kind of mumbo-jumbo</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:56.210" style="s2">there I realize of the power of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.190" end="00:41:58.010" style="s2">medicines I would compare it to I was in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.210" end="00:42:00.140" style="s2">psychoanalysis for seven years if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.010" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">would compare what what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.140" end="00:42:04.580" style="s2">those days with what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:07.550" style="s2">psychoanalysis or the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.580" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">deconditioning it becomes like a joke I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.550" end="00:42:11.550" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:15.870" style="s2">really powerful intervention in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.550" end="00:42:17.640" style="s2">psyche and if it&#39;s done properly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.870" end="00:42:19.890" style="s2">if you have a powerful tool you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.640" end="00:42:23.010" style="s2">be careful how you&#39;re using it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.890" end="00:42:24.420" style="s2">something to play with you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.010" end="00:42:26.190" style="s2">amazing that there were not more</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.420" end="00:42:28.590" style="s2">casualties in places like Woodstock</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.190" end="00:42:30.750" style="s2">where half a million people they brought</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.590" end="00:42:32.340" style="s2">loads of it and we&#39;re ending it with</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.340" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">were taking it&#39;s amazing that there were</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.220" end="00:42:39.630" style="s2">not more casualties I mean people been</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.220" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">drinking there there would be more</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.630" end="00:42:45.390" style="s2">casualties and all this when I see</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:47.940" style="s2">people like people doing raves they</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.390" end="00:42:49.980" style="s2">would take something in the open square</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.940" end="00:42:52.710" style="s2">they they know they don&#39;t know what they</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.710" end="00:42:57.330" style="s2">something illegal the police can come</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.830" end="00:42:59.150" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not a great set and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.330" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">setting you don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.150" end="00:43:04.230" style="s2">healing sort of miracles happen under</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:06.990" style="s2">dr. Gupta&#39;s but I mean there is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.230" end="00:43:08.700" style="s2">using it responsibly where it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.990" end="00:43:12.570" style="s2">more powerful than anything we have</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.700" end="00:43:14.670" style="s2">available in psychiatry and I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.570" end="00:43:17.820" style="s2">we are returning to that real</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.670" end="00:43:20.070" style="s2">renaissance now after 40 years where it</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.820" end="00:43:23.750" style="s2">was practically impossible - this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.070" end="00:43:23.750" style="s2">fantastic segue into the last question</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.810" end="00:43:28.890" style="s2">because I guess all of us who I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.330" end="00:43:31.740" style="s2">studied a lot I&#39;ve read all of your</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.599" end="00:46:59.079" style="s2">difficult to say I believe that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.190" end="00:47:01.779" style="s2">probably the only hope it&#39;s a humanity</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.660" end="00:47:47.289" style="s2">like from the Stone Age only where they</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.960" end="00:47:50.589" style="s2">were using clubs stuff at stones they</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.289" end="00:47:53.819" style="s2">did do much damage and even after the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.589" end="00:47:56.289" style="s2">big battles you know 50 years later</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.819" end="00:47:58.329" style="s2">nature would recycle everything and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.289" end="00:48:01.450" style="s2">could barely know that something was</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.329" end="00:48:04.660" style="s2">there now this one accident in Chernobyl</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.450" end="00:48:06.670" style="s2">you know this the radioactivity will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.660" end="00:48:07.059" style="s2">around for hundreds and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.670" end="00:48:10.289" style="s2">years</p>

<p begin="00:48:16.809" end="00:48:21.369" style="s2">who live hopeful yeah people who have</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.410" style="s2">past life experiences and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.369" end="00:48:26.200" style="s2">experiences you know they are okay in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.410" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">this be the maniacs are those who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.200" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">spinning these kinds of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:36.759" style="s2">scenarios you know nuclear confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:40.779" style="s2">and stuff like that so you&#39;re asking am</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.759" end="00:48:44.769" style="s2">i hopeful and moderately hopeful if it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.779" end="00:48:47.979" style="s2">were just based on what we see I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.769" end="00:48:49.609" style="s2">probably be pretty you know pretty</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.979" end="00:48:51.499" style="s2">pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.609" end="00:48:54.829" style="s2">but there seems to be things happening</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.499" end="00:48:57.430" style="s2">on some our other level like for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.829" end="00:49:00.230" style="s2">a lot of people are going through</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.430" end="00:49:02.839" style="s2">powerful transformation without it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.230" end="00:49:05.390" style="s2">showing like what was showing in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.839" end="00:49:07.999" style="s2">people painting their cars psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.390" end="00:49:12.890" style="s2">colors and you know wearing long hair</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.999" end="00:49:17.480" style="s2">and beards so that very very easily</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.890" end="00:49:19.309" style="s2">identified identifiable as troublemakers</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.480" end="00:49:22.279" style="s2">you know they were the ones who were</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.309" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">around the Capitol protesting against</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.279" end="00:49:28.190" style="s2">the Vietnam War and so on today the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:30.619" style="s2">transformation a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.190" end="00:49:33.890" style="s2">involved in transformation but it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.619" end="00:49:37.430" style="s2">was much more skillful means as the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.890" end="00:49:40.609" style="s2">Buddhists call it you know and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.430" end="00:49:42.710" style="s2">it&#39;s our ultimately our only hope that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.609" end="00:49:47.089" style="s2">the people change and and true</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.710" end="00:49:50.210" style="s2">spirituality comes into the planet we</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.089" end="00:49:52.999" style="s2">have lost genuine experiential</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.210" end="00:49:56.329" style="s2">spirituality we have religions but there</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.999" end="00:49:59.420" style="s2">are more of a problem than solution you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.329" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">know you have organized religions that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.420" end="00:50:04.999" style="s2">that unite a certain group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:07.700" style="s2">are want to see think the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.999" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">worship the same way but it also divides</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.700" end="00:50:13.640" style="s2">the world it&#39;s it&#39;s setting that group</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:15.769" style="s2">against another we are Christians and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.640" end="00:50:18.259" style="s2">everybody should be a Christian so we</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.769" end="00:50:21.049" style="s2">convert you or there is no place for you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.259" end="00:50:25.970" style="s2">you know we are Muslims you are infidels</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.049" end="00:50:31.039" style="s2">so let&#39;s wipe you out Jews you know you</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.970" end="00:50:33.980" style="s2">are you&#39;re going we Hindus you&#39;re 6 and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.039" end="00:50:37.730" style="s2">so on and the differences are enough to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.980" end="00:50:41.499" style="s2">kill not only between the Creed&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.730" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">inside you have here examples you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.499" end="00:50:50.329" style="s2">what can conflict between Protestants</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:52.789" style="s2">and Catholics in Ireland you have you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.329" end="00:50:55.430" style="s2">have the and this has been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.789" end="00:50:57.799" style="s2">centuries then you have Sunnis and Shias</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.430" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">would be four different systems or the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.799" end="00:51:01.099" style="s2">same creed they would be killing each</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:02.860" style="s2">other and destroying each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.099" end="00:51:06.520" style="s2">temples</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.860" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">Joseph Campbell used to say that a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.520" end="00:51:13.690" style="s2">useful deity should be transparent for</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:17.230" style="s2">the transcendent which means it should</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.690" end="00:51:19.750" style="s2">be pointing to the ultimate but not</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.230" end="00:51:21.430" style="s2">being mistaken for the militant said if</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.750" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">you make an archetype if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.430" end="00:51:29.950" style="s2">deity opaque you cannot see beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:32.650" style="s2">then you have basically idolatry and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.950" end="00:51:34.660" style="s2">then you have the the danger that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.650" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">divide the world because there will be</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.660" end="00:51:39.400" style="s2">people who would focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:42.610" style="s2">particular archetypal domain and would</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.400" end="00:51:45.940" style="s2">get into a hostile relationship so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.610" end="00:51:48.130" style="s2">need a situation where you get through</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.940" end="00:51:51.730" style="s2">the archetype to the source out of which</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.130" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">everything comes and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.730" end="00:51:57.130" style="s2">that you find in mystical branches when</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.450" end="00:51:59.980" style="s2">the organized religions get into</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.130" end="00:52:02.650" style="s2">conflict and fights the Mystics they</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.980" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">don&#39;t have any problem the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.650" end="00:52:09.310" style="s2">experiences are universal they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.420" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">all-encompassing everybody is included</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.310" end="00:52:14.650" style="s2">they don&#39;t sort of alienate the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:21.310" style="s2">and so I think what I believe we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.650" end="00:52:25.090" style="s2">true spiritual revolution in which we</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.310" end="00:52:27.730" style="s2">would give people means to have personal</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.090" end="00:52:29.670" style="s2">experiences honored the spiritual quest</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.730" end="00:52:33.270" style="s2">but would not have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.670" end="00:52:37.270" style="s2">investment in which form it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.270" end="00:52:39.820" style="s2">takes that sort of it become you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.270" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">truly global global religion rather than</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.820" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">being dividing thank you so much</p>
