<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">so right can you give a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:07.560" style="s2">examples the sort of practical</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:10.620" style="s2">implementation of mushroom technologies</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">that could help with bioremediation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.620" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">also with food security of growing fungi</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">create soils this simplest way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">describing is fungi break down rocks and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">rocks become more fragile and they</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">crumble and they have cavities that hold</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">water and so the my silly ation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">habitats retains water in the habitats</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">with retaining water you benefit plants</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">so my ciliated habitats tend to be water</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">more to be water retentive less erosion</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:38.610" style="s2">and support biological communities that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">they thrive with that an environment so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.610" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">fungi predetermined downstream many of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">the biological communities that live</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:45.329" style="s2">upon to mycelial mats are growing</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">underneath the ground practical</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.329" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">solutions would include unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">all habitats are becoming increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">more contaminated so with people wonder</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">when they buy a new tire they drive down</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:00.120" style="s2">the road and fifty thousand miles later</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">they have to buy a new tire where did</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.120" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">the hydrocarbons go they went on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">road now they&#39;re washing into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:09.450" style="s2">streams and impugning you know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">ecosystems of the fisheries you know and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">aquatic animals and birds legions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">other organisms so with these funds I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">so well as they break down plant tissue</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">especially lignin cellulose produced</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">some enzymes lignin TSA&#39;s and cellulases</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">these are a little Pacman like enzymes</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">that go around and they dismantle large</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:29.759" style="s2">molecular complexes and simpler forms</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">well by a wonderful quirk of nature the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.759" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">same enzymes break down oil and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">breaking down hydrocarbons with enzymes</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">with fungi is one way of decontaminating</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">and habitat and one test of habitat</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">toxicity is called the warm toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">test and you put a hundred worms into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">vessel with soil if it&#39;s toxic it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">toxic all the worms die and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">experiments we do mycelium onto that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">toxic soil and it breaks down the toxins</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">you put the hundred worms into the into</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">the soil that is forming toxic and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">live and reproduce that is a biological</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">test of toxicity because invertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">are especially sensitive the hydrocarbon</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">contamination there&#39;s dozens of examples</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">like that and you can use the mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">as filtration media to prevent coliform</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:14.010" style="s2">bacteria and toxic waste from flowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.849" style="s2">the downstream downs</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:19.090" style="s2">environments and so the membranes of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.849" end="00:02:21.459" style="s2">mycelium our digestive membranes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.090" end="00:02:22.900" style="s2">really externalized stomachs and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.459" end="00:02:23.980" style="s2">share a more common evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.900" end="00:02:25.390" style="s2">with fungi than we do with any other</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.980" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">kingdom splitting off from funds about</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.390" end="00:02:29.590" style="s2">650 million years ago fungi went their</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.030" end="00:02:31.329" style="s2">route of externally digesting its</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.590" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">nutrients we went the route of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.329" end="00:02:35.019" style="s2">encapsulating on nutrients within the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:37.470" style="s2">cellular sack producing digestive</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.019" end="00:02:39.609" style="s2">enzymes within and that was there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.470" end="00:02:43.829" style="s2">basically one of the major splits</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.609" end="00:02:46.900" style="s2">between fungi and animals and and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.829" end="00:02:48.670" style="s2">using these fungal membranes the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.900" end="00:02:52.389" style="s2">wonderful thing about them that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.670" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">have plasticity of use they&#39;re extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.389" end="00:02:56.950" style="s2">resilient adaptive and they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:02:58.629" style="s2">trillions upon trillions of in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.950" end="00:03:00.849" style="s2">branchings and the work of Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.629" end="00:03:03.549" style="s2">Hickey in particular has shown that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.849" end="00:03:07.239" style="s2">these mycelial membranes are are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.549" end="00:03:08.620" style="s2">advancing bundles of nuclei that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.239" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">constant migration throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.620" end="00:03:12.549" style="s2">network and if there&#39;s a new genetic</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:14.799" style="s2">expression that produces a new enzyme</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.549" end="00:03:17.349" style="s2">that&#39;s targeted again and successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.799" end="00:03:19.870" style="s2">against a new toxin what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.349" end="00:03:21.639" style="s2">well before that enzyme was produced the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.870" end="00:03:23.620" style="s2">mycelium would advance in that toxin</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.639" end="00:03:25.989" style="s2">after the enzyme is produced the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.620" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">mycelium de facto grows in that toxin</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.989" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">that then information that that Network</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">has gained is genetically encoded into</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:36.040" style="s2">the network and so these membranes learn</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">then they can learn very quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.040" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">these things are like extents you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:44.109" style="s2">mycelial interphase computers that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">constantly sorting and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.109" end="00:03:47.829" style="s2">different strategies of overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:49.930" style="s2">obstacles and we face a lot of obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.829" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">but these things are a lot smarter than</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.930" end="00:03:55.419" style="s2">we are and I think engaging my cell</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:57.400" style="s2">networks for advancing you know growing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.419" end="00:03:58.859" style="s2">food and toxic habitats preventing</p>
