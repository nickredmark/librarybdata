<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">may sound far-fetched to people who</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.079" end="00:03:13.110" style="s2">took place from the perspective of one</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">return an opportunity or a set of</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:34.470" style="s2">would reinforce let&#39;s take an example we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:38.579" style="s2">have a small number of species of salmon</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.470" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">in the Pacific they inhabit thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.579" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">different watersheds some of them very</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">large like the Columbia River some of</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.389" end="00:04:00.599" style="s2">accident would result in the fish</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.829" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">swimming into a watershed that it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.599" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">not born in and finding a mate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:09.359" style="s2">producing offspring or you could have</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.769" end="00:04:25.400" style="s2">clearly the second mode finds all of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">the actual behavior of salmon and we see</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:46.009" style="s2">this is a high expected value gamble</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:48.199" style="s2">that is to say creatures that go back to</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.530" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">they would accumulate a tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.750" end="00:06:57.370" style="s2">behave in ways that would discover big</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:07:01.210" style="s2">opportunities when they existed nearby</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.370" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">one such way is to gamble under some</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.210" end="00:07:04.930" style="s2">circumstances in not going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:07.420" style="s2">stream in which you were born in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:09.460" style="s2">case the likelihood of producing no</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.420" end="00:07:11.260" style="s2">offspring would certainly be high but</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.460" end="00:07:13.750" style="s2">the likelihood of producing a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.260" end="00:07:14.950" style="s2">surviving offspring would be higher than</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.750" end="00:07:16.810" style="s2">if you go back to the stream you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.950" end="00:07:17.980" style="s2">born in and have to compete with all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.810" end="00:07:21.580" style="s2">the other creatures who did the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.980" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">thing so the point I&#39;m trying to make is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.580" end="00:07:30.220" style="s2">that there is certainly a force that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:33.100" style="s2">favors rational exploration in design</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.220" end="00:07:35.560" style="s2">that force will be reinforced over time</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.100" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">because it will be a jumpring force from</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.560" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">an opportunity that is known to an</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:43.180" style="s2">opportunity that is unknown and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:44.410" style="s2">jump in force has to be involved in how</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.180" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">it is that the biota</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.410" end="00:07:49.150" style="s2">finds all of the remarkably different</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">ways of existing that we know it to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.150" end="00:07:56.260" style="s2">found that is a much more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:58.180" style="s2">explanation than mutations happen most</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.260" end="00:07:59.530" style="s2">of them are bad and occasionally a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.180" end="00:08:01.630" style="s2">one occurs it will be favored by</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.530" end="00:08:04.600" style="s2">selection that answer is simply not</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.630" end="00:08:06.610" style="s2">powerful enough to account for the vast</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.600" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">array of niches that have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.610" end="00:08:11.770" style="s2">discovered by species over the history</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:13.990" style="s2">of life the question is what are those</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.770" end="00:08:15.610" style="s2">mechanisms I would argue consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.990" end="00:08:18.850" style="s2">clearly is one it&#39;s one that we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.610" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">understand because we wield this but if</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.850" end="00:08:22.390" style="s2">we look out on the biota and we stop</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:24.430" style="s2">telling the story of our random mutation</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.390" end="00:08:26.590" style="s2">being the root of all progress what will</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.430" end="00:08:28.780" style="s2">be fine what would we discover if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.590" end="00:08:30.790" style="s2">thought well exploration must be out</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.780" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">there what are the mechanisms through</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.790" end="00:08:34.960" style="s2">which it takes place hey folks if you</p>
