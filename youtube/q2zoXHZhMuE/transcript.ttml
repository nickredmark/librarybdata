<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">conversation initially about performance</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:31.319" style="s2">and the article is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">Business Review article that are making</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.120" end="00:04:47.970" style="s2">actually fascinating that these</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">researchers were looking at top athletes</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.970" end="00:04:51.240" style="s2">and to see if the little corner of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:52.919" style="s2">connection between the best athletes in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.240" end="00:04:54.449" style="s2">the world and the best executives in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.919" end="00:04:57.180" style="s2">business in the world and what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.449" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">found this area commonality was recovery</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.180" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">and rituals for recovery and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:06.930" style="s2">many folks know read my book pivot I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.150" style="s2">big fan as part of the momentum section</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.930" end="00:05:11.699" style="s2">of the book I talked about resilience</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.150" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">and I also talked independently about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.699" end="00:05:16.919" style="s2">rituals but in connection with</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:20.159" style="s2">resilience the ability to bounce back</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.919" end="00:05:21.719" style="s2">from setbacks to be resilient you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.159" end="00:05:23.699" style="s2">to be that willow tree in the wind</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.719" end="00:05:27.719" style="s2">versus the oak that kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.699" end="00:05:31.530" style="s2">breaks branches break off etc well what</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.719" end="00:05:33.590" style="s2">does it mean to be resilient and and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.530" end="00:05:37.229" style="s2">know mentally emotionally spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">physically what what contributes to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.229" end="00:05:42.719" style="s2">ability to recover quickly and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.250" style="s2">wanted to get your thoughts on that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.719" end="00:05:47.009" style="s2">if you could share some some of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.250" end="00:05:50.909" style="s2">your feelings of your research in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.009" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">area that would be terrific and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.909" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:58.500" style="s2">contribute to what we call resilience or</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">the capacity for the system to continue</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.500" end="00:06:02.099" style="s2">to perform very well so rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">a homeostatic state of the system the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.099" end="00:06:06.270" style="s2">homeostatic capacity to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">operate well even in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.270" end="00:06:11.819" style="s2">stressors and one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:13.889" style="s2">important for resilience is recovery as</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.819" end="00:06:17.550" style="s2">you mentioned and so you were giving the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.889" end="00:06:19.409" style="s2">example earlier of that athletes that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.550" end="00:06:21.779" style="s2">were very successful had faster recovery</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.409" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">cycles and that means recovering from</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.779" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">heavy workouts faster but also even just</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">in short breaks between their</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">performance still within the game having</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">quicker cycles of recovery</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">heard of why this is an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.560" end="00:06:36.719" style="s2">is any kind of performance is going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:39.810" style="s2">have a certain load to it right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.719" end="00:06:41.910" style="s2">going to be a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.810" end="00:06:44.340" style="s2">physiologic processes psychologic</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.770" end="00:07:06.840" style="s2">is why sleep is such a big deal because</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.290" end="00:07:08.970" style="s2">while we are regenerating while we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.660" end="00:08:05.340" style="s2">not that long starts to lead to</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.340" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">this principle everywhere if you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.760" end="00:08:12.870" style="s2">doing agriculture and you grow crops the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:15.240" style="s2">crops are pulling nutrients out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.870" end="00:08:16.919" style="s2">soil if you take all of that crop out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.240" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">the soil and you&#39;re not tilling anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.919" end="00:08:20.430" style="s2">back into the soil so you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.430" end="00:08:24.300" style="s2">up taking fertile agricultural zones and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.979" end="00:08:26.880" style="s2">turning them into deserts and not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.300" end="00:08:28.410" style="s2">many cycles this was the Dust Bowl I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.880" end="00:08:31.620" style="s2">mean this is the lesson of the Dust Bowl</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.410" end="00:08:34.860" style="s2">era that led to wrote crop rotation</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.620" end="00:08:38.219" style="s2">right what it was the Dust Bowl yes but</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.860" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">it was the reason that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.219" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">ancient civilizations collapsed you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">one of the big parts of I think collapse</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:48.120" style="s2">was over agriculture over agriculture in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">their soil actually leading to early</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.120" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">desertification leading to resource</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:53.089" style="s2">shortage and then resource Wars and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:56.120" style="s2">whole thing so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.089" end="00:08:58.430" style="s2">he&#39;s been kind of doing that simple not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.120" end="00:08:59.930" style="s2">that long after agriculture and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.430" end="00:09:01.759" style="s2">areas that figured it out and did</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.930" end="00:09:03.079" style="s2">appropriate crop rotations and tilling</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.759" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">the nutrients back into the soil and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.079" end="00:09:06.949" style="s2">closed-loop process in other words</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:08.839" style="s2">regeneration we&#39;re able to continue</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.949" end="00:09:10.519" style="s2">because for anything to be sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.839" end="00:09:13.939" style="s2">it has to be regenerative because there</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.519" end="00:09:17.089" style="s2">is a load performance and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.939" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">true at the level of economics right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.089" end="00:09:20.899" style="s2">spending this is trade the level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:23.809" style="s2">agriculture at the level of ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.899" end="00:09:26.689" style="s2">of global fisheries you know and at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.809" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">level of psychology and physiology right</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.689" end="00:09:31.009" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about depletion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:34.100" style="s2">another word for that right because soil</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.009" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">yeah and when you talk about load I</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.100" end="00:09:36.920" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to kind of go down</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:38.569" style="s2">too many rabbit holes but what do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.920" end="00:09:42.949" style="s2">what do you mean by the lay before me</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.569" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">well the when you&#39;re taking nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.949" end="00:09:46.220" style="s2">out of the soil converting them into</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:48.589" style="s2">plants and taking the plants out of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.220" end="00:09:53.660" style="s2">soil there is a load to the soil right</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.589" end="00:09:56.329" style="s2">there is a burden of how much toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.660" end="00:09:58.189" style="s2">can get into the soil of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.329" end="00:09:59.870" style="s2">byproducts of the plants and how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.189" end="00:10:02.389" style="s2">nutrient can get taken out of the soil</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.870" end="00:10:05.449" style="s2">basically there&#39;s a cost right so then</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.389" end="00:10:07.429" style="s2">we have to regenerate proportionally to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.449" end="00:10:09.350" style="s2">be able to stay even regenerate more to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.429" end="00:10:12.620" style="s2">get ahead this would be the same with</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.350" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">our physiology so if you know someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.620" end="00:10:16.429" style="s2">lifting weights they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:18.920" style="s2">inducing micro tears in the muscle which</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.429" end="00:10:21.800" style="s2">then induce regeneration of the muscle</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.920" end="00:10:24.350" style="s2">where it regenerates you know with more</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.800" end="00:10:25.850" style="s2">actual tissue fibers and more densely</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.350" end="00:10:27.829" style="s2">bundled tissue fibers which is why</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.850" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">strength increases but if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.829" end="00:10:32.509" style="s2">adequate nutrition and adequate time</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:34.579" style="s2">adequate circulation and support etc for</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.509" end="00:10:36.529" style="s2">the regeneration then those micro tears</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.579" end="00:10:41.240" style="s2">can turn into bigger tears and injury</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.529" end="00:10:43.699" style="s2">rather than into regeneration and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.240" end="00:10:48.620" style="s2">have faster cycles of regeneration then</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.699" end="00:10:50.199" style="s2">you can actually continue right so what</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.620" end="00:10:52.779" style="s2">do you believe it is that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.199" end="00:10:56.389" style="s2">contributes to faster</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.779" end="00:10:58.910" style="s2">creating a faster cycle of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.389" end="00:11:00.350" style="s2">because maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.910" end="00:11:04.009" style="s2">out of this is that you&#39;re saying you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.350" end="00:11:06.460" style="s2">can actually impact the cycle in there I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.009" end="00:11:08.910" style="s2">guess and to regenerate more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.460" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">it&#39;s actually degenerate more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.910" end="00:11:13.210" style="s2">well I think that there&#39;s a number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:16.510" style="s2">things the first is to degenerate less</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.210" end="00:11:18.580" style="s2">quickly right so if when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.510" end="00:11:20.680" style="s2">generation is the law we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.580" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">about there&#39;s nothing we can do about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:25.390" style="s2">the fact that that we are to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:29.110" style="s2">generating no matter what it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.390" end="00:11:33.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a universal law is that yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.110" end="00:11:34.750" style="s2">a lot we can do about it there is it so</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.010" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">the second law of thermodynamics which I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.750" end="00:11:39.130" style="s2">think is what you&#39;re referring to is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">idea that entropy is going to increase</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.130" end="00:11:44.410" style="s2">in any closed system yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:45.160" style="s2">humans are not closed systems is a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.410" end="00:11:47.170" style="s2">important topic</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:51.910" style="s2">we&#39;re in taking new energy all the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.170" end="00:11:54.070" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re actually releasing all you</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.910" end="00:11:57.730" style="s2">know structures and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.070" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">definitions of life core definitions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.730" end="00:12:02.860" style="s2">what life is in biology is an entropy</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:06.250" style="s2">externalizing system or an enthalpy pump</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.860" end="00:12:07.990" style="s2">and so like you think about the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.250" end="00:12:10.390" style="s2">one says things are going to get more</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.990" end="00:12:12.490" style="s2">and more disorderly but biology is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.390" end="00:12:14.440" style="s2">process of making orderly things right</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.490" end="00:12:16.570" style="s2">so a plant has these very complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.440" end="00:12:17.860" style="s2">molecules that are organizing from very</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.570" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">simple molecules how does it do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.860" end="00:12:21.100" style="s2">there&#39;s always been this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:25.090" style="s2">question about how life seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.100" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">simply anti-entropic and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.090" end="00:12:27.670" style="s2">violating the second law but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:31.080" style="s2">working with it in a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.670" end="00:12:34.390" style="s2">way where it&#39;s taking energy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.080" end="00:12:36.640" style="s2">externalizing entropy and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.390" end="00:12:38.590" style="s2">have self-organization as a result so</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.640" end="00:12:40.180" style="s2">it&#39;s important to get there since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.590" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">not closed systems the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.180" end="00:12:46.330" style="s2">just subject to fixed entropy is not</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">really true now we are subject to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.330" end="00:12:50.170" style="s2">entropy all the time but you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:52.930" style="s2">decrease the entropic load so we look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:55.960" style="s2">what is it that ages us though oxidative</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.930" end="00:12:57.520" style="s2">stress ages us toxicity of various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.960" end="00:13:00.370" style="s2">ages as these are things that can damage</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.520" end="00:13:02.620" style="s2">cells and then lead to you know damaged</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.370" end="00:13:05.710" style="s2">cells or senescence right cells older</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.620" end="00:13:07.450" style="s2">cells but all basically here means has</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.710" end="00:13:09.610" style="s2">some damage so it doesn&#39;t function in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.450" end="00:13:11.380" style="s2">the same way so it produces metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.610" end="00:13:13.690" style="s2">byproducts that end up being harmful it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.380" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do all the healthy process as</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.690" end="00:13:19.480" style="s2">well so can we decrease oxidative stress</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:20.270" style="s2">yes can we increase how well our body</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.480" end="00:13:21.860" style="s2">recovers</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.270" end="00:13:24.980" style="s2">from oxidative stress through better</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.860" end="00:13:27.500" style="s2">antioxidant support and pathways yes can</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.980" end="00:13:30.290" style="s2">we decrease toxic burden yeah can we</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.500" end="00:13:33.560" style="s2">increase our detox systems pathways</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.290" end="00:13:35.450" style="s2">totally can we decrease psychological</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.560" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">stress and increase our psychological</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.450" end="00:13:41.060" style="s2">process absolutely can we make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:42.920" style="s2">where there are deficiencies of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.060" end="00:13:44.150" style="s2">nutrients or other forms of stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.920" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">that are necessary for system</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.150" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">optimization that we address that so</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:50.780" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing a deficiency yes so then</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:53.110" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s of course still</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.780" end="00:13:56.500" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.110" end="00:13:58.690" style="s2">entropy happening but we can navigate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:01.810" style="s2">profoundly better yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.690" end="00:14:03.910" style="s2">fascinating I&#39;m gonna ask you have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.810" end="00:14:05.110" style="s2">funny question it&#39;s just coming up so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.910" end="00:14:07.060" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna ask it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.110" end="00:14:10.450" style="s2">is it theoretically possible that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.060" end="00:14:13.960" style="s2">that humans could live or work and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.450" end="00:14:16.360" style="s2">what&#39;s it what&#39;s what&#39;s the is there an</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.960" end="00:14:19.060" style="s2">outer edge to how long a human being can</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.360" end="00:14:21.450" style="s2">live you know what you&#39;re saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.060" end="00:14:24.730" style="s2">we can control that entropic process</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.450" end="00:14:28.510" style="s2">this is one of the most active questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.730" end="00:14:31.030" style="s2">in kind of the biomedical sciences world</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.510" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">right now is not just medicine focused</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.030" end="00:14:34.960" style="s2">on disease model but the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2">longevity and radical life extension</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.960" end="00:14:39.790" style="s2">itself is a totally new approach to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">biology and to the degree that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.790" end="00:14:44.980" style="s2">address the dynamics of longevity we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.020" style="s2">also end up addressing the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.980" end="00:14:49.710" style="s2">preventing the things that kill us rain</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.020" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">so medicine can kind of get obsolete it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.710" end="00:14:55.390" style="s2">much of medicine is just obsoleted in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:57.130" style="s2">the process of optimizing ongoing system</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.390" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">efficiency you know one function which</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.130" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">can lead to life extension give or take</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">genetic maximum for most people is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:07.420" style="s2">usually thought of in the hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:09.220" style="s2">ten hundred and twenty kind of range</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.420" end="00:15:11.410" style="s2">which is the oldest we see people make</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">it that we have documentary kurds of and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.410" end="00:15:17.320" style="s2">most people don&#39;t live that long and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:19.690" style="s2">most people are dying earlier than</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.320" end="00:15:21.400" style="s2">genetic maximum because of specific</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.690" end="00:15:24.010" style="s2">issues and so they&#39;re dying of cancer or</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.400" end="00:15:26.260" style="s2">heart disease or diabetes whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.010" end="00:15:28.780" style="s2">so the first step in life extension is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.260" end="00:15:30.550" style="s2">just preventing those causes of death</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.780" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">and so everybody starts to get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.550" end="00:15:36.310" style="s2">genetic maximum it&#39;s very realistic that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:39.390" style="s2">that will become scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.310" end="00:15:43.150" style="s2">plausible in the next not many years and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.390" end="00:15:44.830" style="s2">that you know premature death from</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.150" end="00:15:49.030" style="s2">disease will become a part of history</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.830" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s something that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.030" end="00:15:53.260" style="s2">are a number of companies doing really</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:55.840" style="s2">pioneering great work on and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.260" end="00:15:59.020" style="s2">working to add to research in that space</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.840" end="00:16:01.060" style="s2">yeah beautiful leaving us beyond genetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.020" end="00:16:03.610" style="s2">maximum beyond that hundred and twenty</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.060" end="00:16:06.070" style="s2">is a totally different topic because</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.610" end="00:16:08.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a big question right now on</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.070" end="00:16:10.390" style="s2">is it simply accumulated stressors that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.650" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">are leading to when we die and we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.390" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">just stop having those stressors or is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:17.770" style="s2">death actually genetically programmed as</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:19.870" style="s2">a way to keep natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.770" end="00:16:22.780" style="s2">happening right and so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.870" end="00:16:25.540" style="s2">have the older species competing with</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.780" end="00:16:27.280" style="s2">the newer ones for the same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.540" end="00:16:28.930" style="s2">finite resource when the newer ones have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.280" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">better genetics because they&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.930" end="00:16:33.730" style="s2">through you know more breeding cycles it</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.230" style="s2">there&#39;s pretty good evidence that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.730" end="00:16:37.690" style="s2">are aspects of death that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:39.220" style="s2">genetically programmed and but this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.690" end="00:16:41.320" style="s2">one of the topics of debate between</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.220" end="00:16:45.490" style="s2">different researchers in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.320" end="00:16:47.710" style="s2">radical life extension and so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.490" end="00:16:49.960" style="s2">the case it&#39;s work that&#39;s being done on</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:54.010" style="s2">how would we actually change genetically</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.960" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">programmed F and given that we&#39;re in you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:16:58.150" style="s2">know Chris the post CRISPR world where</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:01.990" style="s2">we are working on being able to identify</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.150" end="00:17:05.440" style="s2">gene sequences and change them the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.990" end="00:17:06.520" style="s2">that we will extend longevity up to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.440" end="00:17:08.680" style="s2">kind of hundred and twenty mark</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.520" end="00:17:11.829" style="s2">regularly and maybe beyond that is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.680" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">realistic interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.829" end="00:17:18.550" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller was pretty on target</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:20.949" style="s2">with a lot of his predictions and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.550" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">was one of them you know so yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.949" end="00:17:27.490" style="s2">remains to be seen for us but yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:31.360" style="s2">the topic of regeneration it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.490" end="00:17:33.940" style="s2">that if you pull back far enough depth</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.360" end="00:17:36.520" style="s2">death we can partically generally the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.940" end="00:17:39.160" style="s2">regenerative cycle anyway right i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.520" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">would definitely remove death from that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.160" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">cycle any of that maybe there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">answering your question but just like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:47.500" style="s2">this the cells of your body are dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2">and new ones are being born and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.500" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">regeneration of your whole system is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:56.200" style="s2">happening that way but how life</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:58.330" style="s2">extension technologies are working is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.200" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">actually help the old cells die faster</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.330" end="00:18:02.980" style="s2">so that they aren&#39;t underperforming</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:06.280" style="s2">causing metabolic problems and new cells</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.980" end="00:18:08.350" style="s2">come in faster so if you can body has a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.280" end="00:18:11.680" style="s2">natural process for killing old cells</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.350" end="00:18:13.900" style="s2">because if the old cells keep and buy</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.680" end="00:18:17.170" style="s2">old what we mean is they are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.900" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">damaged their metabolic processes are</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.170" end="00:18:21.000" style="s2">somewhat damaged so rather than pretty</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:24.690" style="s2">ATP cleanly and have clean genetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.000" end="00:18:27.390" style="s2">transcription they end up having damage</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.690" end="00:18:30.390" style="s2">in genetic transcription ie cancer</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.390" end="00:18:31.769" style="s2">probability and over producing histamine</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.390" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">which leads to inflammation or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.769" end="00:18:37.230" style="s2">things like that so autophagy is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">process by which the body identifies and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.230" end="00:18:40.850" style="s2">can kill older cells there are things</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.049" style="s2">that we can do to actually increase</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.850" end="00:18:45.049" style="s2">autophagy so that we aren&#39;t dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.049" end="00:18:49.380" style="s2">the problems of senescence cells so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.049" end="00:18:51.350" style="s2">fasting actually triggers you know as</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.380" end="00:18:53.460" style="s2">soon as the body&#39;s in caloric deficit</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.350" end="00:18:56.010" style="s2">significant Klerk deficit for a while it</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.460" end="00:18:57.419" style="s2">starts cutting life supports to certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.010" end="00:18:59.220" style="s2">systems and it actually cuts it to old</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.419" end="00:19:00.950" style="s2">senescent mewn cells first which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.220" end="00:19:04.470" style="s2">great super helpful things so</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.950" end="00:19:06.330" style="s2">interesting research on 72-hour mark</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.470" end="00:19:07.830" style="s2">water fasts and we start getting purge</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.330" end="00:19:10.380" style="s2">of senesin immune cells which caused</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.830" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">major inflammatory and autoimmune kinds</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.380" end="00:19:14.130" style="s2">of issues so great there are also drugs</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">and herbs and things that are being</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.130" end="00:19:18.779" style="s2">worked on to do that but if you our body</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.100" end="00:19:20.909" style="s2">is actually producing new stem cells all</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.779" end="00:19:22.980" style="s2">the time and those new stem cells are</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.909" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">then differentiating into tissues if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.980" end="00:19:27.059" style="s2">could increase the rate at which we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">produce themselves which means new stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.059" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">being born and we could increase the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:31.350" style="s2">rate at which those differentiate into</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:34.919" style="s2">tissues and increase the rate at which</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.350" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">the old cells are recycled and then also</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.919" end="00:19:39.480" style="s2">protect healthy cells from damage well</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:41.669" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different system right</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.480" end="00:19:45.389" style="s2">yes you at the level of a human body</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.669" end="00:19:47.010" style="s2">it&#39;s also true at the level of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.389" end="00:19:49.649" style="s2">and civilization so there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.010" end="00:19:51.480" style="s2">this place where one of the really</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.649" end="00:19:54.210" style="s2">interesting philosophic questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.480" end="00:19:56.279" style="s2">ethical questions in life extension is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.210" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">would it be a net good thing for</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.279" end="00:20:03.480" style="s2">civilization because if older people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.220" style="s2">rate of learning decreases and younger</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.480" end="00:20:07.950" style="s2">people have higher rate of learning if</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.220" end="00:20:09.630" style="s2">you keep older people are alive longer</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">and then you can have less younger</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.630" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">people right you&#39;ve got to have less</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:15.179" style="s2">birth rate to have a steady-state</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:17.130" style="s2">population do you have more people that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.179" end="00:20:19.080" style="s2">are obsolete for a longer period of time</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.130" end="00:20:23.010" style="s2">and that are less adapted to the new</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.080" end="00:20:25.260" style="s2">world that&#39;s changing faster but or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.010" end="00:20:27.570" style="s2">other perspective would say we actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.260" end="00:20:29.940" style="s2">only start to meaningfully mature around</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.570" end="00:20:31.770" style="s2">the time we die and that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.940" end="00:20:32.520" style="s2">understand how to navigate universe or</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.770" end="00:20:34.920" style="s2">even are so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.520" end="00:20:36.059" style="s2">very well for most of our early life and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.920" end="00:20:37.800" style="s2">that if we could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.059" end="00:20:39.000" style="s2">regenerating our physiology well enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.800" end="00:20:40.770" style="s2">that those older years were still</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.000" end="00:20:43.190" style="s2">actually vital and that our learning was</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.770" end="00:20:47.070" style="s2">optimized that people who could live to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.190" end="00:20:49.110" style="s2">150 etc would have basically a much</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.070" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">longer developmental childhood and in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.110" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">much longer period of productivity with</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.800" style="s2">a much more comprehensive human</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:57.330" style="s2">development set so without answering</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.800" end="00:20:58.440" style="s2">which of those it is or the dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.330" end="00:21:00.360" style="s2">between that and say that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.440" end="00:21:02.520" style="s2">interesting question it is it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:04.410" style="s2">conversation maybe this explains even</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.520" end="00:21:06.390" style="s2">why there&#39;s so many I&#39;m gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.410" end="00:21:08.100" style="s2">joke here but so many thirty and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.390" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">plus year olds living still living in</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.100" end="00:21:13.890" style="s2">their parents basements well there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">question that we breed older than we</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.890" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">used to right so we went from breeding</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:20.490" style="s2">throughout much of history pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:23.059" style="s2">as soon as breeding was possible right</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.490" end="00:21:25.590" style="s2">as soon as we went past puberty to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.059" end="00:21:27.179" style="s2">having economics and education and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.590" end="00:21:29.730" style="s2">social structures start changing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.179" end="00:21:34.020" style="s2">we&#39;re thirty and moving towards forty</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.730" end="00:21:36.600" style="s2">you know are are getting much more</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.020" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">common and while we&#39;re being exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.600" end="00:21:40.650" style="s2">more information earlier and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:42.390" style="s2">whether they&#39;re having babies later in</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.650" end="00:21:44.280" style="s2">life and I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.390" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">must be studies that attract that but</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.280" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">just seems like anecdotally we see</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:50.970" style="s2">clothes that have had babies right up to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.309" style="s2">the kind of fifty which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.970" end="00:21:55.800" style="s2">remarkable actually it&#39;s actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.309" end="00:21:59.970" style="s2">the really also deep ethical topics and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.800" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">life extension is without extending</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.970" end="00:22:09.059" style="s2">menopause because if it already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.950" style="s2">sucks women basically are gonna have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.059" end="00:22:13.170" style="s2">decision parents or not and it has to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.950" end="00:22:14.910" style="s2">end it forty or maybe a little somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.170" end="00:22:17.190" style="s2">into their forties and men could make</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:19.320" style="s2">that decision much later there is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.190" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">of biologic inequality in choice making</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.320" end="00:22:23.400" style="s2">capacity where he can do other than</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:26.730" style="s2">parenting things for much longer</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.400" end="00:22:29.940" style="s2">preparatory she hasn&#39;t been able to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.730" end="00:22:32.040" style="s2">that right so extending not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.940" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">longevity but extending reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.040" end="00:22:37.140" style="s2">longevity is one of the very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:39.030" style="s2">topics to yeah well well I&#39;m gonna bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.140" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">us back to the hips of the original</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.030" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">point of our discussion which was</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:46.419" style="s2">resilience I&#39;m a big fan of recipes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:50.409" style="s2">formulas I know you think formulas</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.419" end="00:22:52.840" style="s2">- so I&#39;m just gonna ask you it with with</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.409" end="00:22:54.940" style="s2">just a few ingredients what would your</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.840" end="00:22:56.919" style="s2">formula for resilience be and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.940" end="00:22:59.080" style="s2">already spoken about one which was sleep</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.919" end="00:23:00.730" style="s2">so what are some of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.080" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">that you think are really key because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.730" end="00:23:05.080" style="s2">believe and that&#39;s you know the results</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:07.809" style="s2">of that studying at Harvard study they</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.080" end="00:23:09.909" style="s2">go really telling and when I counsel</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.809" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">people on you know their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.909" end="00:23:13.179" style="s2">pivot make changes in their life</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.159" style="s2">whatever it is you know sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.179" end="00:23:17.559" style="s2">enter people in business as well and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.159" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve just got to be able to recover</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.559" end="00:23:22.659" style="s2">quickly I mean this constantly setbacks</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:24.759" style="s2">the rate of disruption the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.659" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">change is exponentially greater all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.759" end="00:23:28.600" style="s2">time then you just have to be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:32.650" style="s2">resilient so you know what what is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.600" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">what would that recipe look like for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.650" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">well even though I didn&#39;t get read the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:42.580" style="s2">article yeah just as you shared it with</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:45.850" style="s2">me they spoke about physical emotional</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.580" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">mental spiritual resilience and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.850" end="00:23:50.920" style="s2">there were relationships between each of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:53.470" style="s2">those and that you&#39;ve got kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.920" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of those resilience</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.470" end="00:23:57.780" style="s2">types</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:24:00.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s meaningful topic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.780" end="00:24:04.570" style="s2">physical resilience is necessary but not</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.790" end="00:24:07.210" style="s2">sufficient so if someone is eating well</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.570" end="00:24:09.220" style="s2">sleeping well exercising well and doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.210" end="00:24:11.410" style="s2">good preventive and integrative medicine</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.220" end="00:24:13.390" style="s2">for optimum physiology that&#39;s gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.410" end="00:24:16.150" style="s2">a huge difference because physiology</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.390" end="00:24:18.160" style="s2">affects emotion and cognition emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.150" end="00:24:22.510" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be very affected pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.160" end="00:24:24.520" style="s2">everyone who has felt their physiology</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.510" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">out of balance for any reason whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.520" end="00:24:28.750" style="s2">their hormones were out of balance or</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.130" end="00:24:30.850" style="s2">they felt in their chemistry the balance</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.750" end="00:24:33.460" style="s2">or they had you know infection going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.850" end="00:24:36.460" style="s2">knows that their emotions and their</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.460" end="00:24:37.630" style="s2">cognition were inexorably affected right</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.460" end="00:24:39.580" style="s2">there are certain emotional states are</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.630" end="00:24:43.690" style="s2">just like not accessible and other ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.580" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">that were unavoidable and so almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.690" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">think of the physiology is like being</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:49.420" style="s2">tunable like a musical instrument where</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">if it&#39;s out of tune and all the music is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.420" end="00:24:53.800" style="s2">messed up right and so before we even</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.120" end="00:24:58.059" style="s2">talk about upgrading the instrument just</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.800" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">having it in tune makes a difference but</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.059" end="00:25:01.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not sufficient right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:02.440" style="s2">kind of hardware layers and we start</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.090" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">looking at the software the software</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.440" end="00:25:07.929" style="s2">layer of how we make mean what we focus</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:09.309" style="s2">on where our attention goes what our</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.929" end="00:25:12.429" style="s2">frameworks for understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.309" end="00:25:16.210" style="s2">perspective taking are and so when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.429" end="00:25:18.220" style="s2">start so physical resilience suggests</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.210" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">for recipes let&#39;s just kind of address</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.220" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">that even though I think the basic</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:24.970" style="s2">things everybody knows and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:29.050" style="s2">I&#39;ll add some novel things basic things</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.970" end="00:25:32.290" style="s2">are true and they said the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.050" end="00:25:35.559" style="s2">sleep and I would put sleep in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.290" end="00:25:38.590" style="s2">category separate from nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.559" end="00:25:42.520" style="s2">exercise and everything else in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.590" end="00:25:44.140" style="s2">its overall importance and I&#39;m not under</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.520" end="00:25:45.850" style="s2">weighting the importance of the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.140" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">ones I&#39;m just actually weighting as</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.850" end="00:25:49.390" style="s2">heavily</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:52.420" style="s2">should be weighted or asleep because</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.390" end="00:25:53.890" style="s2">given that almost all physiologic repair</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.420" end="00:25:56.190" style="s2">and regeneration happens during sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.890" end="00:25:58.780" style="s2">the whole purpose of nutrients is to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.190" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">regenerate new tissues etc means it can</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.780" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">happen that&#39;s gonna be major part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">what happens the exercise the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:06.220" style="s2">regeneration is can occur as large</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:09.250" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be during that time so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.220" end="00:26:11.050" style="s2">if people are sleeping not enough or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.250" end="00:26:13.290" style="s2">sleeping well I would say it should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.050" end="00:26:16.260" style="s2">their first priority to address that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.290" end="00:26:18.700" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do here we&#39;ll talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.260" end="00:26:20.950" style="s2">be happy to do that at some time but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.700" end="00:26:23.290" style="s2">would put it as a Tier one I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.950" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">to hear that because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.290" end="00:26:28.030" style="s2"> that we want to do that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:30.910" style="s2">most uninteresting thing if it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.030" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">like to use our hours but having all the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.910" end="00:26:35.590" style="s2">rest of our hours in tune makes a much</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:38.110" style="s2">bigger difference than having more</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.590" end="00:26:39.670" style="s2">shitty hours yeah this is what inspired</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.110" end="00:26:41.710" style="s2">me earlier because before we hit the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.670" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">record button folks we were having this</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.710" end="00:26:45.640" style="s2">conversation because I asked then how</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:47.560" style="s2">many hours do you sleep and he said you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.640" end="00:26:49.390" style="s2">know 8/8 the right number for me and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.560" end="00:26:50.980" style="s2">it&#39;s anybody that&#39;s telling you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.390" end="00:26:52.870" style="s2">differently it&#39;s kind of you know full</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.980" end="00:26:56.830" style="s2">of it on some level I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.870" end="00:26:58.420" style="s2">they&#39;re outliers for sure but but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.830" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think people can</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.420" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">hear it enough even though if you said</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:03.430" style="s2">it&#39;s basic I think people need the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:06.520" style="s2">reminder and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.430" end="00:27:08.800" style="s2">providing that reminder like and some</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.520" end="00:27:11.230" style="s2">people really focus on when you sleep</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.800" end="00:27:14.950" style="s2">early to sleep early to rise kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.230" end="00:27:16.660" style="s2">dynamics I think that is a good thing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.950" end="00:27:20.890" style="s2">explore but I don&#39;t stress on that too</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.660" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">much if some I think you should find out</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.890" end="00:27:24.760" style="s2">when you feel like you perform the best</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:27.460" style="s2">because there is a meaningful reason to</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.760" end="00:27:30.520" style="s2">think that most humans are diurnal</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.460" end="00:27:32.290" style="s2">animals your daytime animals where our</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.520" end="00:27:38.770" style="s2">circadian rhythm is in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.290" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">light and and that the quality of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:43.180" style="s2">that happens in dark is better than not</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:48.060" style="s2">bargain I think that&#39;s a general truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.180" end="00:27:48.060" style="s2">it also does appear that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.120" end="00:27:54.610" style="s2">subpopulations that are genetically</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.310" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">adapted for sleeping waking up earlier</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.610" end="00:27:59.680" style="s2">and waking up later that we&#39;ll probably</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.450" end="00:28:08.980" style="s2">actually works best for you go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">hide right then do make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.980" end="00:28:12.250" style="s2">sleeping enough sleeping enough means</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:15.930" style="s2">you can wake up without an alarm</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.250" end="00:28:18.190" style="s2">energized and if you wake and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.930" end="00:28:19.690" style="s2">sustainably because anyone when they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:29.950" style="s2">that&#39;s enough sleep if it&#39;s less than</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.250" end="00:28:31.150" style="s2">that you might wish that you needed less</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.950" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">sleep than that and there are things you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.150" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">can do with your health they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">decrease Leaney because you have less to</p>

<p begin="00:28:52.150" end="00:28:55.420" style="s2">because it just got more than that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.260" end="00:28:56.530" style="s2">repaired yeah and stress I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.420" end="00:28:58.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that that article</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.530" end="00:29:01.750" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s pretty key I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.510" end="00:29:03.160" style="s2">the stress involved in being and and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.750" end="00:29:06.160" style="s2">people listen to this for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.160" end="00:29:08.170" style="s2">and almost everybody I know is under</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.160" end="00:29:10.030" style="s2">greater stress now than then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.170" end="00:29:11.800" style="s2">ever before I mean there&#39;s entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.030" end="00:29:13.270" style="s2">people in business whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.800" end="00:29:15.280" style="s2">working in somebody else&#39;s business but</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.270" end="00:29:16.690" style="s2">there&#39;s just more plate spinning you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.280" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">know with family and work and everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.690" end="00:29:21.900" style="s2">else so if it feels like this more</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:24.730" style="s2">there&#39;s more stress which would will</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.900" end="00:29:28.180" style="s2">seemingly require a better system to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.730" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">repair and recover in and regenerate and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.180" end="00:29:33.730" style="s2">as you said mentally emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.700" end="00:29:35.140" style="s2">spiritually and physically so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.730" end="00:29:38.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve got stress on each of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.140" end="00:29:41.380" style="s2">dimensions right physiologic stress can</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.110" end="00:29:43.480" style="s2">come from toxins in the environment from</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.380" end="00:29:46.810" style="s2">physical stress from injury from</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.480" end="00:29:49.060" style="s2">exercise from poor posture from too much</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.810" end="00:29:53.260" style="s2">computer hours from not enough exercise</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.060" end="00:29:55.750" style="s2">leading the circulation issues from all</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.260" end="00:29:57.670" style="s2">of those are sources of extra</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.750" end="00:30:00.160" style="s2">physiologic stress than is just a given</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.670" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">and so I would say decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.160" end="00:30:05.860" style="s2">physiologic stressors while increasing</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">physiologic regeneration is key but you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.860" end="00:30:13.150" style="s2">want to eat food less inflammatory stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.130" end="00:30:19.330" style="s2">less artificial anything less sugar</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.150" end="00:30:20.980" style="s2">more micronutrients in general that in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.330" end="00:30:22.990" style="s2">general people do better with less</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.980" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">calories than they used to eating unless</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.990" end="00:30:28.990" style="s2">people are really severely under eating</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:31.140" style="s2">but caloric restriction is still the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.990" end="00:30:34.660" style="s2">main thing we know about life extension</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.660" end="00:30:40.360" style="s2">periodic fasting is intermittent fasting</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.090" end="00:30:43.270" style="s2">is one way of achieving in but diets</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.360" end="00:30:45.100" style="s2">that had about 30% less calorie than was</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.270" end="00:30:48.670" style="s2">normally considered adequate so calorie</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.100" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">means macronutrient sugar fat no carbs</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:30:56.050" style="s2">a number of reasons increased</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.260" end="00:30:59.170" style="s2">ampk levels and activation of sirtuin</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.050" end="00:31:00.730" style="s2">genes and things like that so but we</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.170" end="00:31:03.160" style="s2">want most of micronutrients vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.730" end="00:31:04.929" style="s2">minerals enzymes so if we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.160" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">a diet that is higher in micronutrients</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.929" end="00:31:09.160" style="s2">and lower in total calorie they will in</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.900" end="00:32:51.890" style="s2">stress in terms of mechanical physics</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:54.110" style="s2">right mechanical stressors stress</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.890" end="00:32:57.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just mean an emotional or mental</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.110" end="00:32:59.960" style="s2">thing stress means any force on a system</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.920" end="00:33:02.330" style="s2">that if it gets high enough will produce</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.960" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">an alteration of that system right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.330" end="00:33:06.110" style="s2">alteration is what we call strain and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:08.059" style="s2">physics stress is the force that will</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.110" end="00:33:10.400" style="s2">lead to strain if the stress gets higher</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.059" end="00:33:15.380" style="s2">than the dynamic capacity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.400" end="00:33:17.240" style="s2">to endure and so that&#39;s a kind of wider</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.380" end="00:33:18.740" style="s2">way to think about what stress means and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:21.530" style="s2">so then we have destructive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.740" end="00:33:24.260" style="s2">constructive types of stress and so when</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.530" end="00:33:28.610" style="s2">we work out we&#39;re stressing a muscle but</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.260" end="00:33:30.820" style="s2">if we stress it where it is within a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.610" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">range that we can recover and then we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.820" end="00:33:35.750" style="s2">adequate things to support recovery then</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:37.790" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is the system&#39;s as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.750" end="00:33:39.860" style="s2">I&#39;m not adapted to be able to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.790" end="00:33:42.230" style="s2">this kind of stimulus so I need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.860" end="00:33:44.360" style="s2">change to be able to adapt to it so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.230" end="00:33:46.370" style="s2">gains bigger you know develops bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.360" end="00:33:48.500" style="s2">muscles to deal with the stimulus called</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.370" end="00:33:51.020" style="s2">heavy weight and this is why I like wim</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.500" end="00:33:53.570" style="s2">Hof&#39;s work in cryotherapy cold therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.020" end="00:33:56.540" style="s2">is very interesting if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.570" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">in our evolutionary environment we for</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.540" end="00:34:01.100" style="s2">air conditioners and heaters we were</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.270" end="00:34:03.350" style="s2">regulating our own body temperature</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.100" end="00:34:08.060" style="s2">means some through clothes and but</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.350" end="00:34:10.280" style="s2">largely our own metabolism changed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.060" end="00:34:11.929" style="s2">deal with external temperature much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.280" end="00:34:14.899" style="s2">dynamically than it does not</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.929" end="00:34:17.470" style="s2">and so as warm-blooded creatures how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.899" end="00:34:19.519" style="s2">we get warm well we we could you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.470" end="00:34:21.289" style="s2">catabolism is the force where we break</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.519" end="00:34:24.440" style="s2">molecules and release energy and heat</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.289" end="00:34:25.579" style="s2">from it and so if it&#39;s cold and we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.440" end="00:34:27.139" style="s2">to actually generate more heat that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.579" end="00:34:29.179" style="s2">means we need to increase those</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.139" end="00:34:32.929" style="s2">metabolic processes that means we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.179" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">to increase the thyroid hormones the you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.929" end="00:34:36.200" style="s2">know the sex hormones etc that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.329" style="s2">involved in doing that and those</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.200" end="00:34:39.740" style="s2">catabolic processes if it&#39;s too hot we</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.329" end="00:34:41.929" style="s2">need to cool down we need to change</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.740" end="00:34:43.549" style="s2">other metabolic you know and cooling</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.929" end="00:34:45.319" style="s2">processes so it&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.549" end="00:34:46.909" style="s2">worked like if you don&#39;t press the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.319" end="00:34:48.679" style="s2">system enough it will lose capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.909" end="00:34:51.529" style="s2">because there&#39;s no evolutionary purpose</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.679" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">for it to keep the capacity but and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.529" end="00:34:55.970" style="s2">this is what we would call adaptive or</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">healthy stress just saying hey this is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.970" end="00:34:59.150" style="s2">kind of thing that this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:00.799" style="s2">stimulus that we&#39;re going to keep being</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.150" end="00:35:03.740" style="s2">exposed to so we need the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.799" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">respond to it but if I put myself in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.740" end="00:35:09.559" style="s2">cold bath or a cold chamber where I can</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:11.089" style="s2">produce enough heat if I put myself in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.559" end="00:35:13.670" style="s2">amount of cold that I don&#39;t really feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.089" end="00:35:15.559" style="s2">any stress from the system can all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.670" end="00:35:16.609" style="s2">its current capacity can already handle</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.559" end="00:35:18.859" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t need to upregulate</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.609" end="00:35:20.749" style="s2">capacity it has to actually be at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.859" end="00:35:22.609" style="s2">edge of my current capacity so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.749" end="00:35:24.410" style="s2">system says hey we need to I bring it</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.609" end="00:35:26.089" style="s2">capacity will deal with this but it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.410" end="00:35:27.980" style="s2">to not be so far beyond the edge that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.089" end="00:35:30.859" style="s2">causes damage ie frostbite or</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.980" end="00:35:32.329" style="s2">hypothermia here we&#39;re lifting in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.859" end="00:35:36.019" style="s2">where you damage a tendon rather than</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.329" end="00:35:38.150" style="s2">micro tears and muscle so healthy stress</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.019" end="00:35:40.009" style="s2">is where you expose yourselves twist</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.150" end="00:35:42.319" style="s2">stimulus that is beyond your current</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.009" end="00:35:45.380" style="s2">capacity to manage easily that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.319" end="00:35:47.900" style="s2">the system up regulating its capacity in</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.380" end="00:35:51.619" style="s2">a way that you actually can up regulate</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.900" end="00:35:53.059" style="s2">in relationship to damaging stress is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.619" end="00:35:54.499" style="s2">where you can&#39;t up regulate in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.059" end="00:35:57.619" style="s2">relationship to it you don&#39;t do what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.499" end="00:35:59.299" style="s2">necessary or it&#39;s just too far out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.619" end="00:35:59.989" style="s2">then the system actually just down</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.299" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">regulates</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.989" end="00:36:08.329" style="s2">from going into strain this needs repair</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:09.829" style="s2">at that point it needs more repair than</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.329" end="00:36:12.980" style="s2">it can get so it&#39;s damaged</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.829" end="00:36:14.900" style="s2">what is it irreparable in that instance</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.980" end="00:36:18.289" style="s2">dependence is a torn tendon irreparable</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.900" end="00:36:19.759" style="s2">nono but if you know up to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.289" end="00:36:22.249" style="s2">point yes beyond that point right</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.759" end="00:36:24.799" style="s2">without surgery or some other artificial</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.249" end="00:36:25.650" style="s2">means right so two things that just come</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.799" end="00:36:28.529" style="s2">up for me and I want</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.650" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">so one is this the you know the side of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.529" end="00:36:32.819" style="s2">unit that works in a personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:35.789" style="s2">development and business tacoman arena</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.819" end="00:36:38.789" style="s2">I&#39;m constantly wanting to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.789" end="00:36:42.210" style="s2">people inspire them and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.789" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">know other things to keep them on their</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.210" end="00:36:45.569" style="s2">growth edge for the reason that you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:48.029" style="s2">say and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.569" end="00:36:50.069" style="s2">interesting line of where where</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.029" end="00:36:51.869" style="s2">someone&#39;s growth edge is versus where</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.069" end="00:36:55.650" style="s2">there&#39;s you know kind of gone past the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.869" end="00:36:59.309" style="s2">point of repair ability or if not that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.650" end="00:37:01.319" style="s2">is some damage that it&#39;s caused as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.309" end="00:37:05.009" style="s2">result of it and that&#39;s that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.319" end="00:37:06.660" style="s2">interesting point there and the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.009" end="00:37:10.920" style="s2">thing you said earlier about recovery</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.660" end="00:37:14.759" style="s2">because in in talking about resilience</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.920" end="00:37:16.470" style="s2">in pivot one of the anxiety ice it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.759" end="00:37:19.170" style="s2">three-part process and the third part is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.470" end="00:37:23.099" style="s2">on rituals for recovery so I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.170" end="00:37:24.930" style="s2">do you have rituals for recovery things</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.099" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">that you that you&#39;re doing constant you</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.930" end="00:37:28.619" style="s2">know continuously our regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">that&#39;s usually ensure that you would</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.619" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">cover yeah so we only mentioned a few</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:44.460" style="s2">types of rituals</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:47.309" style="s2">rituals so there&#39;s there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.460" end="00:37:50.910" style="s2">are just what I&#39;d call foundations so a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.309" end="00:37:52.710" style="s2">healthy diet healthy good hygiene and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.910" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">movement would all just be foundational</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.710" end="00:37:56.279" style="s2">and those are all physically their</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:58.589" style="s2">physiological sense right your</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.279" end="00:38:02.339" style="s2">physiologic foundations okay other</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.589" end="00:38:04.019" style="s2">things that I would say you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.339" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">doing regularly enough that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.019" end="00:38:10.769" style="s2">ritualized on top of that are things</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:14.819" style="s2">like cryotherapy hot cold therapy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.769" end="00:38:19.890" style="s2">particularly cold therapy as a method</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.819" end="00:38:21.930" style="s2">for increasing system resilience other</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.890" end="00:38:23.789" style="s2">kinds of therapies like PMF post</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.930" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">electromagnetic field therapy which has</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.789" end="00:38:29.819" style="s2">a number of really generously healing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:32.460" style="s2">physiologic dynamics increases the zeta</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.819" end="00:38:35.640" style="s2">potential the blood you know so things</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.460" end="00:38:38.609" style="s2">like that active physiologic restoration</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.640" end="00:38:39.180" style="s2">so you know beyond restoration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.609" end="00:38:42.359" style="s2">happening from</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.180" end="00:38:45.720" style="s2">while sleeping on just restoration well</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.359" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">awake recall meditation which is both in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.720" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">a psychological and physical object but</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:54.150" style="s2">and then I do a lot of physiologic</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:57.660" style="s2">therapies that increase the resilience</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.150" end="00:38:59.690" style="s2">of the system so that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.660" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">nutrients and kind of bio modulators</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.690" end="00:39:05.339" style="s2">supplements medicines as well as not</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.930" end="00:39:07.910" style="s2">just things that are orally but IV</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.339" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">trained therapies things like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.910" end="00:39:14.750" style="s2">because when you realize that you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">take more responsibility for how your</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.750" end="00:39:24.390" style="s2">you know physiology inches or not</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">processes to start to learn and as far</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.390" end="00:39:34.740" style="s2">as other rituals psychological stress so</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.970" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">you know meditation is valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.740" end="00:39:41.609" style="s2">being able to learn how to focus the</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.150" end="00:40:47.420" style="s2">and you know what it&#39;s I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.109" end="00:40:49.400" style="s2">that that those three parts to the so</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.420" end="00:40:51.890" style="s2">that so that resilience process</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.400" end="00:40:54.950" style="s2">the first one is reframing so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.890" end="00:40:57.589" style="s2">thinking or luge asleep taking a look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.950" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">a situation and the frame that you put</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.589" end="00:41:04.220" style="s2">it in I will determine whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:06.650" style="s2">stressed by it or not you&#39;ve made a poor</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.220" end="00:41:07.910" style="s2">decision and you believe that you made a</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.910" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">where you will always make poor</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.220" end="00:41:15.470" style="s2">decisions well that&#39;s one frame that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:17.990" style="s2">keep you stressed and entry yeah but be</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.470" end="00:41:19.339" style="s2">a lot that flow you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.990" end="00:41:21.109" style="s2">domino will tip over a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.339" end="00:41:25.579" style="s2">dominoes and then the second piece is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.109" end="00:41:27.859" style="s2">really how how would you apply one have</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.579" end="00:41:29.539" style="s2">you have you learned something from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.859" end="00:41:31.249" style="s2">experience that you can they&#39;re asked to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.539" end="00:41:34.039" style="s2">apply because I think that&#39;s a part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.249" end="00:41:36.980" style="s2">the natural can regenerative process is</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.039" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">that we learn from the feedback that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.980" end="00:41:42.680" style="s2">get that it&#39;s biofeedback right and any</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.329" style="s2">feedback really we know and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.680" end="00:41:46.869" style="s2">we that&#39;s our weave adapter that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.329" end="00:41:50.059" style="s2">the species is to memorize we just</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.869" end="00:41:52.910" style="s2">continue been able to assimilate</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.059" end="00:41:56.690" style="s2">information make adjustments from that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.910" end="00:42:00.680" style="s2">feedback and then adapt them and thrive</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.690" end="00:42:03.650" style="s2">and continue that you actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.680" end="00:42:07.099" style="s2">enumerated both of those as methods of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.650" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">framing which is kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.099" end="00:42:11.900" style="s2">behavioral therapy meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.609" style="s2">reframing and then also really focusing</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.900" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">on the lesson rather than the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.609" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">and the lesson moving forward as</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:22.279" style="s2">something that increases your adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:24.049" style="s2">capacity when you look at life through</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.279" end="00:42:25.430" style="s2">the lens of alright so what are all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.049" end="00:42:26.869" style="s2">things that happen today they&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.430" end="00:42:28.759" style="s2">things that felt wonderful and you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.869" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">grateful for those who you&#39;re focusing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.759" end="00:42:34.700" style="s2">on actually giving attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:35.450" style="s2">things that were wonderful and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.700" end="00:42:39.289" style="s2">there were things that were difficult</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.450" end="00:42:40.819" style="s2">and you say it is there anything that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.289" end="00:42:42.349" style="s2">could learn that would allow me to deal</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.819" end="00:42:43.759" style="s2">with situations like that better in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.349" end="00:42:46.130" style="s2">future so that rather than just being</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.759" end="00:42:48.230" style="s2">difficult and I try and let it go I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.130" end="00:42:50.569" style="s2">increase my system resilience in</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.230" end="00:42:52.220" style="s2">response to them and then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.569" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">insights and then focus on the insight</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.220" end="00:42:54.540" style="s2">rather than the differ</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:55.830" style="s2">the day is just filled with things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.540" end="00:42:58.620" style="s2">felt great and things made you more</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.830" end="00:43:02.990" style="s2">capable exactly and those are the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.620" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">that you focus on here I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.990" end="00:43:07.350" style="s2">question I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:08.940" style="s2">asked you in this interview but have you</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.350" end="00:43:11.940" style="s2">read the presents process Michael</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.940" end="00:43:14.130" style="s2">Vaughn&#39;s work interesting so everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.940" end="00:43:16.050" style="s2">that has not yet come and checked that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.130" end="00:43:18.360" style="s2">work out I recommend that it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.050" end="00:43:20.670" style="s2">pretty incredible and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.360" end="00:43:24.630" style="s2">that he writes about which has really</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.670" end="00:43:27.210" style="s2">been then it&#39;s it&#39;s been inside of me</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.630" end="00:43:29.670" style="s2">now for settlements like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.210" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">shake it because it&#39;s it&#39;s shaken up a</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.670" end="00:43:34.320" style="s2">lot of a lot of things in a really great</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:37.350" style="s2">way which is that he doesn&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.320" end="00:43:40.470" style="s2">healing and and often especially we talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.350" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">about emotional trauma imprints for more</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.470" end="00:43:44.310" style="s2">more young and and how it is that those</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:47.370" style="s2">those that imprint thing from one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.310" end="00:43:49.350" style="s2">very young actually determines how we</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.370" end="00:43:51.300" style="s2">frame the world let you say how would</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.350" end="00:43:53.700" style="s2">give meaning or meaning making machines</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.300" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">so where does that all start</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.700" end="00:43:59.250" style="s2">and so we trace it back to this this</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">imprisonment of person were young a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.250" end="00:44:03.480" style="s2">of people and a lot of people out there</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:06.210" style="s2">that are talking about and not talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.480" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">about then that are engaged and helping</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.210" end="00:44:10.140" style="s2">people heal I mean I&#39;m in a healing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.010" end="00:44:12.930" style="s2">industry in the healing arts of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.140" end="00:44:15.300" style="s2">and it&#39;s I&#39;m not against any form of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.930" end="00:44:17.220" style="s2">healing but he&#39;s talking about instead</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.300" end="00:44:19.980" style="s2">of using words feeling it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.220" end="00:44:22.110" style="s2">integrating and the stage of our therapy</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.980" end="00:44:23.880" style="s2">as opposed to healing for as though</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.110" end="00:44:26.220" style="s2">healing and the healing makes you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.880" end="00:44:27.780" style="s2">immediately what that for something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.220" end="00:44:30.000" style="s2">must be healed for something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.780" end="00:44:31.050" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s in the system that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.000" end="00:44:32.490" style="s2">belong in the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.050" end="00:44:35.070" style="s2">it was opposed to something that might</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:39.330" style="s2">just not see integrated into the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.070" end="00:44:43.890" style="s2">which is why it&#39;s it&#39;s the you know if</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.330" end="00:44:45.180" style="s2">it comes the cancer so you know it just</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.890" end="00:44:46.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just one of those things I look</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.180" end="00:44:50.430" style="s2">forward to maybe we chat about in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.860" end="00:44:51.990" style="s2">future love to get your opinion there so</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.430" end="00:44:55.500" style="s2">I&#39;d say in the in the just the remaining</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.990" end="00:44:58.470" style="s2">time this is a show about conscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.500" end="00:45:02.690" style="s2">pivoting so it&#39;s just wonderful to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.470" end="00:45:05.430" style="s2">able to speak I mean it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.690" end="00:45:06.809" style="s2">committed to what it is you know how</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.430" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of bill</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.809" end="00:45:11.549" style="s2">we made up in before before we talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:13.679" style="s2">about what your business is doing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.549" end="00:45:15.719" style="s2">assist in the world because I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.679" end="00:45:17.729" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something really profound</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.719" end="00:45:21.150" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I told you brother James</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.729" end="00:45:23.099" style="s2">I said I what you&#39;re doing makes more</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.150" end="00:45:25.609" style="s2">than makes sense to me it is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.099" end="00:45:28.049" style="s2">something I feel good about supporting</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.609" end="00:45:29.849" style="s2">and before we get to that I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.049" end="00:45:33.509" style="s2">just know if there&#39;s a if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.849" end="00:45:36.390" style="s2">pivot in your life that you&#39;ve had more</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.509" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">recently perhaps or you know some time</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.390" end="00:45:41.219" style="s2">ago if you wish either in your personal</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:44.339" style="s2">life in your business life you were able</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.219" end="00:45:50.609" style="s2">to glean some special lesson from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.339" end="00:45:53.009" style="s2">you&#39;d like to share you know the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.609" end="00:45:55.469" style="s2">one that came to mind that might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.009" end="00:45:57.869" style="s2">interesting for listeners here was there</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.469" end="00:46:02.669" style="s2">was a pivot to actually decide to engage</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.869" end="00:46:05.249" style="s2">in business at all my work previous to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.669" end="00:46:11.069" style="s2">that was all in either a nonprofit or</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.249" end="00:46:12.689" style="s2">academics and specifically a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.069" end="00:46:14.719" style="s2">nonprofit was think-tank work most I</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.689" end="00:46:16.529" style="s2">mean some of it was working in</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.719" end="00:46:18.089" style="s2">environmental work and social justice</p>

<p begin="00:50:05.029" end="00:50:12.260" style="s2">working in just you know kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.690" end="00:50:24.950" style="s2">their structures were just not well</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.420" end="00:50:27.500" style="s2">enough set up to do a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.950" end="00:50:29.630" style="s2">I wanted to do and that we&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.500" end="00:50:33.230" style="s2">have to be able to and take</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.630" end="00:50:35.539" style="s2">responsibility for prototyping the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.230" end="00:50:39.259" style="s2">things we wanted to prototype and so I</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.849" end="00:50:45.769" style="s2">businesses even though the eventual role</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.029" end="00:50:47.390" style="s2">is to transition the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.769" end="00:50:50.359" style="s2">structures of what we call a business in</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.390" end="00:50:53.559" style="s2">capitalist and so in order to do that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.359" end="00:50:56.779" style="s2">had to enough went to the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.559" end="00:50:58.940" style="s2">the idea of being an entrepreneur was</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.779" end="00:51:01.430" style="s2">the farthest thing from my identity</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.940" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">grated philosopher yes scientist yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.430" end="00:51:04.339" style="s2">activist yes entrepreneur all</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:06.410" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.339" end="00:51:08.569" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean not entrepreneurial in</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.410" end="00:51:10.220" style="s2">the outside of capitalism sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.569" end="00:51:13.789" style="s2">creative way but that was in vendor</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.220" end="00:51:15.079" style="s2">right as we thought in capitalism the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.789" end="00:51:16.730" style="s2">idea of marketer was like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.079" end="00:51:19.579" style="s2">thing ever right because I&#39;m like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.730" end="00:51:24.170" style="s2">marketing is with only seconds of being</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.579" end="00:51:25.400" style="s2">a salesperson and and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.170" end="00:51:27.410" style="s2">think about it from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.400" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">look at how much we put into marketing</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.410" end="00:51:33.250" style="s2">budgets rather than into product</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:33.250" style="s2">development to have me to products just</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.650" end="00:51:39.640" style="s2">not add more novel value to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.660" end="00:51:41.170" style="s2">lives is I&#39;ve always wanted to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.640" end="00:51:44.020" style="s2">of marketing as a whole that get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.170" end="00:51:45.640" style="s2">the entire space synthesize all of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.020" end="00:51:47.080" style="s2">product technology and then have people</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.640" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">have access to the best without a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.080" end="00:51:51.130" style="s2">marketing layer in between the missin</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:53.460" style="s2">forms what is actually good with</p>

<p begin="00:51:53.460" end="00:52:01.600" style="s2">and so having to say okay so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:04.540" style="s2">to burn or in a marketer and whatever to</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.600" end="00:52:05.980" style="s2">be able to actually develop the science</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.540" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">and technology that I want prototype</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.980" end="00:52:09.430" style="s2">wise even though it will eventually move</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:11.560" style="s2">into other systems that was not trivial</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.430" end="00:52:14.980" style="s2">for me it&#39;s not for you at all that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.560" end="00:52:18.100" style="s2">required saying even though this is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.980" end="00:52:22.150" style="s2">different than what my long-range goals</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.100" end="00:52:25.420" style="s2">are it is the best and service to it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.150" end="00:52:29.530" style="s2">I actually have to download a entirely</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.420" end="00:52:31.300" style="s2">new element of personality right because</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.530" end="00:52:33.430" style="s2">I can&#39;t continue to feel that conflicted</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.300" end="00:52:35.859" style="s2">with it no you feel like a sellout</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.430" end="00:52:38.680" style="s2">otherwise and so it was how do I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.859" end="00:52:41.140" style="s2">actually download the identity of</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.680" end="00:52:42.670" style="s2">entrepreneur of marketer it sees the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.140" end="00:52:44.380" style="s2">beauty rather than the dysfunction and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.670" end="00:52:45.670" style="s2">then and then it integrates with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.380" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">other parts that doesn&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.670" end="00:52:50.109" style="s2">dysfunctional part and uses it in an</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">adaptive way so that was actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.109" end="00:52:56.740" style="s2">interesting non-trivial pivot to say I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">actually want to take science tech</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.740" end="00:53:02.410" style="s2">philosophy strategy and move it into</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:05.400" style="s2">business because it&#39;s a vehicle that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.410" end="00:53:10.109" style="s2">the current landscape I can actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.400" end="00:53:10.109" style="s2">advance further faster meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.550" end="00:53:15.430" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:16.990" style="s2">and the key there was so interesting cuz</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.430" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">that was an identity level to it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.990" end="00:53:22.829" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t a strategy level pivot because</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.940" end="00:53:25.320" style="s2">it was have to add a module to identity</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.829" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">you learn into the phone booth like I</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.320" end="00:53:31.300" style="s2">you you you&#39;re like Clark Kent he walked</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:33.820" style="s2">in as Clark Kent but you can merge this</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.300" end="00:53:37.660" style="s2">in with a different identity same person</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.820" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">by the way but different identity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.660" end="00:53:42.970" style="s2">there has to be a shift in that phone</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:45.730" style="s2">booth fighters and that&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.970" end="00:53:49.630" style="s2">you know my value systems of what I seek</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.730" end="00:53:52.420" style="s2">to serve or deeper to me then what I</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.630" end="00:53:53.740" style="s2">have skillet or what I like because what</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.420" end="00:53:55.540" style="s2">I like would have been different had I</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.740" end="00:53:56.710" style="s2">grown up in a different culture what my</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.540" end="00:53:57.790" style="s2">skill sets are would have been different</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.710" end="00:53:59.410" style="s2">had they done a different college</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.790" end="00:54:02.050" style="s2">program whatever and that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.410" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">changeable but what I ultimately love</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.050" end="00:54:06.520" style="s2">the most and seek to serve the most is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">is deeper and less changing than those</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.520" end="00:54:10.359" style="s2">other things are some like oh if</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:12.280" style="s2">actually adding entrepreneur and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.359" end="00:54:13.450" style="s2">marketer allows me to serve the things</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.280" end="00:54:14.950" style="s2">that I care about more in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.450" end="00:54:18.190" style="s2">particular environment in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.950" end="00:54:19.720" style="s2">particular time period then it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.190" end="00:54:21.970" style="s2">actually in service to the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.720" end="00:54:24.869" style="s2">aspect of self which is the values to</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.970" end="00:54:27.940" style="s2">bring in new modules of identity</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.869" end="00:54:31.060" style="s2">beautiful so share a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.940" end="00:54:33.339" style="s2">the businesses they you put a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.060" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">into because I think that&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.770" end="00:55:33.060" style="s2">looking at this involves a few things it</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.490" end="00:55:35.500" style="s2">involves personalization it involves</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.060" end="00:55:37.900" style="s2">addressing multiple systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.500" end="00:55:40.359" style="s2">simultaneously it involves synthesis of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.900" end="00:55:43.510" style="s2">multiple different strategies and apply</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.359" end="00:55:45.609" style="s2">its energy you know those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.510" end="00:55:48.609" style="s2">things I can speak more about that in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.609" end="00:55:51.450" style="s2">minute but basically we saw that there</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.609" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">were major sources of human suffering</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.450" end="00:56:00.910" style="s2">physical pain anxiety depression etc</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:56:02.530" style="s2">that as well as chronic illness that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.910" end="00:56:05.460" style="s2">had an approach that we believed could</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.530" end="00:56:09.609" style="s2">do something really novel to address and</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.460" end="00:56:12.490" style="s2">our early testing showed that was true</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.609" end="00:56:14.530" style="s2">and that we were able to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.490" end="00:56:16.390" style="s2">major changes and things that hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.530" end="00:56:19.960" style="s2">believed hadn&#39;t been believed to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.390" end="00:56:22.420" style="s2">modifiable or correctable things but</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.960" end="00:56:23.950" style="s2">that beyond addressing human suffering</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.420" end="00:56:27.089" style="s2">and increasing individual and quality of</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.950" end="00:56:29.650" style="s2">life as we look at the major macro</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.089" end="00:56:32.800" style="s2">issues of the world whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.650" end="00:56:35.710" style="s2">talking about religious extremism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.800" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">female genital mutilation or violence</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.710" end="00:56:41.230" style="s2">towards children or overfishing of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">oceans or total biodiversity loss like</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.230" end="00:56:46.040" style="s2">all these issues our human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:49.970" style="s2">mediated</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.040" end="00:56:52.730" style="s2">and so changing them requires changing</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.970" end="00:56:54.350" style="s2">patterns of human behavior and as I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.730" end="00:56:55.790" style="s2">talking about earlier you know the focus</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.350" end="00:56:57.080" style="s2">of changing economics is because</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.790" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">economic stress patterns of human</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.080" end="00:56:59.960" style="s2">behavior you make a well worth a million</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.730" style="s2">dollars to add and nothing alive in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.960" end="00:57:03.740" style="s2">incentive system drives human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.730" end="00:57:06.770" style="s2">so you have to change macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.740" end="00:57:08.030" style="s2">incentives but you also so economics is</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.770" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">one thing that affects you my hair is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.030" end="00:57:13.220" style="s2">not the only thing right so all of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:15.500" style="s2">social systems that lead to incentive</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.220" end="00:57:17.690" style="s2">and status and you know the kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.500" end="00:57:19.430" style="s2">theory dynamics are certain things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.690" end="00:57:20.930" style="s2">we need to change environmental</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:22.670" style="s2">psychology and the way environments</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.930" end="00:57:24.920" style="s2">condition and pattern human behavior is</p>

<p begin="00:57:43.070" end="00:57:46.910" style="s2">major so it&#39;s physiology and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.860" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">of the things that we really started to</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.910" end="00:57:52.790" style="s2">look at was in order to address the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:54.650" style="s2">problems of the world at scale we have</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.790" end="00:57:56.560" style="s2">to have humans that are not predisposed</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.650" end="00:57:58.850" style="s2">to continue positive those problems</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.560" end="00:58:00.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a big deal I also have to have</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.850" end="00:58:05.710" style="s2">humans that are predisposed to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.800" end="00:58:08.270" style="s2">problems and to create beauty and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.710" end="00:58:11.720" style="s2">this means humans that are oriented</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.270" end="00:58:14.330" style="s2">towards more empathy more emotional</p>

<p begin="00:58:31.000" end="00:58:35.260" style="s2">you know empathy is mediated over</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.570" end="00:58:51.900" style="s2">we started looking at neuro chemical and</p>

<p begin="01:01:49.960" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">what we&#39;re working on doing here is how</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.430" end="01:01:57.010" style="s2">do we optimize human quality of life and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:58.000" style="s2">human capability to be a positive force</p>

<p begin="01:01:58.000" end="01:02:03.190" style="s2">else because realistically if we look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.060" end="01:02:05.580" style="s2">the balance sheet of nature right if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.190" end="01:02:08.770" style="s2">think about the Earth&#39;s balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.580" end="01:02:12.490" style="s2">most humans are on the liability side of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.770" end="01:02:15.310" style="s2">nature&#39;s balance sheet and the humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.490" end="01:02:17.050" style="s2">all have to move to the asset side which</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.310" end="01:02:18.460" style="s2">means if they are doing more net</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.050" end="01:02:20.110" style="s2">positive to the balance sheet of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.460" end="01:02:23.320" style="s2">Commons and they are net negative and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.110" end="01:02:25.290" style="s2">when I do we&#39;re not even in the realm of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.320" end="01:02:28.480" style="s2">that and we need to be very quickly and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.290" end="01:02:30.190" style="s2">so we want to increase the balance sheet</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.480" end="01:02:31.870" style="s2">of the psychological emotional balance</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.190" end="01:02:43.570" style="s2">sheet of the human and where they live</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.870" end="01:02:46.900" style="s2">on nature&#39;s balance sheet so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.570" end="01:02:48.760" style="s2">technology agnostic and at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.900" end="01:02:51.970" style="s2">you develop circuit products that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.760" end="01:02:54.070" style="s2">you&#39;re using to move that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.970" end="01:02:55.930" style="s2">tip those Domino&#39;s get them started</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.070" end="01:02:58.120" style="s2">right so just take a couple of minutes</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.930" end="01:02:59.650" style="s2">we could share you know this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.120" end="01:03:01.210" style="s2">not I know I know how you feel about</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.650" end="01:03:02.920" style="s2">this anyway so it&#39;s not marketing or</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.210" end="01:03:05.080" style="s2">sales but I love people who are curious</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.920" end="01:03:07.300" style="s2">to just know a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.080" end="01:03:09.340" style="s2">products that you&#39;ve got and then last</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.300" end="01:03:11.080" style="s2">thing I&#39;ll say is you know where can</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.340" end="01:03:13.660" style="s2">people find out more information that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.080" end="01:03:17.590" style="s2">way they can they never want to follow</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.660" end="01:03:21.700" style="s2">their curiosity they actually care so</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.590" end="01:03:23.740" style="s2">you know that company started just under</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.700" end="01:03:26.740" style="s2">three years ago we&#39;ve only moved into</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.740" end="01:03:29.950" style="s2">sharing products with people about six</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.740" end="01:03:32.380" style="s2">months ago we you know we&#39;re in testing</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.950" end="01:03:37.840" style="s2">with people over that entire time but in</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.380" end="01:03:39.700" style="s2">terms of actual marketing and so we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.840" end="01:03:48.520" style="s2">we didn&#39;t even shock when you said it</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.700" end="01:03:52.120" style="s2">it&#39;s good right but an end to the of</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.520" end="01:03:55.720" style="s2">course the essence of how we do</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.120" end="01:03:59.550" style="s2">marketing is education and if people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.720" end="01:03:59.550" style="s2">interested in lined great</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.220" end="01:04:05.829" style="s2">so we have one product that is currently</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.910" end="01:04:10.930" style="s2">for sale that&#39;s available to call qualia</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.829" end="01:04:12.430" style="s2">and we had a handful more that are in</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.930" end="01:04:14.200" style="s2">various phases of development that will</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.430" end="01:04:15.670" style="s2">be coming available soon and then a</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.200" end="01:04:19.480" style="s2">number of other ones that we&#39;re in just</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.670" end="01:04:21.369" style="s2">kind of early aren&#39;t Eon and why we</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.480" end="01:04:27.069" style="s2">started with quality a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.369" end="01:04:29.589" style="s2">one is taking pills is a much more</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.069" end="01:04:32.109" style="s2">familiar thing to people than hooking up</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.589" end="01:04:33.849" style="s2">transcranial devices to their head so</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.109" end="01:04:34.930" style="s2">there&#39;s much lower barrier of entry to</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.849" end="01:04:38.640" style="s2">something that you know there&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.930" end="01:04:41.380" style="s2">familiarity with it requires almost no</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">deep behavior modification so it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.380" end="01:04:45.849" style="s2">low barrier of injury from like a total</p>

<p begin="01:04:45.849" end="01:04:51.369" style="s2">to intermittent fasting or exercise or</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.369" end="01:04:58.240" style="s2">work and it can actually lead to</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.620" end="01:07:08.860" style="s2">increase dopamine specifically and you</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.650" end="01:07:21.550" style="s2">long term then you get down regulation</p>

<p begin="01:07:47.830" end="01:07:52.840" style="s2">going to increase drive it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.600" end="01:07:55.270" style="s2">to increase working memory it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.840" end="01:07:57.820" style="s2">gonna decrease some of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.270" end="01:08:00.940" style="s2">really matter and so you get a very</p>

<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:12.810" style="s2">down-regulation so our goal was could we</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.480" end="01:08:16.270" style="s2">produce a much more comprehensive set of</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.810" end="01:08:18.400" style="s2">real-time increases to the things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.270" end="01:08:20.170" style="s2">matter while having our long term</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.400" end="01:08:21.910" style="s2">effects be neutral to positive on those</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.170" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">same metrics and you know other metrics</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.910" end="01:08:26.350" style="s2">which would require a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:28.210" style="s2">different approach it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.350" end="01:08:29.890" style="s2">you know any kind of Pharma approach</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.210" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">just because the way the economics were</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.890" end="01:08:35.140" style="s2">structured where it has to be patentable</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:37.390" style="s2">to ever be able to make enough money to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.140" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">go through FDA approval so it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.390" end="01:08:42.930" style="s2">synthetic it has to be single molecule</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:46.660" style="s2">how could a synthetic single molecule</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.930" end="01:08:48.910" style="s2">ever comprehensively up regulate meaning</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.660" end="01:08:51.100" style="s2">synthetic meaning it&#39;s not part it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.910" end="01:08:53.109" style="s2">part of your normal endogenous chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.100" end="01:08:56.020" style="s2">and your normal chemistry involves so</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.109" end="01:08:57.550" style="s2">many simultaneous parallel and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.020" end="01:08:59.350" style="s2">sequential pathways how could that</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.550" end="01:09:01.450" style="s2">comprehensively abrogate just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.350" end="01:09:03.400" style="s2">right it&#39;s just structurally on a</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.450" end="01:09:07.030" style="s2">reasonable approach to that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.400" end="01:09:08.500" style="s2">thing so medicine for Western medicine</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.030" end="01:09:11.140" style="s2">is done a really good job with acute</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.500" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">illness and so if there&#39;s one cause of</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.140" end="01:09:15.190" style="s2">the issue that I can acute infection or</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:17.020" style="s2">an acute injury then it can deal with an</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.190" end="01:09:18.370" style="s2">acute solution to that single molecule</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.020" end="01:09:20.140" style="s2">can deal with that if it&#39;s a single</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.370" end="01:09:23.050" style="s2">pathway but if we&#39;re talking about lots</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.140" end="01:09:26.800" style="s2">of pathways then we needed a different</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.050" end="01:09:30.160" style="s2">way of approaching it and so when you</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.800" end="01:09:31.210" style="s2">look at when people are taking cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.160" end="01:09:34.990" style="s2">enhancers when you look at what they</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.210" end="01:09:37.090" style="s2">really want they want a kind of creative</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.990" end="01:09:39.340" style="s2">productive flow state where their</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.090" end="01:09:40.630" style="s2">cognitive capacities are engaged which</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.340" end="01:09:43.420" style="s2">is different than the flow state</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.630" end="01:09:45.250" style="s2">mathlete wants where their cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.420" end="01:09:46.930" style="s2">capacities being online their linguistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.250" end="01:09:50.290" style="s2">capacities aren&#39;t really relevant and in</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.930" end="01:09:52.480" style="s2">fact you know you here the flow genome</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.290" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">guy is talking about flow States where</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.480" end="01:09:56.770" style="s2">prefrontal cortexes shutting down and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:09:58.720" style="s2">people are in a very just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.770" end="01:10:02.980" style="s2">automated response that if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.720" end="01:10:04.510" style="s2">to write a book if you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.980" end="01:10:05.680" style="s2">science if you&#39;re trying to do a midterm</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.510" end="01:10:08.050" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to figure out how to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.680" end="01:10:09.850" style="s2">your tech startup you need a different</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.050" end="01:10:12.040" style="s2">kind of flow state than that right so</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.850" end="01:10:14.080" style="s2">what does it mean to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.040" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">flow a sense of height and creativity a</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.080" end="01:10:17.620" style="s2">sense of heightened productivity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:21.130" style="s2">actually have heightened productivity</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.620" end="01:10:23.310" style="s2">and where all of your cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.130" end="01:10:26.200" style="s2">abilities are online well it involves</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.310" end="01:10:28.810" style="s2">cognitive capacities like speed of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.200" end="01:10:31.750" style="s2">memory total working memory short-term</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.810" end="01:10:34.480" style="s2">long-term memory digit span verbal</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.750" end="01:10:37.960" style="s2">fluency right all those things intensity</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.480" end="01:10:39.170" style="s2">of concentration duration of focus task</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.960" end="01:10:40.730" style="s2">switching</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.170" end="01:10:41.900" style="s2">these are very opposite things which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.730" end="01:10:43.580" style="s2">why choosing hard to increase them</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.900" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">usually if I get intensity of focus I</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.580" end="01:10:46.940" style="s2">get pissed off if someone distracts me</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.530" style="s2">usually if I have task switching and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.940" end="01:10:49.969" style="s2">fluid intelligence I can&#39;t focus at</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.530" end="01:10:51.320" style="s2">heart amazing we actually want the</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.969" end="01:10:52.850" style="s2">ability to be deeply present with</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.320" end="01:10:54.199" style="s2">something and then be able to move if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.850" end="01:10:56.600" style="s2">need to be deeply pressed to come back</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.199" end="01:10:58.940" style="s2">right so how do we do all of those</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.600" end="01:11:01.100" style="s2">different functions simultaneously those</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.940" end="01:11:03.770" style="s2">are cognitive abilities while also</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.100" end="01:11:06.650" style="s2">having increased sense of purposefulness</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.770" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">meaningfulness Drive emotional</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.650" end="01:11:13.460" style="s2">resilience you know etc analysis</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:16.310" style="s2">critical thinking since the SIS creative</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.460" end="01:11:17.810" style="s2">thinking there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.310" end="01:11:19.400" style="s2">things so that we started by kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.810" end="01:11:20.600" style="s2">modeling the space of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.400" end="01:11:22.580" style="s2">actually seeking to affect from</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.600" end="01:11:24.350" style="s2">cognitive science marketing and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.580" end="01:11:26.420" style="s2">looking at what are all the physiologic</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.350" end="01:11:28.250" style="s2">pathways that are known about that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.420" end="01:11:30.890" style="s2">involved in mediating all of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.250" end="01:11:32.600" style="s2">functions then what chemistry&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.890" end="01:11:34.040" style="s2">support those pathways and then which of</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.600" end="01:11:36.260" style="s2">those chemistry&#39;s are generally well</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.040" end="01:11:38.540" style="s2">tolerated synergistic with each other</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.260" end="01:11:40.160" style="s2">have really good data on them and that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.540" end="01:11:42.199" style="s2">was the beginning of our hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.160" end="01:11:45.130" style="s2">process for generating a complex</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.199" end="01:11:47.090" style="s2">chemistry formula has lots of different</p>

<p begin="01:11:57.940" end="01:12:03.530" style="s2">and then we went into of course an</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.250" end="01:12:04.699" style="s2">iterative process where we were taking</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.530" end="01:12:05.989" style="s2">our and there&#39;s my office he&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="01:12:05.989" end="01:12:10.550" style="s2">and iterating until we got to a place</p>

<p begin="01:15:15.080" end="01:15:19.400" style="s2">exist right now reason why even as a</p>

<p begin="01:15:32.480" end="01:15:37.130" style="s2">a major gap between the best of what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:15:37.130" end="01:15:40.910" style="s2">to make if there&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
