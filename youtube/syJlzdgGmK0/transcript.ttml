<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">looking and I have a advent calendar in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">my room with chocolate it&#39;s I&#39;m saving</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">chocolate I feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.960" end="00:00:45.739" style="s2">around advent calendars I do not make</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">calendar for my child</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.739" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to have chocolate every</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:55.969" style="s2">day so I write our own up and so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">usually go to the dollar store and buy</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.969" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">different things that I can then put in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:04.439" style="s2">and so one would be coordinating that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">with other people so that maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.439" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">parent because I mean I love having</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">things more making more yeah so one</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">parent could make stuff for day one for</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">everyone day two for everyone and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">all homemade and adorable and better</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">than stuff in winning at the dollar</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">store so coordinating and thing is if</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">any of these ideas what I want to create</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">as a system or would anyone has an idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">like that you can put it out there and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">like instantly nearly instantly you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">twenty other parents who are like or 24</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:39.270" style="s2">I guess that would make sense right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:41.180" style="s2">24 parents you want to do that since</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.270" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">there&#39;s 24 days in an advent calendar</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.180" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">but you can make it out of a calendar</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">for absolutely anything any holiday get</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">other people that celebrate that holiday</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">with you and ideas for what could be in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">each one and if it oh but if I had that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">idea which have no had and I want to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">it out there that it&#39;s super easy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">offer an idea and have people either say</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">like that&#39;s the stupidest idea ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:03.600" style="s2">who wants to make an admin calendar full</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">of cute adorable crafts for your kid to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.600" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">do already haven&#39;t been made or which</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s more the case there</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:12.380" style="s2">might even be 90% of people who do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:13.940" style="s2">by the 10% like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.380" end="00:02:17.450" style="s2">I&#39;d love to do that and jump on board</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.940" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">with it but it&#39;s a more easier Avenue</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.450" end="00:02:20.870" style="s2">because I could do that I can put that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">on Facebook by itself but having a route</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.870" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">to be able to easily put your ideas out</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:33.470" style="s2">into the world have them tested along</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">the way and created together is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.470" end="00:02:37.970" style="s2">and I think it brings us much further in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">society and not just cause it creates</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.970" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">advent calendars because clearly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">a perk and not a necessity so 75 the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:51.290" style="s2">Apple is a little bit a plug for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:54.700" style="s2">system itself and a let&#39;s work together</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.290" end="00:02:54.700" style="s2">to create fun advent calendars</p>
