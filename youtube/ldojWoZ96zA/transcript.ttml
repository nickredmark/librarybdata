<p begin="00:01:20.320" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">affliction</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">apophenia finding fake patterns of evil</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">in events where none exist</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">fake patterns of evil</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:33.680" style="s2">in events where none exists so it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">this is an argument</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.680" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">for um a superstition</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">i agree there is something sort of uh in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">search of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">boogeymen of various kinds um</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">yeah yeah and i think you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">what when people talk about someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:52.399" style="s2">being a conspiracy theorist</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">that is um the the savvy version of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.399" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">i think is trying to get at like god</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">pattern we&#39;re not exist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">you&#39;re being a verificationist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">looking for a boogeyman etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">yep yep all right um wow we have a third</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">cat</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">where his milk is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:16.480" style="s2">um excuse me could male homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">emerge as an adaptive response in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.480" end="00:02:20.720" style="s2">populations with patrilineal transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">material resources</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.720" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">less male offspring with offspring</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">less male offspring with offspring means</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">less competition over inheritance which</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">maximum status for the eldest so fewer</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">male offspring with offspring means less</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">competition over inheritance which means</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">maximum status for eldest question mark</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">yep i am still hoping the world goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">back to normal and we can rent a hall</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">and we can have this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:47.599" style="s2">flat out but i will say um as a first</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">pass yes i think you&#39;re in the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.599" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">neighborhood the older brother right</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">hand rule</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">which says that the more older brothers</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">you have the more likely you are to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">gay</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">but only if you&#39;re right-handed actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">fits the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">pattern you&#39;re proposing here and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">will go more deeply into it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.240" style="s2">later with a proper haul rented</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.240" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">next question do you two think do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">two think</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">that things classified as mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">are adaptive mechanisms which might have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">been used for survival and reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">in the ancestral past but manifest</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">deleteriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">in the present environment depends which</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">yeah exactly so you know mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">is a bad category</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">some some of them are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">so-called mismatch diseases uh which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">our current environment is so out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">whack with</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">our ancestral environment um that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">not adapted appropriately to what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">going on now</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">um but some i mean there are also mental</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">illnesses that are entirely novel</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">uh and then there are others that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">called illness which</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">you know shouldn&#39;t shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">considered illness at all or just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">representative of the range of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">call it neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">uh that actually has existed</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">and should continue to exist now without</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">medicalized or drugged into submission</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">yep so i would i would agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">and i would say even the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">real disorders though are in general</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">malfunctions</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">of adaptive patterns so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">question about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">is the pattern itself of a pathology</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">and is the manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">also you know the manifestation will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">pathological in many cases but</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">if it&#39;s built of adaptive stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">know there&#39;s good stuff on this like</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">randy nessie&#39;s work on depression</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">which suggests it&#39;s an adaptation out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">all worth considering good</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">why are dolphins and whales seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">actually altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">such as swimming around humans in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:04:58.639" style="s2">presence of sharks is there an</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">evolutionary element</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.639" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">there&#39;s always an evolutionary element i</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">am simply going to make the phylogenetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">comment which otherwise you would make</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">and then i&#39;m going to let you</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">pick up the altruism question um which</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">is that dolphins are whales</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:15.520" style="s2">so saying dolphins and whales is is fine</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s like saying humans and monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">or humans and mammals</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">we it is true that we are a distinct</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">piece of that group</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">but just like dolphins um evolved from</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">whales and are therefore still part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">their original group</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">um so so it is true for us and primates</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">mammals and vertebrates and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">things but if you say whales</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">including dolphins then people like us</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">will know that you&#39;re in on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">phylogenetic reality of the thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">really matter that much for most</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">questions no it does it does because</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">if you if you just simply sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">the phylogenetic interpretation of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">and you say you know whales including</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">dolphins that&#39;s one level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">insight that you get just from simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">having understood that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">nested set but then you can say stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">dolphins including orcas right and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">point is each of these things tells you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">something really</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">cool about the evolution of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">creatures so anyway what was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">question though about altruism why do</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">are they do they seem to be altruistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">like when they swim around humans in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">presence of sharks are they</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">what&#39;s going on yeah well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">among the toothed whales which is i</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">think what you&#39;re talking about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">highly intelligent creatures who have</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">certainly noticed</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">that we humans seem to control a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">of um stuff surrounding their well-being</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">so it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">so let&#39;s just just as long as we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">phylogenetically you said tooth so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">basically you&#39;ve got veiling whales</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">whales is a good group</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">that evolves from um</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">hippos hippos i&#39;m trying to think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">group called i can&#39;t think of what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">including group in latin is called</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">anyway something cetacean oh uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:08.639" style="s2">said ardiodactyl said ardiodactyls yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.639" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">so um having gone back into the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve now got whales and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:16.080" style="s2">grouped into baleen and toothed whales</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">and the tooth whales are basically all</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.080" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">those things that we know of as dolphins</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">including orcas and then there&#39;s one one</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">big-bodied whale that&#39;s toothed</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">oh uh sperm whale sperm whale yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:27.840" style="s2">everything else is bailing well and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t tend to engage in this sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">of thing so you&#39;re probably pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">talking about tooth whales and maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:35.039" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">all toothed whales yeah first of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.039" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole group of tooth whales</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">that are um</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">bizarre and little known because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">pelagic</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">oh it&#39;s bigger than what i just said</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">then it includes more than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">i believe beaked whales is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:56.280" style="s2">subclade of toothed whales sperm whales</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">is a subclade of uh of toothed whales</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.280" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">dolphins um what else anything else in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">dolphins and porpoises i believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">inside of toothed whales in any case</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s a question about whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">altruism whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">reciprocal altruism in other words does</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">doing well by humans result in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:25.199" style="s2">benefit sometimes is it a misplaced</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">adaptation so for example when</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.199" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">people have been seen to be drowning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">dolphins have come to their rescue it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">possible that that is a dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">responding to a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">a fellow traveler in need</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">or it could be that it has a reflex</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">to um to take a d to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.959" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">preserve a drowning member of its pod by</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">putting them up to the surface and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s misdirected</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">um my guess is that dolphins are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">too smart for it to be an accident</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not confused about that not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">being a dolphin who&#39;s drowning if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">yeah i mean you know lots of reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">things that even a smart creature can</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">get involved in but this seems awfully</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">yeah so i don&#39;t know yeah probably not</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">altruism but um</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">uh collaborativism collaborativism</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">a kind of reciprocal altruism uh and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">yeah i mean dolphins are like us</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">extremely social and long-lived and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">have generational overlap and yes they</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:32.000" style="s2">live in extended family groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">and they you know they care for members</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.000" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">of their growth but</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">group both can and not and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">the idea of expanding that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">family of group</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">to to include someone not even up their</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">is something that you know frankly most</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">humans couldn&#39;t manage</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">it seems but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">maybe many dolphins can and actually i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s even fair what i just</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">said because</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">there are a lot of people who may not be</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">able to see the value in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">say preserving wild animals who still</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">love their</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">dog yep for instance i would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">that i am concerned though you gave a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">long list of similarities between us and</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">dolphins and you did not do</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">the work of the balancing list of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">oh no yes i did not i just go for it do</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">so i studied uh wales for a time in</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">college</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">i was in a marine mammals program and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">did learn that they are aquatic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">one major difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">they are very i didn&#39;t even know squeaky</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">and they have flippers well the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">squeakiness is probably on kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">the salt water</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">they probably just need more grease ah</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">nope because</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">freshwater dolphins are also squeaky</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">they are yes you&#39;ve heard this</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">or you&#39;ve just read in a book um i</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">prefer not to comment okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.000" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">all right we&#39;ve gotten silly because</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">been in front of a camera for too many</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">consecutive minutes that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">that&#39;s right okay um this question from</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">the discord server where once a week</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">people pose questions and they vote on</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">which question they&#39;d like us to answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">and this week the question they would</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">like us to answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">always big questions that we can&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">way it has in the past and why</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">modern feminism often doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">is actually based on the correct</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">one large exception</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">um you know the condom basically falls</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">falls to women and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">this is you know is it fair no is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">yes and is there any way around it it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be not yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">you know it would it would be great if</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">there was work on</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">um possible modes of contraception for</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">sure there&#39;s some but there&#39;s not nearly</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">as much</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s also physiologically harder to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:27.360" style="s2">get it to work which may be why there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.360" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">as much i think i believe that that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">yes um for reasons that are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">which maybe we&#39;ll come back to us</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.560" style="s2">yeah yeah maybe we will um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">hormonal birth control</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.920" end="00:12:45.440" style="s2">is not perfect you know when when the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">pill was first introduced it was at much</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.440" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">higher doses</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">than it has been for a long time um</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">i was certainly on you know very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">low-dose pill for many</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">many many many years and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">decided that basically i hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">an adult without having exogenous</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">that were working as contraception and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">that didn&#39;t strike me as a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">good idea much you know it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">certainly less worrisome to me than</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">allowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">children and um and teenagers to take</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">medical professionals but it is also</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">there is no reason to think that it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">totally harmless</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">even at very low doses that said</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">but could basically um not necessarily</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">the pill was first on the market that</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">could actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">help which is to say that in among</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">hunter-gatherers</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">most females girls and women experience</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">i&#39;m making up a number here and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">societies</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">but something less than 15 menses</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">like you know bleeding events menstrual</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">cycles</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">in their entire lifetime in their entire</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">and this is because it&#39;s not that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">are pregnant their entire lives</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.240" style="s2">but that the combination of being</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">pregnant during which you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.240" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">amenorrhea you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">menstruating and then when you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">breastfeeding</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">at least on demand and more and with</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">remember what it is every</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">six or eight hours or something you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">what&#39;s called lactation elementaria you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">don&#39;t um you don&#39;t menstruate</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">um due to the effectively the competing</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">hormones of producing milk</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">in which you know the adaptive reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">being if your body is producing milk for</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">an extent</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:56.320" style="s2">baby or toddler then it is not yet the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">time to get pregnant again because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.320" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">are still working to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">to feed a child um and the combination</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">of you missed one yep um so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">um lactational amenorrhea</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">there is gestation uh gestational and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">is starvation although i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">but you know a few uh female marathon</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">runners for example are often so lean</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">that they don&#39;t menstruate</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">so basically the body has all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">protections against getting pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">when having the resources to raise a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">is not evident and so anyway those</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">you&#39;re saying in principle could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">borrowed as a well specifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">it seems that so rarely in human history</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">until post-industrial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">have women had so many periods</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">uh that uh there is decent</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">reason to think and not enough research</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">uh that having so many periods actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">can cause long-term health effects like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">for instance anemia that that much loss</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">of blood over that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">you know that that reliably can cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">iron deficiency and so you know why not</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:14.959" style="s2">if you are taking a very low dose</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">hormonal contraception uh take it not 21</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.959" end="00:16:19.279" style="s2">out of 28 days</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">but 28 out of 28 days and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.279" end="00:16:23.680" style="s2">and don&#39;t maintain uh demonstration so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">you know originally the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.680" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">the dude who invented it imagined that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">menstruation was an absolutely necessary</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">um you know and there were all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">you know weird ideas around cleanliness</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">and dirtiness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">and women&#39;s reproductive um health not</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">um something that uh was being</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">been as it probably would be now</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">um but if you know if if the pill</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">instead allowed for say you know one</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">menstrual cycle in a year as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">13 of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">that would have only a slightly greater</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">hormones</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">but it might actually have a a positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">effect in the other direction of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">not having the women who are on them uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">whatever negative health effects there</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">are from having so many menses</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">and it would almost certainly preserve</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">fertility</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">uh for longer this is probably true</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">so anyway we can argue about the various</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">costs and benefits of that but</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">um but anyway that&#39;s probably probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">the case</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:35.039" style="s2">yeah but yeah i mean very very low level</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">um hormonal birth control</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.039" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">is not perfect there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">nothing that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">oh no lesbianism works like a charm</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">all right just thought i&#39;d mention it it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">is very effective</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">um so i&#39;ve heard it yes yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">yeah um i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:01.679" style="s2">yeah you know there&#39;s there&#39;s stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.679" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">um that some people really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">abide things like the copper iud which</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">is apparently extremely painful for some</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">people and the hormonal iud is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">recommended if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">are not um past your desire to have any</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">anymore or any children</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">um diaphragms are messy but effective</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s not a perfect solution</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">and the hormonal ones are by far</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">the most sat and forget and easiest</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">um but there are potential long-term</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">effects yep</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">all right so just a word on why it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">harder to generate</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">male birth control yeah if you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">males because they have two reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">strategies one of them does not involve</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">investment males are basically built</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">with a strong bias in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">fertilizing females irrespective</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">of the wisdom of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">because basically if a man is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">intending to stick around then</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">though the offspring he may produce is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:09.440" style="s2">very costly the cost doesn&#39;t fall to him</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">and therefore might as well sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.440" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">seeds falling from a tree might as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">germinate even if they land in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">bad soil because the alternative is</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">no no functional offspring so</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">anyway the idea is female bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">much more reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">to produce offspring because the cost is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">so damn high that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">they only want to produce offspring when</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">conditions are hospitable</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">and therefore it is easier to interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">that system because that system is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">looking out for all sorts of conditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">that say it&#39;s not a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">yeah so anyway that bias is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.520" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">not inflicted by the patriarchy um the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">patriarchy may find it convenient</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">but um nonetheless i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">actually the thing that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">a lot of what gets uh put on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">patriarchy&#39;s bill the patriarchy may</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">been using opportunistically but wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">actually its invention that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">mostly we in the patriarchy were just</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">very very</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">lucky we did not set this up we would</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">not have thought of it we would not have</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">had the dedication to make it work we</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">lucked into it and we&#39;re sorry</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.679" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">conclusively the loudly hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">the video is designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.880" style="s2">understandable to the layman as well so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">the general public will understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.880" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">so um i&#39;m excited to look at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">i can&#39;t promise i&#39;ll spend the whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">couple hours</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">unless it seems like you&#39;ve cracked the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">case in which case i will</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">all right good next question</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">how confident are you that generations</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">who are overly affected by social media</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">and in turn are much less</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">able to concentrate we&#39;ll still be able</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">to produce great doctors scientists</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">pilots etc</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">careers that require a special kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">wow i&#39;m not confident in the general</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">ability but i am confident that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">every generation has its misfits and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">that misfits</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">are um capable of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">weird stuff by virtue of the odd path</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">they&#39;ve traveled and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">there will be uh good doctors scientists</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">pilots etc what you don&#39;t want is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">system that&#39;s inhospitable to them</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">because they are um ill-mannered</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">uh yeah so with without without all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">social graces</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">right yeah prone to say awkward stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">um so anyway yes uh um</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">preserve your misfits</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">and they can carry you through tough</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">yeah and keep the children off social</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">media as long as as long as you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">and the pets keep the children off the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">pets</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">no the pets off the social media</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">i feel like if we had the pets on social</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">media and get the children off things</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">might be better</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">even more cat videos both senses of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">term maybe the cats would put up child</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">videos</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">that&#39;d be weird yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try this conducted</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">in-depth research regarding this</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">i wonder if there&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:53.120" style="s2">from this person hold on hold on let me</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">just say</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.120" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">okay um</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">oh no this is actually coming right</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">after the previous question i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.159" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">conducted in-depth research regarding</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">the situation i believe it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">what could possibly go wrong um yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">idea whether this is the plan it does</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">sound like the kind of thing that could</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.240" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">non-utopian um</p>

<p begin="00:24:05.840" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">weirdly comes out of catholicism and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:10.400" style="s2">have never delved far enough to find out</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.400" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">exactly that works but subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">that everything should be governed at</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">the lowest effective level</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">right so this idea that what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">global governance and top-down stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">is going to be a disaster because</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of stuff that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">want regulated at that level</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">on the other hand there&#39;s some stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">will need regulated that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:32.960" style="s2">somebody&#39;s got to protect the oceans and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.960" end="00:24:38.960" style="s2">and you know police certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">incursions and ultimately you&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.960" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">build things at that level too</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">so how do you do it well the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">figure out which is the lowest level</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">that you can effectively govern</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s the level that it should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">governed and then only those things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">have to be governed</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">globally get governed that way so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">i hope you&#39;re not right this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">somebody&#39;s plan</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">to replace nation states with something</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">higher up because</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">it will of course end in disaster</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">i need advice i&#39;m a crack addict but i</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">got a cushy no-show job because my dad</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">much danger of people spooking each</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">current madness</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">wondered what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">um some people who as adults um</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">really crave the dressing up and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">changing the personality</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">and the excuse to act in ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t normally</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">act you know that said i i say that at</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">and am truly intrigued by the liminality</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:05.520" style="s2">that is experienced by people at</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">carnevale</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.520" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">and you know the the the breakout</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">the american version</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">of it and i think it too often reveals</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">a deficit in people&#39;s lives but</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">third thing halloween this year is on</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">say the first hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">income tax to be a simple effective</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">nothing to corporations or free riders</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">at first pass that seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">potentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">decent approach well i&#39;m wondering if it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">if it isn&#39;t a tad regressive in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">may be very regressive</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">those who need it most are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">have paid least</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">those who would get the most well so up</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">i was going to say maybe up to you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">maybe that up to 100</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">000 is too high right like so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">uh up to 50 000 of income</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">and then if you know if you only made if</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">you made it at the poverty line or less</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.320" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">get double your refund or something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">this well wait a second that was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">in tax or a hundred thousand dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">income income</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">is it clear from the question yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">says 100 000 income</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">oh so it is clear from the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">in fact spelled out in english</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">in english well done um yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:57.279" style="s2">well still i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">inherently a bit regressive but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.279" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">to say that you couldn&#39;t fix it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">um yeah i think it&#39;s fixable um</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">and you know nothing to corporations or</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">free riders</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">uh yeah i think there&#39;s some i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">yeah uh so we had three</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">to no good would be my guess oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">no doubt chewing on bromeliads again i</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">okay greetings from phx is that phoenix</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s phoenix i&#39;m not sure um</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">you both married maintained your last</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">names and you had children together how</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">did you hash out whose last name your</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">kids would take</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">pro and con analysis to different</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">approaches question mark</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">yeah um so there&#39;s well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">there&#39;s at first thought there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">kind of three possibilities right like</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to keep our own names</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">um which we didn&#39;t we were just always</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">going to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">um at the point we have kids the kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">could have brett&#39;s name they could have</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">my name or we could hyphenate their</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">names</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">hyphenating names isn&#39;t sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.480" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">beyond one generation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:23.159" style="s2">um and you could combine names too i</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">guess which in our case would have</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.159" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">pre-produced the whinings which would</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">have been terrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">so um in part me</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">not taking your name brett uh was</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">the slightly unusual thing not at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">unusual in our sphere in our circle</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">uh and there was never i never imagined</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">you know at any point in my life that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">would end up taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">my husband&#39;s name because uh you know i</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">am i am</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.960" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">who i am um and love you dearly and hope</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">to be with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">forever but um i am not my identity</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">your identity despite what occasional</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">people who mail us may</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">think um with regard to you know mr and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.320" style="s2">mrs brett weinstein really</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">no you&#39;re not going to get any money</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.320" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">from me if you send me that piece of</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">um but because we happen to have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.399" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">patrilineal society which is different</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">from patriarchal and different from</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">patreon local petra lineal&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">anthropological term</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">which just identifies that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">that names and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">sometimes the other stuff like property</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">and and such go along with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">are tracked through the father&#39;s line as</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.320" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">opposed to the mother&#39;s line which we</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">matrilineal</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">in general um children so in general</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">women take their husbands names when</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">they marry and the children there</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">thereafter have the father&#39;s name as</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">well and that&#39;s a patrilineal society</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">having a rule in society that is either</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:54.640" style="s2">patrilineal or matrilineal makes good</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.640" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">and i don&#39;t find one um particularly</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">right um i didn&#39;t take urine simply</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:05.519" style="s2">i am who i am and i don&#39;t need to</p>

<p begin="00:33:05.519" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">um but having the children fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">model that is dominant in society</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">makes sense it&#39;s it adds clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">why would there be a rule of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">patrilinearity petrol lineality rather</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">it is that uh because in mammals and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">are mammals</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">uh certainty of paternity is never 100</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">whereas certainty of maternity is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:31.460" style="s2">what are you saying uh you know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.460" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">so even though you and i and our</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">children are all 100</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">confident that those children are your</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">children as they are my children</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">um society does cannot know that with</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">the same certainty</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">and so whereas i know for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">those are my children and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">plague me to have them walking around</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">with your last name</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.519" style="s2">you um being their father and having</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">them be</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.519" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">them have my last name inherently raises</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">questions in people&#39;s minds that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">just no reason to raise</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:04.840" style="s2">yep right so i don&#39;t we never we</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.399" style="s2">actually i don&#39;t think even ever had the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:07.360" style="s2">conversation i think we just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.360" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">all of that between us as evolutionary</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">are also trying to live in the world</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">generosity yeah no i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">if i can just encapsulate that please</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">were the kids to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">your last name and not mine it would</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">suggest</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">something about where those kids came</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">from that was in fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">not true so it would mislead um</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:38.720" style="s2">and so in any case this seemed like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">best of a bad set of choices because</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.720" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">truly none of the choices</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">are all that great from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">view of a world in which women do have</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">their own identities</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">and somebody either loses their identity</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:51.839" style="s2">or you main two</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.760" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">maintain two identities and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.839" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">know you hyphen hyphen hyphen or you</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">don&#39;t hyphen and you solve it for one</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">generation so</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no perfect solution yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.560" style="s2">like it you know it would be easier if</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">we all had the same last name as</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.560" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">as was true in both of the natal homes</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">from which we came</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">right um but</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">but you know we were born in a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:14.560" style="s2">era when that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">um understood to be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.560" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">needed to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit messier yep</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">um but uh this seems like</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">the least messy while getting the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">value from being able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">you know fully retain the identity of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">the adults going to the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">while um still allowing the um</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">names to reflect um reality with care</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">yep now of course there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">built in if the children have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">father&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">then it&#39;s more or less clear where the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">children came from but</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">the father does not have plausible</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:55.359" style="s2">deniability if the children turn out bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">i&#39;m just pointing it out yeah putting it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.359" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">out there you know something i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">no so far the kids have been great um</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">but you know you never know</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">you never know what sort of kids you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">got until</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">they&#39;ve grown old i guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">um so this uh thank you for taking the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">time to discuss dreer&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">uh book i&#39;m glad you have brought to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">your attention i hope your listeners</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">appreciate its content so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">person who</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">uh pointed out last last week thank you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">ethan thank you for pointing it out to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">us yes indeed um</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">next question could non-rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.960" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">coordination be a prerequisite for</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">societies to survive the technological</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">development necessary</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">for interstellar travel would this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">selection pressure mean any et species</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">we encounter is all but guaranteed to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a good one that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">question yeah it really is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">well i think you can think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">necessary unfortunately it would be cool</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">if it were</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">so here&#39;s the thing you got to remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">human beings cooperate to compete</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">we can now globalize that we can say any</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">species collaborates that is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">collaboration within the species not</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">that the whole species collaborates</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.880" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">any species in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:18.720" style="s2">collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:20.000" style="s2">will have that same explanation can you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.720" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">can you</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.000" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">can you sort of expand the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">to abiotic things like you&#39;re competing</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">against the you know darwin&#39;s hostile</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">forces that he never knew</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">which is how do you get super liberal</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">travel</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">um i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see that in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">question i think no i just um</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">to your point if we cooperate to compete</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">as humans in general what we mean when</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">we say that is that we are cooperating</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">with others like us to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">others like</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">us uh could you could we expand</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">could that metaphorically be extended to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">we are going to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">to compete against this problem of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">you know this abiotic problem of how do</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">we how are we going to travel beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">speed of light for instance</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">right well i think the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">is that compete</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">involves two kinds of competition so</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">there&#39;s the obvious kind of competition</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">which would be called interference</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">which involves disrupting your</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">antagonist&#39;s ability to do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">and then there&#39;s exploitation</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">competition in which you just simply use</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">a resource</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">and therefore there is less of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">available to your competitors</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">and in the case of abiotic forces</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">basically the point is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">you can be perfectly peaceful and expand</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">to fill some</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">niche and you&#39;re still competing right</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">and so i think what i see in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">is um you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">you there&#39;s certain things you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">want to bring on the spacecraft</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">like your instinct to get into a bar</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.839" end="00:39:01.599" style="s2">fight right</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">and so if bar fight is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.599" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">you know the height of poor judgment</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">worth whileness of um fighting</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">right you would want to back that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">instinct way off</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">for anybody who&#39;s going to be on a ship</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">with you for a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">and so barring hibernation</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">should we expect extraterrestrials when</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">they get off the ship to be very</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">collaborative and then should we expect</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">them to come from very collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">i can sort of see it but i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a requirement for the same reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">you point out a we would expect any</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">creature that had attained that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">to have been a ferociously good</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">competitor that&#39;s how you get those</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">capacities</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">and so i guess i would expect very</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">very competitively competent critters</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">that are very good at uh keeping a lid</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">right um so no bar fights i would not</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t expect when the aliens do in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">fact land</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">on the planet to find evidence of bar</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">fights in their spaceship</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">is my position yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">i am learning physics</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">do you know what dude can you it</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">probably says in</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">i&#39;m just gonna i&#39;m learning physics in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">perhaps perth washington</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">with a class called integrating</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">indigenous science and stem</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">like brett mentally i must resist their</p>

<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">acknowledgments of country etc how can i</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">fight back safely</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">please give me eat a reference to catch</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">22 which i read from a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">podcasts ago the ways you can fight back</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">innumerable the way safely they&#39;ll fight</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">back safely</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">are probably an empty set at this point</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">that&#39;s well i know i told you you got to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">be safe i mean it&#39;s not it&#39;s nice no and</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s so much more in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">book that we just spent a long time</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:14.560" style="s2">talking from um let&#39;s live not by lies</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.560" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t always need to be taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">aggressive action against the idiocy</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">that is coming your way but</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">um there is no end of resistance that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">right and um almost none of it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">totally safe</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">i would say the safest approach</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">is uh humor</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">and charm and that is unlikely to work</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">on your woke detractors</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">who are humorless and insensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">charm</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">as a trout</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:55.280" style="s2">but uh but you could practice by trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">to charm trout</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.280" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">trout yes and if you can charm trout you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">might be able to charm</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">the woke teacher in front of the room</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">actually am i right</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">no that no i think i might be okay that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">uh fly fishermen effectively</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">charm trout they totally do so charm</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">woke teacher with a hook</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">no wait it&#39;s fly fisherman not right</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">um but yeah i think the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">what the thing that you can do that will</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">protect you best</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">is to cause yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:32.079" style="s2">well liked amongst those who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">committed to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.079" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">particular revolution will that make you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:37.599" style="s2">safe no no but make it look like fun to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.760" style="s2">be where you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">yeah make it look like a good choice</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.760" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">right don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">especially given that the the webster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">seem so intent on being dour and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">humorless</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">and musicless and um just filled of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">filled with outrage and hatred um try</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">filling your life with other things</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">and and making it visible right like</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">laughing</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">and smiling and i mean even just that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">the the amount of distance that a smile</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.000" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">at someone you don&#39;t know can go</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">is is huge and even you know even now</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">and covered times with</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:13.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re doing this by</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">zoom but if you&#39;re in the same room and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.359" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">masked a smile with your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">is actually revealing of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">actual tenderness that um</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">that most people respond to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:31.760" style="s2">could science ever be compromised to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">degree that would be required to debunk</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:36.079" style="s2">evolution should it interfere with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:38.319" style="s2">wider global agenda</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.079" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">boy i mean we&#39;re seeing this right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.319" end="00:43:41.440" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">you know can it continue to go that way</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.440" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">i think the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">the one saving grace here is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">whatever it is that doesn&#39;t allow its</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">science to be corrupted will immediately</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">start out competing whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">allows its science to be corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">yeah and therefore um the fools can do</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">whatever they want</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">arguing that uh you know sex is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">a construct and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s all tools of the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">right but</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">i mean i mean already the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">biologists</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">are distrusted and maligned</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">um by many in the social sciences i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:20.240" style="s2">someone saw</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">that i&#39;m an evolutionary biologist in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.240" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">twitter bio and told me i must be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">social darwinist</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">which is insane like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">eugenicist</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">right like no those aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">thing that&#39;s a bastardization</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">of evolutionary thinking that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">evolutionary thinking gets you</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">but uh this people aren&#39;t educated at</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">this point enough to know so</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">could it get worse yeah it can get worse</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">yeah on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">darwinism has made itself vulnerable um</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">it needs to get better and fast so</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">let that be a warning to you okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">three more here and we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">some of these next time and then go</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">to this hour&#39;s questions what are your</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">thoughts on totalitarian government</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">control and the ensuing division it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">causing as it relates to covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">especially in the face of inclusive and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">uncertain scientific findings</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">is the question how are totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">regimes doing relativity no i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">and i apologize if i&#39;m misreading the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">question but i think that the question</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">posits without claiming that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">positing uh that things like lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:28.480" style="s2">and mandatory mass requirements is</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">itself totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.480" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">yeah i think this is this is a tough one</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">because in effect we are now dealing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">with technological realities like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">airplanes that make epidemics</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">and the possibility of generating</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">endemic</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">uh pathogens that follow us around and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">these things are now very serious</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">realities with major human consequences</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">the fact that we may have to be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">totalitarian to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">deal with pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">is not to me a sign of something having</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">gone wrong it&#39;s a sign</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">of our novel uh world</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">requiring us to suspend certain</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:14.560" style="s2">with respect to things like uh pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.560" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">i would just say i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">totalitarian authoritarian a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">but i think totalitarianism is a step</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">beyond and that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">a a value judgment that is is not right</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">i i that&#39;s kind of what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">effectively you know is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">are the laws that presumably surround</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">the um uh hand</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">washing and other uh protections</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:47.839" style="s2">in an operating theater is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.839" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think it is totalitarian i</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">think it&#39;s just smart</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">yeah um are pilots being required to to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:47:00.000" style="s2">check in with uh with air qual</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">who&#39;s in the tower what are they called</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.000" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">air traffic control air traffic control</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.520" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">is that you know is that authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">no that&#39;s that&#39;s regulation upon which</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">we all depend if we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">flying or</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">or um going into the knife yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">anyway those protections are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">that said the novelty of this situation</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">kovid does open the door</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">to governments taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">fears both uh real and unjustified</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">in order to do other things and so at</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:32.800" style="s2">some level we&#39;ve got to get control over</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">our governments</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.800" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">so that they don&#39;t abuse these powers so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">that when they actually have to utilize</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">these powers we can trust that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">doing it for the right reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">yeah um i guess i would just add quickly</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">uh our</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">i i told you i was in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:47.599" style="s2">one of our good friends from grad school</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">who i won&#39;t name here because i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.599" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">ask her in advance if i could but um</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">she&#39;s been living in sweden for many</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">years with her partner and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">they&#39;re probably going to stay there um</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">and well a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">quite apart from this question she is</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">actually reading hannah arense on</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">right now and and seeing some scary</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">things in it um but she also i asked her</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">you know what what what has it been like</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">there and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">it looks it it seemed like sweden was</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">doing something strange and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.040" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">not appropriately responsive early on</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">death rate was lower for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">then maybe it&#39;s getting worse again</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and she said you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">um actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">people here really trust and respect the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">and our death rate continues to not</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">um not be as high as almost anyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">outside of sweden was expecting</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">and the thing that really surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">was she said</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">there are no mask mandates and most</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">people are not wearing them</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">and my sense my friend says is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">this is because the government it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">deemed necessary yet but the government</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">has the sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">that if they make it a mandate everyone</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">will comply</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">because the government is trusted and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">there&#39;s this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">of we don&#39;t we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">apply these rules haphazardly or</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">casually such that when we do apply</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">rules</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">when we do make new rules we know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">we will have compliance</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">because the people know that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">take them lightly interesting this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">this struck me is very interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t really followed up</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">yet but super interesting um i just want</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">to note that i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">i&#39;m hearing mice in our walls yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s no cats back there at</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">this point and i think we have mice</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">fair enough yeah would you mind telling</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">me about how cellular memory works</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.720" style="s2">please</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">is an akashic record possible or</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.720" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">immeasurable</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know what the second part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">that question means at all do you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">what the first part means or is this</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">immunological</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:00.559" style="s2">memory i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">out there called cellular memory</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.559" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing i&#39;ve exactly i&#39;ve not heard</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">it in those</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">terms all right so i&#39;m going to assume</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">that what you mean is immunological</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">memory cells and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">is when you get sick</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">you have let&#39;s go before you get sick</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:27.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve got when you are in utero</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">oh that&#39;s really well before you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.280" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">sick well before you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">even difficult to get sick at that point</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">you have a diversity of cells in your</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">immune system that are predisposed to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">react to different</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">configurations of electromagnetic charge</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">on the surface of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">you have effectively every possible</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">combination at some</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">low level of resolution and then those</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">cells that have these capacities that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">react to your own tissues</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">disappear from the set they kill</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">themselves off and leave no descendants</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">so what you have is a system</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">that is prone to react to anything that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">enter your body that doesn&#39;t match your</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">own formulas right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:12.800" style="s2">now you get sick and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">the um pathogen has a unique signature</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.800" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you and so it triggers</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">some subset of these cells a very tiny</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">subset</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">that subset then goes through a process</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">of clonal selection</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">where it produces</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">offspring cells that have not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.520" style="s2">the same formula so it produces a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">diversity of offspring cells</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.520" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">that subset that is most reactive then</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">produces another generation and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">over time it discovers the formula to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">nail that pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">at the point that you&#39;ve destroyed the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">pathogen you get the triggering of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">production of memory cells which are</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">a subset of cells that remembers the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">precise formula</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">necessary to counteract that pathogen</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">and then those things can last now i</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is that causes</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">some of these memory cells to last</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:00.400" style="s2">different periods of time in other words</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">some kinds of immunities you have for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">period of time and then you need</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">to be revaccinated it could be that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:11.680" style="s2">is because the pathogen is changing at</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">some rate and so your memory cells just</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.680" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">aren&#39;t up to date</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:17.119" style="s2">i need a firmware update essentially of</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:19.119" style="s2">course you did</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.119" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">yeah of course i did but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.119" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">it is a process called clonal selection</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">in which evolution inside your immune</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:28.160" style="s2">hones in on the formula and then having</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">found the formula</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">a subset of cells that are long lived</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">is retained after that army that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">built up to fight the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:41.760" style="s2">the infection is gone excellent</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">okay one more question from here and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.760" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">then we&#39;ll switch to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">this hour&#39;s questions you said that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">bernie and yang were asking the right</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">but you weren&#39;t sure about their</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">solutions what do you think is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">solution for wage stagnation</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">well i think we have to rethink our</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">entire approach</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">to uh to training and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">work for a world in which uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">automating jobs out of existence and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">leaving people with</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">you know a massive service industry that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t justify the kinds of salaries</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.160" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">that would allow them</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">to raise children um so anyway i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">you can band-aid stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:21.839" style="s2">uh i think there are arguments to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">made for things like ubi</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.839" end="00:53:26.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve argued before that something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">participation income might be better</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.839" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">um because it lacks the perverse</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">implied in ubi um but i mean let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">face it we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">obvious crisis on our hands we have huge</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">numbers of homeless people who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">find anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">useful to do now some people were</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">homeless</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">10 years ago so maybe there are people</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">who just couldn&#39;t have done anything but</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">the fact that we have an increase in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">number of homeless</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">people obviously means that people who</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">were finding something useful to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t finding it now so</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to build a system that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">actually protects against that ebb and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:09.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t engage in</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">processes that address this to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.839" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">but uh you know this is why i say i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">radical as i actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">that the flaws are so deep that they</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">need a very substantial rewrite in spite</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">of the risk of unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">we need to do it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">but it needs to be done nice okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">starting at the top with this hour&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">while at the playground with my</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">two-year-old we noticed the swings are</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">no longer tied together</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">her response was that means the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">coronavirus went away</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">should i report her for spreading false</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">information yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">absolutely uh-huh yeah what are your</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">stats for the very least</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">oh yeah yeah yeah okay next question</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">is there some biological truth to</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">astrological personality traits</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">can factors like amount of sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">exposure in the womb and mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">seasonal diet influence development of</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">the birth period this is a terrific</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">and we actually speak a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">in one of the chapters of our book if</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">and this is a huge if you control for</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">you were born and not just when</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">then yes you absolutely should predict</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">and in fact there are some extremely</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">large scale studies that show</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">that uh birth month when you control for</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">birthplace</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">are uh predictive of being susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">to for instance certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">diseases</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">absolutely as you would expect but the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">astrology is doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t in any way</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">control for where</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">and could not possibly be predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">if uh if you know if being born on june</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">17th</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:56:00.640" style="s2">in uh imagine there is a perth</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">washington in perth washington versus</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.640" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">perth australia</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">totally different experiences you would</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">expect in fact the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">um i actually don&#39;t know exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">perth is in australia but</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">um doesn&#39;t matter still the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">in terms of seasonality but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">how seasonal it is there</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">right right so um but you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">something like the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">um in terms of what diseases are more</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">likely depending on what month you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">born in</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">yep uh so um i will just say</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that these things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">astrology can&#39;t have any general utility</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.440" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">because to the extent that your annual</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">cycle of seasonality</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">um is particular to where you are and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">that that might have implications</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">to the extent that you have astrology</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">absent</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">birthplace information right but</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">astrology effectively never has</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">birthplace information so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:57.200" style="s2">no that&#39;s not actually true right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:59.200" style="s2">like you know the pop the pop</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.200" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">astrology that everyone is familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">has none of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t know about originally but</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">that but there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">uh when they you know want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">read your signs whatever i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">the language of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:15.359" style="s2">um but will not do so without taking</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:17.839" style="s2">down information</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.359" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">about um where it was that you were born</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.839" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">as well and they and they and they build</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">their understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">what you will be like based on that now</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">i think then they will tend to build a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">whole lot of additional things that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">can&#39;t they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">possibly be known or predicted from</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">um time and place yeah of birth um</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:39.359" style="s2">but you know the the the pop the pop</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">astrology is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.359" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">clearly without any merit but once you</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">include the other thing which</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">apparently non-pop uh astrology often</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:52.400" style="s2">there is the potential for some for some</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">predictive power</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.400" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">on some on some fronts like disease risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">and even maybe some personality stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:01.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not buying that astrologers do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:04.480" style="s2">i am</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.359" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">i agree with you of course that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">that a an intersection between the time</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">of your birth and the place of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">birth means that you sit somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">in the seasonality of your weather</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">of the harvest of all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">and that that could have predictability</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">your mother could be outside with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">right right all sorts of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:24.079" style="s2">could manifest in personality in</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">particular ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.079" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">um i i&#39;ll be very surprised if there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">an astrological tradition</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:33.839" style="s2">that is global in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">soliciting information about where it</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.839" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">was that you were born</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">and when and it would also need to know</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">how long you remained there</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">since we don&#39;t remain in the same place</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">for life in order to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">effects were there would have to be some</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">sort of a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">basis for understanding that a person</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">born in mid-winter</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">you know is going to have these</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">personality traits well it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">to be theoretical it could be strictly</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:56.960" style="s2">empirical</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">well but the problem is in order for an</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.960" end="00:59:00.720" style="s2">astrologer to do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">they would have to get this information</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.720" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">and then extrapolate in other words oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">you were</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:07.000" style="s2">born in you know in los angeles in april</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.000" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">1969 but you immediately moved to</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:14.799" style="s2">new guinea right that would have been an</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">interesting different</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.799" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">life trajectory for me yes it would have</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">been a very different but the point</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">is you would need to make that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">correction and therefore you would need</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:24.319" style="s2">to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">model in which the point was okay yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.559" style="s2">born at time and place has implication</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">that implication decays based on how</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.559" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:36.160" style="s2">you moved on from there phrases i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.160" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">raise some interesting questions around</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">like how long will it matter i would</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">think it would matter only for maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">first year of life</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:47.520" style="s2">right like you mean that the pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">effect the actual effect</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.520" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">of being born a particular time in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">particular place</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">thus allowing accurate prediction</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">accurate astrological prediction that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">includes the all-important place</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">information and not just the the date of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.760" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">birth</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.440" style="s2">but the but the but the place of birth</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">information as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.440" end="01:00:07.359" style="s2">um by the time you&#39;re you know two i</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:08.480" style="s2">think it&#39;s certainly by the time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">three or four</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.480" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">um the seasonality isn&#39;t going to matter</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s really it&#39;s the very early stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;re born effectively still</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">still we still should be in the womb but</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:21.599" style="s2">pelvises can&#39;t accommodate giving birth</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">to babies that are any bigger than they</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.599" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">are and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">those first six months of life are</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">effectively still</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:30.319" style="s2">um you know like unborn babies and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s winter and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">you&#39;re spending time inside and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">therefore more susceptible to getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">say colds and flus</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">uh as opposed to its summer and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">more likely to be outside and getting</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">more exposure to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">sunlight and vitamin d uh is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">really important i would think for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:48.000" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">six months year maybe and i would think</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.000" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">after a year it shouldn&#39;t it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">matter if i had in fact moved to new</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">guinea</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">in april of 1970 a year after i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">born from los angeles i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">would have had</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">any effect on a a savvy astrologer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">ability to predict</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:09.119" style="s2">my uh personality well</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">no i would say it goes on longer than</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.119" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">that okay potentially</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">um and that basically if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">massive revolution that is constantly</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">going on in young children like</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:26.079" style="s2">you know up to the age of five</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">that a pattern of cyclicity that starts</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.079" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">at a particular place</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:34.240" style="s2">is going to have uh okay different</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.839" style="s2">impacts based on you know your first</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.240" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">summer and your second summer and all of</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.839" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">yeah um in any case it is also possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:44.400" style="s2">that part of what</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">astrology is is a misapplication</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">of local traditions that once were tuned</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:51.119" style="s2">into something</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.640" style="s2">right yeah so that you know that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.119" end="01:01:53.200" style="s2">were very convinced that it was real</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.640" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.200" end="01:01:56.799" style="s2">you know people you know astrologers</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">whatever they were were tracking</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.799" end="01:02:00.559" style="s2">local phenomena that were real and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">the point is oh this works</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.559" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">right for some reason where the stars</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:04.960" style="s2">are which tells you when in the year you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.960" end="01:02:08.720" style="s2">and you already know where you are</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">because that was implied in the fact</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.720" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">that people weren&#39;t moving very far</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:12.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">um so anyway all of those things are</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.319" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">possible um that said i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:19.359" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:19.760" style="s2">no reason to think modern astrology that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.359" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:26.000" style="s2">either global or going to be arbitrarily</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:27.680" style="s2">local is tracking anything well i have</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">anecdotes that suggest otherwise but we</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.680" end="01:02:32.559" style="s2">won&#39;t go into those here</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">okay yeah so apparently wa stands for</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.559" end="01:02:38.559" style="s2">western australia oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">okay of course it does sorry</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:44.720" style="s2">okay so that was perth</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">western australia not perth washington</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.720" end="01:02:48.079" style="s2">struck us as odd that we&#39;d never heard</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">of perth washington but we ran with it</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.079" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">yep okay we have to answer at least a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">few more of these we&#39;ve only gotten</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:57.520" style="s2">uh two so far this hour so um</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">do you have thoughts on pelosi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.520" end="01:03:01.280" style="s2">daughter and the twitter sphere accusing</p>

<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:11.680" style="s2">interest it&#39;s just that there are so</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.720" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">so many things to read yeah so i will</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.599" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">say the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">diagram on the cover of maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">comes very close to a diagram that i</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">made when i was working on frontiers and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">um basically game theory really so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">always wondered whether that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:35.520" style="s2">we were</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">onto related topics yeah although your</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.520" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">stuff on frontiers and game theory uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">would have come later maps of meetings</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:41.839" style="s2">from the 90s</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter yeah i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.839" end="01:04:45.520" style="s2">anything about it yeah and so anyway my</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:47.680" style="s2">stuff on frontiers</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.520" end="01:04:50.160" style="s2">involves a diagram that looks like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.680" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.160" end="01:04:53.520" style="s2">is some topic in that book i mean a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.520" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">cover art is just abstract but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">is the topic that he&#39;s on that results</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">in that diagram</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">in some way related to the frontier</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:10.400" style="s2">analogous or is it just happenstance</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">no and i think i mean i&#39;m i i would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.400" end="01:05:16.240" style="s2">i&#39;m flattered and i think it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:18.480" style="s2">that um that we have um</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.240" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">we have in many ways very simpatico</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.480" end="01:05:20.720" style="s2">understandings of the world in many</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">regards</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.720" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">uh to to jordan&#39;s yep uh and uh also</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:29.280" style="s2">when is your book coming</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:32.799" style="s2">um it seems that uh printers</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.280" end="01:05:33.440" style="s2">are um having lag times due to covet as</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.799" end="01:05:35.440" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.440" end="01:05:36.880" style="s2">and so it looks at this point like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.440" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">going to be somewhat later than it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.880" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:41.520" style="s2">more like the very end of summer next</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:44.480" style="s2">year very beginning of fall</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.520" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">which is uh disappointing but um</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.480" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">hopefully the world still</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">exists then and um this is the publisher</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">is hoping to do a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">a big enough print run uh that they have</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">to be thinking about actually being able</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">get enough copies printed that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">very strange honestly</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:05.440" style="s2">um jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">next question posited that gender</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">identity confusions may be a downstream</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">effect of proper</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.640" end="01:06:20.079" style="s2">love you too um that&#39;s interesting i</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t heard that exactly but um</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">deficits of play in childhood</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">will have a huge number of effects as</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:34.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:36.480" style="s2">and might some of those be um</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.480" end="01:06:38.000" style="s2">gender identity confusion you know just</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.480" end="01:06:41.039" style="s2">even not being allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.000" end="01:06:42.559" style="s2">play without adults overseeing you with</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.039" end="01:06:45.039" style="s2">members of both the same and opposite</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.559" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">sex and doing a little exploration</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.039" end="01:06:49.760" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely clearly um</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">so i would go back to my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.760" end="01:06:52.880" style="s2">aphorism good judgment comes from</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.880" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">experience comes from bad judgment right</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">so play is a landscape</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">of relative safety low stakes bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.119" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">yes low stakes bad judgment where you</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">try stuff out that sounds pretty right</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">and find out why it isn&#39;t and uh to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">extent that your play</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">has been moved onto a screen where</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:18.559" style="s2">some corporation has generated a</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">compelling visual landscape that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.559" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">nothing to do with reality and</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">only loosely involves other people and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:26.559" style="s2">so you&#39;ve stopped</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">skinning your knee and your forebrain</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.559" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">and all the other things that you might</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">um go outside skin your forebrain skin</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:34.960" style="s2">your forebrain get it get it over with</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:38.240" style="s2">now while i can still recover</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.960" end="01:07:39.839" style="s2">so yes almost no doubt that um</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.240" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">a lot of this stuff where people are</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.839" end="01:07:43.520" style="s2">saying patently ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">things that they haven&#39;t apparently</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.520" end="01:07:47.760" style="s2">discovered are false uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:48.720" style="s2">would have been cured by a proper play</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.760" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">environment where</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.720" end="01:07:53.599" style="s2">yeah we perhaps didn&#39;t interrupt</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:55.280" style="s2">them while they were skateboarding</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.599" end="01:07:59.039" style="s2">without safety equipment</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:08:00.160" style="s2">yes um hi guys do you think the right</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.039" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">the ra</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.160" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">do you think the rise of mercenary</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:05.359" style="s2">armies like blackwater</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:09.359" style="s2">could be the result of living in an</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.359" end="01:08:09.359" style="s2">increasingly post-national world</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">uh yeah a globally capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.039" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">world in which such things nothing can</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:17.839" style="s2">be bought</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.719" end="01:08:19.839" style="s2">anything can be bought i mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.839" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">also a lot of other stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">you know nations trying to evade their</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:27.520" style="s2">own rules with respect to conducting</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:30.880" style="s2">military operations</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.520" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">this is true have greater liberty and</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">offers plausible deniability to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">nations in question so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">terrible reasons for it but um</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">yeah and wealth inequality between</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:43.279" style="s2">nations so post-national-ish</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">too but wealth inequality between</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.279" end="01:08:47.920" style="s2">nations such that you can hire</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:49.440" style="s2">mercenary armies from poorer nations um</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.920" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">because people are more desperate for</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.440" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:53.679" style="s2">yeah yep</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:08:57.920" style="s2">were either of you born with a palmyras</p>

<p begin="01:09:01.359" end="01:09:04.719" style="s2">yes i was not born with one i was able</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.719" end="01:09:08.480" style="s2">so i actually don&#39;t know what it is i</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.560" end="01:09:11.679" style="s2">don&#39;t either okay um</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.480" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">no idea how would we know uh probably uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.679" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">you would have been told because</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">something that other people with a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">polymerase longus tendon can do</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:23.440" style="s2">uh you cannot or or some such</p>

<p begin="01:09:37.199" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know how does one</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:43.679" style="s2">differentiate between adaptive traits</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:45.700" style="s2">and maladaptive traits nested in larger</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">well so we&#39;ve i think talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:55.440" style="s2">adaptive test before</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.239" end="01:09:58.560" style="s2">if not i have a video on it somewhere in</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.440" end="01:10:00.640" style="s2">my youtube channel but um</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.560" end="01:10:02.159" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way the adaptive test</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.640" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">works at any scale</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.159" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">it basically says a complex</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.360" end="01:10:13.520" style="s2">is made out of materials or involves</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">energetic expense or involves</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.520" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">risk in which there is variation in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">amount of expense</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">and the amount of expense does not go</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">down over time</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">is adaptive so if you had</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:30.159" style="s2">a trait you know let&#39;s say that you had</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.159" style="s2">an appendage let&#39;s say we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.159" end="01:10:35.520" style="s2">about the wing of a bird and it has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.159" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">lump on the leading edge right</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.520" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">well that lump is made out of stuff if</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">the lump does not go away over time then</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:44.000" style="s2">it is paying its way</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:44.640" style="s2">now that is different than what seems to</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:46.239" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.640" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">hinted at in your question that you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:52.480" style="s2">trade-off where something that is not</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">vestigial</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:56.400" style="s2">is nonetheless preserved though it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">costly</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.400" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">because of some larger benefit that it</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">produces</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a distinct phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">where the adaptive test is not relevant</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:08.800" style="s2">because basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">it will come up positive as presumably</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.800" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">adaptive and the reason it will come up</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">positive is because the net effect</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">is positive good okay we&#39;re going to go</p>

<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:29.600" style="s2">um this is calling it a</p>

<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:53.280" style="s2">that was a joke oh really yes sometimes</p>

<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">uh so yeah given that neither of us had</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">heard of this before it&#39;s hard to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">um we&#39;ve spoken before about</p>

<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">this is for yet so we&#39;re going to assume</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:10.560" style="s2">it&#39;s useless</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">but given that there appears to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.560" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">according to what what zac pulled up on</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">wikipedia anyway a lot of variation</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:21.199" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t appear according to wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">to have an effect on grip strength</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.199" end="01:12:24.719" style="s2">maybe it is just a variant there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:25.920" style="s2">know there&#39;s lots of variants there are</p>

<p begin="01:12:25.920" end="01:12:30.080" style="s2">um the way the aorta leaves the heart</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:31.440" style="s2">and um you know some are presumably</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.080" end="01:12:32.480" style="s2">better than others but there&#39;s also just</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">a lot of variation</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.480" end="01:12:38.800" style="s2">within humans so this may just be</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">a variant and not that is inherently</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.800" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">disappearing but just</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">exists and some doesn&#39;t exist in others</p>

<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to build strength you</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.239" end="01:15:43.199" style="s2">need to have people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">tell you when you</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.360" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">wrong instead but</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.719" end="01:15:52.239" style="s2">you need that you need to have that</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:54.320" style="s2">tension but</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.239" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">coming from a sense of the security of</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.320" end="01:15:57.520" style="s2">even when we disagree</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">we actually respect and love each other</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.520" end="01:16:01.920" style="s2">underneath that</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">i would add uh you need to take your</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.920" end="01:16:05.760" style="s2">wounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">and scar over that there is this</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.760" end="01:16:11.679" style="s2">fascination with keeping wounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:15.040" style="s2">open and wallowing in their consequences</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.679" end="01:16:17.199" style="s2">and the wounds are likely</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.040" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">real but the best thing you can do just</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.199" end="01:16:19.600" style="s2">as if it was a physical wound on your</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:23.040" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.600" end="01:16:24.480" style="s2">is generate scar tissue and figure out</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.040" end="01:16:25.600" style="s2">how to move on which doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.480" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">wound isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.600" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">you know a historical fact for you but</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:33.040" style="s2">i would also point out that this is some</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.040" end="01:16:36.480" style="s2">uh this overlaps our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:39.520" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.480" end="01:16:42.159" style="s2">my conversation with greg lukyanov</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.520" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">where he talks about the fact that woke</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.159" end="01:16:46.800" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.600" end="01:16:50.480" style="s2">effectively is the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.800" end="01:16:53.440" style="s2">of cognitive therapy which teaches you</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.480" end="01:16:54.400" style="s2">to put these wounds to bed and move on</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.440" end="01:16:57.679" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.400" end="01:16:58.800" style="s2">woke ideology causes you to emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.679" end="01:17:01.120" style="s2">them and keep them open</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.800" end="01:17:02.320" style="s2">so anyway yeah i believe that this was</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.120" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">actually this is one of his</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.320" end="01:17:05.840" style="s2">insights that caused him to reach out to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:07.120" style="s2">jonathan height in the first place and</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.840" end="01:17:08.320" style="s2">for them to write that atlantic article</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.120" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">and then to write the coddling of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:12.080" style="s2">american mind that his</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:13.120" style="s2">own experience with when i say cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.080" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.120" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">was so at odds with what he was seeing</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">in students who were so fragile and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:23.040" style="s2">in need of safe spaces</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:23.040" style="s2">yep yep</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">any advice on living with a woke brother</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.840" end="01:17:29.199" style="s2">who tells me i&#39;m racist</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:30.320" style="s2">stupid and want people to die because i</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.199" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with him</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.320" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">those are the top three insults he uses</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">can you find a new place to live my god</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:40.000" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">that&#39;s awful i&#39;m sorry i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.000" end="01:17:45.760" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.120" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">if it were me i think i would point out</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.760" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:52.080" style="s2">you know at some point you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">realize how wrong that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.080" end="01:17:56.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re just gonna be embarrassed</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:17:59.760" style="s2">that you ever believed it</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.640" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">and you might invest now</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.760" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">in some thought process that</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.199" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">won&#39;t leave you wanting to flee your own</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.080" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">skin</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">you know so you&#39;re you&#39;re this guy</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:12.719" style="s2">asking the question speaking to his</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:14.239" style="s2">brother</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.719" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">is that is that the voice you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.239" end="01:18:18.400" style="s2">here yeah okay i&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:20.640" style="s2">you know i think a lot of this stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.400" end="01:18:22.640" style="s2">like it&#39;s the right thing to say this</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.640" end="01:18:23.440" style="s2">minute to get civilization to turn over</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.640" end="01:18:26.480" style="s2">some stuff</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.440" end="01:18:28.640" style="s2">and the point is you&#39;re just gonna be so</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.480" end="01:18:30.480" style="s2">horrified that you ever said those</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.640" end="01:18:33.760" style="s2">things because they were never</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.480" end="01:18:38.080" style="s2">you know right they were never plausible</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.760" end="01:18:41.600" style="s2">and um you know i mean i do wonder</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:44.080" style="s2">at whatever point this turns around</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.600" end="01:18:45.280" style="s2">um i think a lot of people are just</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.080" end="01:18:46.000" style="s2">going to pretend that they never said</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.280" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.000" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">of course they are uh you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">going to sanitize all evidence that they</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:54.640" style="s2">said anything on social media</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2">and if friends or family members are</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.640" end="01:18:58.000" style="s2">bold enough to bring it up</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.000" end="01:18:59.600" style="s2">they&#39;ll say it didn&#39;t happen yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.000" end="01:19:02.080" style="s2">actually you know what maybe that is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:03.520" style="s2">proper approach what i&#39;m very reluctant</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.080" end="01:19:06.159" style="s2">to give people</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.520" end="01:19:07.840" style="s2">uh advice that makes any of this sound</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.159" end="01:19:09.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s not dangerous or that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.840" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">something to be done because i i worry</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.600" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t very much to be done</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:15.040" style="s2">but maybe the point is you know what</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">would you write that down for me</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.040" end="01:19:18.960" style="s2">i want you to remember that you said</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.239" end="01:19:20.480" style="s2">that i want you to know</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.960" end="01:19:22.000" style="s2">that when you&#39;re saying these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.480" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">things somebody is paying</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.000" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">attention and at the point these things</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:27.679" style="s2">turn out to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">yeah uh clearly insane and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">understands that</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be able to walk away</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">from them yeah right and you can do it</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:35.120" style="s2">symmetrically you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:36.560" style="s2">no it&#39;s not a trap i will also write</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.120" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">down for you what i think</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.560" end="01:19:40.480" style="s2">exactly in fact maybe that&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:42.800" style="s2">one can we put the two</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.480" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">can we both write what we think read</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.800" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">put them in an envelope seal it and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.480" end="01:19:49.440" style="s2">know if you also want a copy fine but</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.320" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">i&#39;m going to keep a</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.440" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">keep a keep a copy i i i like this</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:54.719" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:56.560" style="s2">pulling rank the point is look you</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.719" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">really believe that let&#39;s write down</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.560" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">what we both believe</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:00.880" style="s2">and freeze it in place and let&#39;s revisit</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:04.159" style="s2">it yeah now that</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.880" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">um freezing what you think</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.159" end="01:20:08.159" style="s2">um really being able to go back to what</p>

<p begin="01:20:08.159" end="01:20:14.080" style="s2">is so critical to um</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.679" end="01:20:15.600" style="s2">god does so many things to doing good</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.080" end="01:20:17.600" style="s2">science to being a good friend</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.600" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">to being in a relationship that makes</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:20.639" style="s2">sense to you know to so many things and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.639" end="01:20:26.639" style="s2">nearly impossible because our brains</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.840" end="01:20:27.520" style="s2">accommodate to protect us from our own</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.639" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">wrongness</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.520" end="01:20:30.560" style="s2">and um and they lie on our behalf yep</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.560" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">that&#39;s good i like that yeah another</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:36.080" style="s2">version of it might be i dare you to</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">journal it</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.080" end="01:20:39.440" style="s2">you you think you&#39;ve got this all wired</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:41.120" style="s2">you think you understand how this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.440" end="01:20:42.480" style="s2">works i dare you to journal it and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.120" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">just revisit</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.480" end="01:20:46.960" style="s2">yes it doesn&#39;t have to involve me you</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:46.960" style="s2">journal it for yourself and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:52.080" style="s2">no i actually i this is absolutely one</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.400" end="01:20:54.639" style="s2">of the values of journaling i think you</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.080" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">know journaling in general is um</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.639" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">somewhat gendered right it&#39;s more likely</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:20:59.360" style="s2">to be something that women do than men</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">and i and i do and i&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.360" end="01:21:04.960" style="s2">more and less um at times but you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:05.679" style="s2">pretty consistently throughout my life</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.960" end="01:21:08.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.679" end="01:21:12.000" style="s2">i do go back and i do</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.719" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">find it instructive to know for sure you</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:14.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">not to say that i was right then but i</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.560" end="01:21:18.960" style="s2">do remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.360" style="s2">usually um yes i really did think that</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.360" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">yep this is like this this was written</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:24.560" style="s2">contemporaneously</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:25.600" style="s2">uh with of the other actions that were</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.560" end="01:21:27.600" style="s2">happening whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.600" end="01:21:28.960" style="s2">so whether or not i was right about it i</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.600" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">am not i have not</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.960" end="01:21:33.199" style="s2">sanitized my own memory of how i felt</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:36.320" style="s2">about it then actually this is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.199" end="01:21:39.280" style="s2">key to your own thought process</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.320" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">being upgraded is keeping ruthless track</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.280" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">of what you believed and figuring out</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.040" end="01:21:45.679" style="s2">whether or not it turned</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:48.000" style="s2">out to be right it&#39;s not always fun but</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.679" end="01:21:49.120" style="s2">one does get better at avoiding the</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.000" end="01:21:51.600" style="s2">errors if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.120" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">spot the pattern yeah okay one last</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.600" end="01:21:55.600" style="s2">question for today</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:57.440" style="s2">do you know why most animals keep their</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.600" end="01:21:58.400" style="s2">brains in their heads surely they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.440" end="01:22:01.920" style="s2">safer places</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.400" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">cheers tim this is such a good question</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.920" end="01:22:04.560" style="s2">i know i love this so</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:07.120" style="s2">we could go so many places with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.560" end="01:22:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s only one good answer though oh</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.120" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">okay you go first then all right you got</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.960" end="01:22:11.520" style="s2">your answer you&#39;ve locked it down how</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:14.960" style="s2">vlog you want me to</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.520" end="01:22:16.719" style="s2">journal it wasn&#39;t that kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.960" end="01:22:20.000" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.719" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">i would just say i believe the reason</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.000" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">is because it minimizes the neurological</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:32.159" style="s2">distance to your eyes your</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:35.920" style="s2">uh your nose and your taste buds</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.159" end="01:22:38.880" style="s2">so the idea is um so we sort of think in</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.920" end="01:22:41.600" style="s2">terms of wires and wires</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.880" end="01:22:43.920" style="s2">transmit signals at light speed so</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.600" end="01:22:46.880" style="s2">distances like down your arm are not</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.920" end="01:22:48.400" style="s2">meaningful it&#39;s so fast neurons aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.880" end="01:22:49.440" style="s2">like this even though the impulses are</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.400" end="01:22:51.520" style="s2">electrical the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.440" end="01:22:53.040" style="s2">they&#39;re actually chemical right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.520" end="01:22:56.960" style="s2">influx of electrons</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.040" end="01:22:59.360" style="s2">into or ions into the the axon</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.960" end="01:23:00.000" style="s2">that causes the impulse to propagate</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.360" end="01:23:02.560" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.000" end="01:23:04.159" style="s2">these neurons and that means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.560" end="01:23:07.280" style="s2">actually quite slow</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.159" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">and so the body has to correct for those</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.280" end="01:23:11.280" style="s2">things to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:12.880" style="s2">you know a giraffe has a much worse</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.280" end="01:23:15.199" style="s2">problem getting accurate</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.880" end="01:23:15.920" style="s2">immediate timely information from its</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.199" end="01:23:19.040" style="s2">limbs</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.920" end="01:23:20.239" style="s2">than does a squirrel because it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.040" end="01:23:22.880" style="s2">physically longer distance and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.239" end="01:23:26.400" style="s2">transmission rate isn&#39;t any higher so</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.880" end="01:23:30.400" style="s2">anyway the point would be keeping your</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.400" end="01:23:31.840" style="s2">eyes near your brain so that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.400" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">information that comes in your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.840" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">immediately reaches your brain and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:37.440" style="s2">can therefore react</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s useful is</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.440" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">desirable and so that&#39;s true for every</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">sensory modality</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:46.880" style="s2">and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.040" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">also i would say from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.880" end="01:23:51.760" style="s2">of protecting your brain a big</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:55.120" style="s2">vulnerable organ um information where</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.760" end="01:23:56.800" style="s2">you know your sense organs are</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.120" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">right near it so that you know if</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.800" end="01:23:59.360" style="s2">there&#39;s some projectile coming at you</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:02.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.360" end="01:24:04.080" style="s2">are likely to see it right so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.480" end="01:24:05.679" style="s2">proximity to your sense organs is the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.080" end="01:24:07.280" style="s2">short answer awesome</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.679" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">um so that is actually not the answer i</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.280" end="01:24:09.360" style="s2">was going to give but the answer i was</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:13.040" style="s2">going to give</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.360" end="01:24:14.800" style="s2">is uh is conciliate with that answer</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.040" end="01:24:17.440" style="s2">which is a phylogenetic one</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.800" end="01:24:18.719" style="s2">which is to say uh brains actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.440" end="01:24:20.800" style="s2">evolved brains in</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.719" end="01:24:22.239" style="s2">crania involved with the wait for</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:24.159" style="s2">craniates</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.239" end="01:24:26.159" style="s2">which is uh which is sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:27.920" style="s2">important moment just after chordates</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.159" end="01:24:30.639" style="s2">evolved just after our notochords</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.920" end="01:24:31.760" style="s2">uh evolved and just before vertebrates</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.639" end="01:24:33.840" style="s2">our vertebral</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.760" end="01:24:34.880" style="s2">column evolved so right in there we get</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.840" end="01:24:38.239" style="s2">these like</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.880" end="01:24:40.880" style="s2">brainy um single brains</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.239" end="01:24:42.159" style="s2">in crania uh which is again where all</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.880" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">the sense organs are</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.159" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">and that has not changed once in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">history of the craniata</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:52.400" style="s2">there are other animals uh like insects</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:54.719" style="s2">uh that don&#39;t technically have brains</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.400" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">and like cephalopods like</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.719" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">squid and octopi that actually have</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:00.480" style="s2">distributed</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">uh neural centers and don&#39;t have single</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.480" end="01:25:03.520" style="s2">brains and it&#39;s not that they have you</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:04.960" style="s2">know brains in their</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.520" end="01:25:07.280" style="s2">knees or something but they have</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.960" end="01:25:09.199" style="s2">distributed um</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.280" end="01:25:11.040" style="s2">distributed centers and with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.199" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">exception of the cephalopods</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.040" end="01:25:16.080" style="s2">it seems to have effects on how</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.840" end="01:25:19.600" style="s2">basically how cognitively</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.080" end="01:25:21.679" style="s2">complex they can get and so with um</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.600" end="01:25:22.960" style="s2">with craniates which is effectively</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.679" end="01:25:25.600" style="s2">vertebrates</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:27.280" style="s2">who evolved the brain in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.600" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">it probably evolved</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.280" end="01:25:30.960" style="s2">there where all the senses are are</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:31.600" style="s2">centered for exactly the reason that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">describe</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.600" end="01:25:36.159" style="s2">and then it had no reason to move any</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">move off of that particular local</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.159" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">maximum would have been</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:41.920" style="s2">immediately destructive of any organisms</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:43.440" style="s2">that tried to move their brain to their</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.920" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">knees or their butts or wherever it</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.440" end="01:25:48.239" style="s2">might have been</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:49.520" style="s2">thoughts yeah people have tried that</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.239" end="01:25:51.280" style="s2">sure which actually raises another</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.520" end="01:25:52.400" style="s2">question how many different times</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.280" end="01:25:55.280" style="s2">phylogenetically</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.400" end="01:25:55.760" style="s2">has a creature with a brain evolved to</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.280" end="01:25:59.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.760" end="01:26:01.360" style="s2">use it uh many many many times but</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.360" end="01:26:02.560" style="s2">always in the hominid lineage</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.360" end="01:26:05.600" style="s2">interesting yeah</p>
