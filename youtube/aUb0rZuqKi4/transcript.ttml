<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">strangely enough the fact you just said</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">strange to enough reveals that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">right in the middle of the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:25.260" style="s2">crisis exactly in this was a national</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:37.649" style="s2">so that you know if anybody looks at</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">this afterwards which obviously oh well</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.649" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">then you know that there was a specific</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">at that date this is actually a former</p>

<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">like what Heidegger and and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">Badou and many other four losses dealt</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">dickfist and I do and he believed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">this is the fundamental aspect the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">reality then certainly events is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">name the philosophical name for specific</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">things that happen throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">that changed everything forever once</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">they happen right and it could very well</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">be that the corona virus pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:20.299" style="s2">going to be one of those events yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">certainly stuff breaking into our</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.299" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">reality all aspects of our lives and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">reality yeah so if you talk say to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">really good epidemiologist they will</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">probably say this is not the big one you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">know the big pandemics and history kill</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">they killed just about everybody they</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">kill usually 1/2 or 1/3 of population</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">that&#39;s not going to happen this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">around but it&#39;s looking very bad so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">is not Marx on TV it&#39;s looking very bad</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">in southern Europe at the moment where</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">you see the worse than it ever was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">China and and of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">sympathetic now with Italians and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">Spanish and increasingly the French who</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">are now suffering from yeah maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">we could talk about that I&#39;m living in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">in Paris and on full full on isolation I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">can&#39;t go out in the street without a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">piece of paper yeah saying that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:11.660" style="s2">going for a walk for exercise or I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">to go to this pharmacy or go shopping</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.660" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">yeah I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:17.550" style="s2">you know in a week pretty much getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:19.710" style="s2">all the groceries delivered so</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:21.630" style="s2">Scandinavia where I live we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.710" end="00:02:24.300" style="s2">of cases the very few deaths so far this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.630" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">is March 19 it could of course get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.300" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">worse it could get like France or even</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:30.240" style="s2">like Italy we know that but here in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">Scandinavia we are more of a sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.240" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">improvised seam isolation so people take</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:36.210" style="s2">responsibility for themselves you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">they they buy groceries for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.210" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">neighbors if the neighbors are elderly</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">or sick or anything and but we still go</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:44.190" style="s2">to the shops</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">I would even out to a restaurant last</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.190" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">night to support the local you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:51.180" style="s2">small business around here but we sat</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:53.280" style="s2">very separately from other guests and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">minimize the risk here but it&#39;s far less</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.280" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">hysterical I would say than in France</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">but also we&#39;re either after the curve or</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:00.960" style="s2">way more lucky when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:04.440" style="s2">Scandinavia so that&#39;s the situation here</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.960" end="00:03:06.240" style="s2">on March 19 mm-hmm and and of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.440" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">concerned in my 86 year old mother she</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.240" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">got out of surgery a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">she&#39;s the feast just most wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.660" style="s2">woman in the world but she lives in her</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">own house in the countryside and I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.660" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">a brother and sister look after her when</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">needed but we try to minimize her</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:19.020" style="s2">contacts with the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">turns out it&#39;s heard about my neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.020" end="00:03:23.489" style="s2">who had just had a stroke so and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:25.380" style="s2">supposed to go in contact her and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.489" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">normally we talk a lot and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.380" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">very awkward situation you know it is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">is awkward</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">certainly awkward if your urban if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">live in a you know in a big city right</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">now but we know from Italy for a fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">already that the average age of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:43.860" style="s2">people who die from this disease is 79</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">and a half no it is older elderly people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.860" end="00:03:48.810" style="s2">who are most at risk and people who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:51.030" style="s2">certain previous dispositions and health</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.810" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">problems I&#39;ve got to ask for my sauce</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.030" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">I&#39;m actually listed on that list so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:58.260" style="s2">should be careful I guess you know your</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.470" style="s2">things go hmm we&#39;ll know more in three</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.260" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">months time obviously this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.470" end="00:04:04.860" style="s2">commentary you are making today where</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:07.530" style="s2">the philosophy certainly will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.860" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">timeless but the news feed is specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.530" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">for March 19 it&#39;s there right so um so</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">we I was thinking like we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.600" style="s2">about you know we as we&#39;re doing right</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:21.930" style="s2">now what&#39;s happening now and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.600" end="00:04:23.190" style="s2">you could sort of predict what you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.930" end="00:04:24.790" style="s2">is going to happen what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.190" end="00:04:28.480" style="s2">ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.790" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">of this will be on all levels of society</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.480" end="00:04:34.690" style="s2">and and also maybe since you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">about history you could talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.690" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">usually happens and what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:41.320" style="s2">possibilities what what what are like</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:43.180" style="s2">what are the dangers like let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.320" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">totalitarian dangerous of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.180" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">thing and what are the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:50.860" style="s2">reconstructing how we live okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:53.200" style="s2">epidemics and pandemics is like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">part of philosophy every philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.200" end="00:04:56.350" style="s2">you know writes about it&#39;s as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">the philosopher i&#39;ts about the social</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.350" end="00:04:59.470" style="s2">sphere you write by human beings you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:01.240" style="s2">have to you have to approach pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.470" end="00:05:03.250" style="s2">and epidemics because they have there</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.240" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">are certain events or even trauma so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:08.680" style="s2">would say the traumas in human history</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">so for example we have the two biggest</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.680" end="00:05:12.280" style="s2">ones we suffered in the in the West at</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">least was was the big plague of the 6th</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.280" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">century they changed history forever you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:18.760" style="s2">know we talked a lot about of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:20.290" style="s2">Persian Empire went down and the major</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.760" end="00:05:20.830" style="s2">cause for the person in power went</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.290" end="00:05:23.170" style="s2">darling</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.830" end="00:05:24.940" style="s2">then in the next 100 years after that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.170" end="00:05:26.830" style="s2">plague was because the plague had killed</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.940" end="00:05:28.360" style="s2">almost half the population on the person</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.830" end="00:05:31.030" style="s2">and it was devastating</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.360" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">it didn&#39;t kill as many Arabs and as many</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.030" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">Europeans and that&#39;s exactly what Arabs</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:35.920" style="s2">so the Europeans came to dominate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:38.230" style="s2">Middle East in Europe after that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:40.300" style="s2">done so ever since but the Persians got</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.230" end="00:05:42.550" style="s2">out of the way and and it sort of became</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.300" end="00:05:44.230" style="s2">the Iranians we know today which is some</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:46.630" style="s2">more of an isolated nation between East</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.630" end="00:05:50.350" style="s2">Persian Empire was over by the by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:52.210" style="s2">7th century and this was because of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.350" end="00:05:53.350" style="s2">plague in the 6th century and of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.210" end="00:05:54.790" style="s2">we have another plague that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.350" end="00:05:56.580" style="s2">Europeans and Americans are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.790" end="00:05:58.750" style="s2">wind that&#39;s the one for the 14th century</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.580" end="00:06:00.900" style="s2">that was a massive plague that killed</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.750" end="00:06:03.700" style="s2">about third of the population of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.900" end="00:06:06.220" style="s2">he ironically also opened up for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.700" end="00:06:08.020" style="s2">Renaissance afterwards the once things</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.220" end="00:06:10.390" style="s2">get around but it takes a long time</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.020" end="00:06:12.460" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna suffer from a major economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.390" end="00:06:14.350" style="s2">recession follow this there&#39;s no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.460" end="00:06:18.280" style="s2">about that we&#39;re gonna mass unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:21.010" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a double tragedy for Italy</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.280" end="00:06:23.620" style="s2">because Italy economy was already you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.010" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">know totally in havoc before this</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.620" end="00:06:27.460" style="s2">happened it&#39;s not gonna get any better</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:29.380" style="s2">because of it so we don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.460" end="00:06:32.350" style="s2">ramifications in that sense but and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.380" end="00:06:33.910" style="s2">is not the big one even if it hurts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.350" end="00:06:34.990" style="s2">say that considering your thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.910" end="00:06:37.570" style="s2">people are dying in Europe at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.990" end="00:06:38.580" style="s2">and possibly also soon in North America</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.570" end="00:06:42.569" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.580" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">the fact is that the big ones hit the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.569" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">population a much wider scale hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:48.389" style="s2">up to a third or even half of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:50.430" style="s2">population to die eventually for the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.389" end="00:06:52.590" style="s2">plagues and this is not a plague in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.430" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">sense this is a virus and this is way</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.590" end="00:06:56.909" style="s2">more serious than a regular infants saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:59.610" style="s2">because a new virus as well it could be</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.909" end="00:07:01.919" style="s2">have a mortality rate that could be up</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.610" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">to 10 or 50 times higher than normal flu</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.919" end="00:07:06.150" style="s2">we don&#39;t know that yet so oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">going to do you have ways to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.150" end="00:07:11.370" style="s2">this sort of thing that we didn&#39;t let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:13.319" style="s2">say in the Middle Ages right so so so</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">maybe it would be much more lethal in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.319" end="00:07:21.150" style="s2">another context what so far it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.949" style="s2">horrible but since it kills old people</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.150" end="00:07:24.780" style="s2">already sick it doesn&#39;t kill the young</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.949" end="00:07:26.940" style="s2">people of the future because if it kills</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.780" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">young people our future the damage their</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.940" end="00:07:33.180" style="s2">overall damaged on society will last way</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:34.919" style="s2">way longer much worse you could even see</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.180" end="00:07:36.060" style="s2">a whole civilization go down because of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.919" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">that that&#39;s not gonna happen in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.060" end="00:07:40.440" style="s2">case obviously but but it is a danger</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.780" style="s2">when the elders of the society die I</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.440" end="00:07:44.729" style="s2">mean that yeah that&#39;s or something right</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.780" end="00:07:47.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the yeah astray of the Society of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.729" end="00:07:49.050" style="s2">the leaders that oh you could ask gay</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.370" end="00:07:52.020" style="s2">people for example they suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.050" end="00:07:54.090" style="s2">their own pandemic called HIV in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:57.469" style="s2">1980s and the 1990s before we got</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.090" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">medication that put a break to that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.469" end="00:08:02.099" style="s2">most of the gay people I talked to and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:05.250" style="s2">I&#39;m bisexual myself some part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.099" end="00:08:07.860" style="s2">LGBT movement them and most of the gay</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.250" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">guys today my generation of 59 they feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.860" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">that the generation older than me and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:15.479" style="s2">this generation that I belong to were</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">the ones who died right so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.479" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">shiniest brightest guys died obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">slept around the most and they were in</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:26.370" style="s2">most gorgeous so what was left was kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">of a pale coffee about the game um it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:30.539" style="s2">had been before that and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">they&#39;ve done great work fighting for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.539" end="00:08:34.079" style="s2">rights and you know fighting for not</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">being ostracized because of the deceased</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.079" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">they had and that work has been going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:39.930" style="s2">since the early 1990s and it&#39;s now on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:41.520" style="s2">global scale I mean you still have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.930" end="00:08:43.770" style="s2">fight for a fundamental gay rights in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.520" end="00:08:45.209" style="s2">places like Africa Russia today in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.770" end="00:08:47.100" style="s2">parts of the world gays have become</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.209" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">accepted by society they can even marry</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.100" end="00:08:50.430" style="s2">and have children these days but if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:52.260" style="s2">look at if you look at the overall</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.430" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">effects over the last 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.260" end="00:08:58.410" style="s2">I think the gay guys would agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:09:00.300" style="s2">that the whole culture as a whole is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.410" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">suffered and that means all of culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.300" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">stuff you know what I always talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:05.340" style="s2">androgynous people should consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">themselves to be an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.340" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">the overall Society</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:09.210" style="s2">yeah we always talk about the Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">State we should not never get out</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.210" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">separated from rest society they should</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">live in between men and women in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.690" end="00:09:16.010" style="s2">middle of society in between what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:19.290" style="s2">call the outer and the inner circles and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.010" end="00:09:21.960" style="s2">you can just look at like theater</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.290" end="00:09:23.550" style="s2">theater has become very nostalgic you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.960" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">to Broadway they play the same old place</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.550" end="00:09:27.420" style="s2">all over and over again and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">not old place is usually just a distant</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.420" end="00:09:32.520" style="s2">movie turning into a musical right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">the lack of imagination the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.520" end="00:09:37.110" style="s2">innovation in that area is enormous when</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">you can consider the fact the peanuts</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">are results you think of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:42.570" style="s2">should have been in the original</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:44.430" style="s2">playwrights today there are a few out</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.570" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">there like Bret Easton Ellis&#39;s guy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.430" end="00:09:48.750" style="s2">he&#39;s fantastic but if you think if the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">world should have had 40 or 50 Bret</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.750" end="00:09:53.340" style="s2">Easton Ellis&#39;s rather than just one</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:57.270" style="s2">uh-huh that&#39;s that&#39;s what we should have</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.340" end="00:09:59.790" style="s2">had if eighths hadn&#39;t happened so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.270" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">damage done when the younger part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.790" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">population get affected by disease it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">a cultural one also it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:07.860" style="s2">number of corpses of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:09.630" style="s2">people who suffer or get sick and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.860" end="00:10:13.860" style="s2">family tragedy is the go with that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.630" end="00:10:15.750" style="s2">he&#39;s also a younger people died in in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.860" end="00:10:18.420" style="s2">in the pandemic you get a massive</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.750" end="00:10:19.770" style="s2">cultural effect as well come on society</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.420" end="00:10:22.350" style="s2">as a whole that takes hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.770" end="00:10:25.110" style="s2">sometimes to compensate for this is more</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.350" end="00:10:26.610" style="s2">likely to be a decade or so but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.110" end="00:10:28.380" style="s2">want to speculate too much on the rest</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.610" end="00:10:30.660" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m following the news every day</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.380" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">and I work with epidemiologist um I&#39;m an</p>

<p begin="00:10:42.780" end="00:10:46.770" style="s2">very very difficult to make the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.180" end="00:10:49.230" style="s2">decisions at the right time you need a</p>

<p begin="00:11:11.250" end="00:11:14.970" style="s2">policies and how you&#39;re gonna solve the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.570" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">problem like this and of course also</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.970" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">some countries have invested in their</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.390" end="00:11:38.190" style="s2">next and I don&#39;t even want to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.400" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">about how bad that can be if we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.190" end="00:11:42.150" style="s2">warm weather it could could be part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:44.550" style="s2">the solution but we don&#39;t know that yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.150" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">right yeah as of March 19 we have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.550" end="00:11:48.120" style="s2">idea you know it&#39;s a whole new viruses</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:48.510" style="s2">so speculating on how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.120" end="00:11:51.060" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.510" end="00:11:54.810" style="s2">judging from previous virus pandemics is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.060" end="00:12:00.060" style="s2">very hard mmm but back to philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.810" end="00:12:02.730" style="s2">this is called event ology so what do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.060" end="00:12:04.590" style="s2">mean by Evan Tala gee it&#39;s okay there</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.730" end="00:12:06.660" style="s2">two ways of looking at the world you and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.590" end="00:12:09.540" style="s2">I explored this in the past in our the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.660" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">web costume one of them is no madala G</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.540" end="00:12:13.650" style="s2">and the other one is of ontology and no</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:16.500" style="s2">modalities the fundamental story of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.650" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">human tribe on the move yeah sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.500" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">the the two patriarchs the priest the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:23.850" style="s2">chief Cain and the monarch who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:26.400" style="s2">responsible to and the movement of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.850" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">triad over time we see the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.400" end="00:12:30.330" style="s2">returning in all the major religions so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:32.100" style="s2">we know for a fact that no modality is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.330" end="00:12:34.590" style="s2">something we can study today as the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.100" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">narrative of the so siient</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.590" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">the original nomadic tribe and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:41.640" style="s2">whole new science of sociology is</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:43.950" style="s2">exploring how human beings developed</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.640" end="00:12:47.100" style="s2">over a period of sixty to seventy</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.950" end="00:12:49.590" style="s2">thousand years were not much changed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.100" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">precisely because not much changed the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.590" end="00:12:53.340" style="s2">world view essentially this one it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">that every new year usually the spring</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.340" end="00:12:58.080" style="s2">you would celebrate the new year and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:12:59.700" style="s2">history would just repeat itself it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.080" end="00:13:02.820" style="s2">would just be a new here it literally a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.700" end="00:13:05.310" style="s2">new world would appear to you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.820" end="00:13:07.830" style="s2">and and that year would close the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.310" end="00:13:09.960" style="s2">spring when a new year would come yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.830" end="00:13:11.820" style="s2">so following every year because years</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.960" end="00:13:13.770" style="s2">all busy circular you would have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.820" end="00:13:15.630" style="s2">of time as being circular so everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.770" end="00:13:17.940" style="s2">we just come back to the same point all</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.630" end="00:13:19.260" style="s2">over again now what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.940" end="00:13:20.760" style="s2">permanent settlements</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.260" end="00:13:22.440" style="s2">years ago and that&#39;s also when things</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.760" end="00:13:25.100" style="s2">like pandemics and epidemics become</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.440" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">problematic because we settled down and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.100" end="00:13:29.070" style="s2">eventually instead of just going to war</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.690" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">with our neighbors all the time we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.070" end="00:13:34.430" style="s2">to make peace with them and we start to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:37.260" style="s2">trade with them now that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.430" end="00:13:39.000" style="s2">because trade creates an abundance that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.260" end="00:13:42.810" style="s2">human beings have never seen before so</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.000" end="00:13:45.150" style="s2">humanity explodes we go from at most 3</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.810" end="00:13:48.300" style="s2">million people as a whole on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.150" end="00:13:50.760" style="s2">during pure numerology we call it</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.300" end="00:13:52.230" style="s2">interstate we mix we start a mixed norma</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.760" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">dalla ji no knowledge is still the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.230" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">dominant mode in Chinese in Indian</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:59.720" style="s2">culture Hinduism is an omen illogical</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:02.250" style="s2">religion but we add to numerology</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.720" end="00:14:04.140" style="s2">starting in Persia three thousand seven</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.250" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">I know we add the idea that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.140" end="00:14:08.460" style="s2">an event ology is like a second religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:10.020" style="s2">this is basically religion to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.460" end="00:14:12.360" style="s2">for the military and religion for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.020" end="00:14:14.220" style="s2">priesthood themselves eventually becomes</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.360" end="00:14:16.740" style="s2">the more masculine aspect of religion</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.220" end="00:14:19.230" style="s2">and and so Astron ISM is the first and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.740" end="00:14:21.000" style="s2">original ontology this white cells</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.230" end="00:14:22.530" style="s2">associated with more efficient all the</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.530" end="00:14:28.650" style="s2">flesh they&#39;re a little bit like what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.360" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">mean by M ontology religion linear time</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.650" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s linear time so it means that no</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:35.940" style="s2">life does not repeat itself every year</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:37.260" style="s2">it means that no the new year we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.940" end="00:14:38.790" style="s2">celebrating this spring doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.260" end="00:14:40.700" style="s2">that the world has just died of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.790" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2">world has woken up again and be reborn</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.700" end="00:14:45.990" style="s2">for another year when it&#39;s a story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.740" end="00:14:46.440" style="s2">a story of a forward progression of some</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.990" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.440" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">yeah well development of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.250" style="s2">developmental story basically yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:55.350" style="s2">for example you take free day freeze</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.250" end="00:14:56.940" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy it&#39;s centrally</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:14:59.100" style="s2">understand he doesn&#39;t use these terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.940" end="00:15:01.260" style="s2">the terms arrive later we deal Delors in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.100" end="00:15:03.000" style="s2">the 20th century when he reads nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.260" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t brilliantly if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.000" end="00:15:06.270" style="s2">start a nietzsche you start by reading</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">to Mercer&#39;s book on each it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.270" end="00:15:11.460" style="s2">great start then you can read Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:14.070" style="s2">for himself after that but nature deals</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.460" end="00:15:15.810" style="s2">with the fact that I with every return</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.070" end="00:15:17.810" style="s2">of the same you know the term the term</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.810" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">mmm-hmm but it&#39;s ancient</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.310" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">it&#39;s what circular time and circular</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.770" style="s2">religion is all about Buddhism and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:28.710" style="s2">Hinduism and these religions are based</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.770" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">on it so the Nomad illogical return</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.710" end="00:15:31.890" style="s2">return of the same Eastern there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:33.030" style="s2">something is added to that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.890" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">essentially biological</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.030" end="00:15:36.930" style="s2">it starts in the salsa it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:39.150" style="s2">the nomads all in itself before we even</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.930" end="00:15:40.230" style="s2">settled and he&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.150" end="00:15:41.730" style="s2">the relation between the son of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.230" end="00:15:42.930" style="s2">father and the daughter and the mother</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:44.580" style="s2">because in the relation with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.580" end="00:15:48.900" style="s2">psychoanalysis the daughter just mimics</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:50.820" style="s2">the mother mm-hmm that&#39;s all she needs</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.900" end="00:15:52.410" style="s2">to do and she then gives birth to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.820" end="00:15:54.570" style="s2">children and these children are</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.410" end="00:15:56.010" style="s2">different from the child she was when</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.570" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">she was a child but that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.010" end="00:16:00.960" style="s2">difference you see within the matriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:02.580" style="s2">and the father rebelled against the I</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.960" end="00:16:05.070" style="s2">mean the son rebelled against the father</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.580" end="00:16:06.530" style="s2">no not rebels he doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:09.330" style="s2">necessarily but he&#39;s different he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.530" end="00:16:11.220" style="s2">slightly different and this little</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.330" end="00:16:13.020" style="s2">little difference he said the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.220" end="00:16:14.730" style="s2">is just like physics the small small</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.020" end="00:16:16.860" style="s2">differences make a hell of a difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.730" end="00:16:18.570" style="s2">at the end of the day always remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.860" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">that the small differences at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:22.680" style="s2">specific point in time make a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:25.500" style="s2">difference later that somebody coughed</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.680" end="00:16:28.290" style="s2">in Wuhan China probably in October in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.500" end="00:16:32.310" style="s2">2019 has turned the world upside down</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.290" end="00:16:33.900" style="s2">on 19 March 2020 mm-hmm okay so small</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.310" end="00:16:35.490" style="s2">things in biology and physics and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.900" end="00:16:37.710" style="s2">philosophy can make a hell of a</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.660" end="00:17:22.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what the outer circle manhood is</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.940" end="00:17:24.330" style="s2">all about and the fact that son is</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.920" end="00:17:26.190" style="s2">slightly different from the father means</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.330" end="00:17:28.170" style="s2">that with every loop of the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.190" end="00:17:31.530" style="s2">return of the same the next loop is</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.170" end="00:17:33.930" style="s2">slightly different hmm the new year this</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.530" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">year is not exactly the same as last</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.930" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:41.430" style="s2">mm-hmm so this is a sounds like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:43.410" style="s2">invention of time no linear time linear</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.430" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">time yes linear time what do they call</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.410" end="00:17:46.940" style="s2">that in Greece</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:48.289" style="s2">they differentiate between Kairos and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.940" end="00:17:49.700" style="s2">Chronos and in Greece they actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.289" end="00:17:51.919" style="s2">difference between how we perceive time</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.700" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">and how it actually operates okay so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.919" end="00:17:57.320" style="s2">no not even the Greeks the Greeks are</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:18:00.139" style="s2">still within circular time I would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.320" end="00:18:02.090" style="s2">most of the time they rarely leave that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.139" end="00:18:04.460" style="s2">concept is certainly predominant in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.090" end="00:18:07.460" style="s2">Plato and interact lives before him I</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.460" end="00:18:09.049" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that the Greeks do not</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.460" end="00:18:10.609" style="s2">really deal with linear time linear time</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.049" end="00:18:13.609" style="s2">definitely comes to Europe through the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.609" end="00:18:16.970" style="s2">Hebrews it comes through religion so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.609" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">biblical religion yes so linear time was</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.970" end="00:18:20.929" style="s2">founded by so rostered that was his</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:23.929" style="s2">biggest innovation more important than</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.929" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">monotheism and that later becomes</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.929" end="00:18:26.989" style="s2">Judaism and we know that Soros Jones and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:28.669" style="s2">Jews</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.989" end="00:18:29.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a long love affair with each</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.669" end="00:18:32.029" style="s2">other for thousands of years and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.960" end="00:18:34.159" style="s2">starts when the Persians conquer Babylon</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.029" end="00:18:36.289" style="s2">and they found a strange Egyptian sect</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.159" end="00:18:38.179" style="s2">called the Hebrews in Babylon and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.289" end="00:18:39.649" style="s2">set them free because the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.179" end="00:18:42.200" style="s2">the Hebrews already are practicing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.649" end="00:18:44.179" style="s2">a separate Yavin L or L in other night</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.200" end="00:18:46.700" style="s2">they have two different aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.179" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">divinity of God this exact like older</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.700" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">mosques are separating so after religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:53.629" style="s2">they obviously felt they were a kid like</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:55.789" style="s2">they get it and what reduced and God</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.629" end="00:18:57.350" style="s2">from the person&#39;s was the idea of linear</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.789" end="00:18:58.730" style="s2">time mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.350" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">so they started to write down their</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.730" end="00:19:02.330" style="s2">Bible with the Genesis and with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:03.859" style="s2">Exodus and everything and they rewrote</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.330" end="00:19:06.950" style="s2">of course which was the founding</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.859" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">mythology of the Hebrew religion was of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.950" end="00:19:10.879" style="s2">course the exodus out of Egypt mm-hm and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:12.830" style="s2">this is where it gets interesting with</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.879" end="00:19:14.509" style="s2">both Sigmund Freud and now we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.830" end="00:19:16.249" style="s2">working in the same area with a new book</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.509" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">on Soderquist and I were following up on</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.249" end="00:19:20.929" style="s2">Freud&#39;s Moses monotheism is that linear</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:23.779" style="s2">time also hits the Egyptians in a big</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.929" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">way through it not on 1300 before Christ</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.779" end="00:19:28.460" style="s2">right that&#39;s about 400 years after after</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:29.330" style="s2">the linear time revolution is happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.460" end="00:19:30.859" style="s2">Persia</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.330" end="00:19:32.210" style="s2">the Persians not to separate the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.859" end="00:19:34.309" style="s2">chieftain in the priests but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.210" end="00:19:36.409" style="s2">Egyptians try to unify them but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.309" end="00:19:38.749" style="s2">what dictatorship and tyranny starts in</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.409" end="00:19:40.489" style="s2">Egypt 1300 before Christ was still in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.749" end="00:19:41.749" style="s2">the Bronze Age long before the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.489" end="00:19:43.369" style="s2">exhalation this is what the really</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.749" end="00:19:46.159" style="s2">interesting things happen in human</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.369" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">history during the Bronze Age and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.159" end="00:19:50.419" style="s2">deep chest and formulate through it not</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:53.730" style="s2">on the idea of the chief Cain and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.419" end="00:19:56.430" style="s2">and the priest must be the same person</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.730" end="00:19:59.610" style="s2">mmm-hmm is monotheism in a dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.430" end="00:20:02.550" style="s2">world so the duality moves from</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.610" end="00:20:04.830" style="s2">chieftain and priest into you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.550" end="00:20:07.830" style="s2">internalized are you separate body and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.830" end="00:20:12.120" style="s2">soul okay the beginning of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.830" end="00:20:13.800" style="s2">schizophrenic dualism yeah that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.120" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">idea right existed because they already</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.800" end="00:20:17.880" style="s2">build pyramids so doing I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:20.070" style="s2">already rampant in Egypt and that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.880" end="00:20:24.060" style="s2">think is why it was Egyptians who</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.070" end="00:20:25.710" style="s2">invented that monic cult the Monica the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.060" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">call to the one so this is this is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.710" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">the cult of the unified priests and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:34.650" style="s2">priests and chief came into one person</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">and then of course acknowledgeable there</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:38.550" style="s2">was pure terror he died he&#39;s Sun</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">Tutankhamun&#39;s later murdered by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.550" end="00:20:42.690" style="s2">priests were in speculating you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:44.340" style="s2">either this could possibly be the origin</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.690" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2">of Judaism and that&#39;s as Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.340" end="00:20:47.910" style="s2">some of the mimicking Judas and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:49.740" style="s2">putting Christ on the cross thirteen</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.910" end="00:20:51.990" style="s2">hundred years later but we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.740" end="00:20:54.060" style="s2">the Jews rewrote the exodus out of Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.990" end="00:20:55.410" style="s2">instead of just Moses leading the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.060" end="00:20:57.330" style="s2">out of Egypt having one leader which</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.410" end="00:21:00.180" style="s2">would it be more Egyptian they started</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.330" end="00:21:02.010" style="s2">mimicking the Persian pattern the norm</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.180" end="00:21:03.390" style="s2">at a logical pattern which was that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.010" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">chief to the priests must be separate</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.390" end="00:21:07.620" style="s2">and that we got a match are pushing us</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:10.050" style="s2">all forward and these are the three holy</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.620" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">siblings in Judaism that&#39;s why in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.050" end="00:21:13.470" style="s2">Jewish returning of the Exodus are a Jew</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.760" end="00:21:15.780" style="s2">is fundamental that there&#39;s Moses</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.470" end="00:21:18.570" style="s2">there&#39;s Aaron and there&#39;s Miriam huh</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.780" end="00:21:22.260" style="s2">Aaron is a chieftain Moses is the priest</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.570" end="00:21:25.080" style="s2">and Miriam as the network okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.260" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">another kind of Trinity here Trinity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.080" end="00:21:27.240" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:29.040" style="s2">Trinity is all over the place triads as</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.240" end="00:21:30.870" style="s2">we call trails they&#39;re stable over time</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.040" end="00:21:32.820" style="s2">because detroit&#39;s it is a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.870" end="00:21:34.410" style="s2">construction even the American</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.820" end="00:21:35.820" style="s2">Constitution that would save America</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.410" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">today no matter what happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.820" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">coronavirus even the American</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:42.420" style="s2">Constitution is built on the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.360" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">of tribe obviously Aaron is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.420" end="00:21:46.830" style="s2">precedent Moses is to Congress and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:50.760" style="s2">Miriam is the Supreme Court same pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.830" end="00:21:53.100" style="s2">so a mythology that explodes because</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.760" end="00:21:54.930" style="s2">nearly restore Astron ism any of Judaism</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.100" end="00:21:56.940" style="s2">and in the Persian Empire as Thomas is</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.930" end="00:21:59.460" style="s2">practiced as the overall religion for</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.940" end="00:22:02.790" style="s2">the entire empire and they completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.460" end="00:22:05.100" style="s2">tolerate accept even endorse the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.790" end="00:22:07.650" style="s2">religion as a separate religion within</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.100" end="00:22:09.510" style="s2">so a stern ISM why do they do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.650" end="00:22:12.450" style="s2">they do precise because the rest ISM is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.510" end="00:22:13.890" style="s2">a universal religion where do doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.450" end="00:22:18.690" style="s2">what is practiced is the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.890" end="00:22:21.299" style="s2">nationalism alienation say Israel nation</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.690" end="00:22:23.190" style="s2">and ok again a nation state that we in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.299" end="00:22:25.080" style="s2">Europe of course started shaping up in</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.190" end="00:22:26.820" style="s2">the nineteenth century after the big</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.080" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">European empires fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.820" end="00:22:32.909" style="s2">so Empire as a concept is older the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:35.370" style="s2">nation way old the nation we both</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.909" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">empires as soon as we got out of our own</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.370" end="00:22:40.440" style="s2">permanent settlement started coming</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:42.870" style="s2">towards others but nationality we speak</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.440" end="00:22:45.000" style="s2">the same language we write the same text</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.870" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">we recite from the same text so we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.000" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">practice the same religious rituals</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:51.779" style="s2">starts with Judaism and what we then</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.110" end="00:22:54.929" style="s2">inherit in Europe is this shared Persian</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.779" end="00:22:57.000" style="s2">Jewish ancestry and that&#39;s when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.929" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">about European history we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.000" end="00:23:02.580" style="s2">Athens and Jerusalem mm-hmm and we today</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:03.870" style="s2">we discuss it like there&#39;s a history</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.580" end="00:23:05.820" style="s2">philosophy and there&#39;s a history</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.870" end="00:23:07.679" style="s2">religion mister philosophy starts with</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.820" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">the Greeks we call it Athens because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.679" end="00:23:11.130" style="s2">religion starts with Jerusalem and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">starts with the Hebrews</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.130" end="00:23:15.179" style="s2">but actually that&#39;s dead wrong to begin</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:16.950" style="s2">with only European culture separates</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.179" end="00:23:18.570" style="s2">philosophy and religion to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.950" end="00:23:19.230" style="s2">everything is religion everywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.570" end="00:23:21.120" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:23.700" style="s2">philosophy is only the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.120" end="00:23:25.380" style="s2">religion its theology essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.700" end="00:23:27.029" style="s2">I&#39;m adamant about that that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.380" end="00:23:29.399" style="s2">should look at it so there really isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.029" end="00:23:31.409" style="s2">a home on philosophy or a home religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.399" end="00:23:33.029" style="s2">here it&#39;s religion if laws are one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.409" end="00:23:35.309" style="s2">the same thing and it&#39;s just that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.029" end="00:23:39.620" style="s2">have linear time arriving from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.309" end="00:23:42.779" style="s2">Persian Jewish ancestry meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.620" end="00:23:46.020" style="s2">ontology in European culture has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.779" end="00:23:48.179" style="s2">person Jewish origin mm-hmm and Noah</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.020" end="00:23:50.610" style="s2">made ology is what we practice as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.179" end="00:23:52.470" style="s2">Greeks of the rumors mm-hmm and it comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.610" end="00:23:54.149" style="s2">out of Greek and Roman polytheism and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.470" end="00:23:56.730" style="s2">out of Greek and Roman philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.149" end="00:23:58.529" style="s2">literature mm-hmm okay that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.730" end="00:24:00.330" style="s2">better way of looking at European and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.529" end="00:24:02.580" style="s2">American history today is it&#39;s a look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.330" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">the origin here it&#39;s a shared one where</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.580" end="00:24:07.289" style="s2">no morality and haven&#39;t told you better</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:09.299" style="s2">words than philosophy religion so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.289" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">the way we perceive history and time and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.299" end="00:24:14.730" style="s2">what gives us meaning throughout time</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.460" style="s2">because if it&#39;s everything a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.730" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">returns to the same you might as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">throw away as many things you possibly</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">can as you go along because history is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:24.560" style="s2">going to start</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:27.590" style="s2">fresh from zero yeah with every new loop</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.560" end="00:24:29.480" style="s2">but with EV ontology what&#39;s weird is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.590" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">that suddenly it started write down all</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.480" end="00:24:32.630" style="s2">of history you started right on who was</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:34.550" style="s2">the son of whom who was the son of who</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.630" end="00:24:36.770" style="s2">was the son of omoro son of a and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.550" end="00:24:37.850" style="s2">get obsessed with the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.770" end="00:24:39.320" style="s2">tribe where do you where does your</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.850" end="00:24:41.630" style="s2">family come from where does your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.320" end="00:24:44.870" style="s2">come from what was the father you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.630" end="00:24:48.680" style="s2">500 generations ago just seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.870" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">just you start to record human history</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.680" end="00:24:52.700" style="s2">right yes that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.290" style="s2">yeah cuz you can write because you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.700" end="00:24:56.540" style="s2">write because you have you cannot have</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.290" end="00:24:57.800" style="s2">linear time without writing and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.540" end="00:24:59.330" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen anybody make this</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.800" end="00:25:01.550" style="s2">connection before but I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.330" end="00:25:04.010" style="s2">deeper connection is that we know we</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.550" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">settled permanently some eight to ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.010" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">thousand years ago starting in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:09.710" style="s2">contemporary Kurdistan and along the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">river valleys this this way of living</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.710" end="00:25:12.770" style="s2">spread and because it was highly</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">successful when it came to feeding</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.770" end="00:25:17.300" style="s2">people the populations grow immensely</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:18.980" style="s2">suddenly half the population of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.300" end="00:25:20.660" style="s2">world lived in Mesopotamia and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.980" end="00:25:22.370" style="s2">India and China and in Egypt became</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.660" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">populated and of course it&#39;s became a</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.370" end="00:25:25.460" style="s2">waning model because you could create</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:27.980" style="s2">large armies out of farmers coming out</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.460" end="00:25:29.660" style="s2">of river routes right so that conquered</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:31.250" style="s2">the world that model but it was also</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.660" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2">tied to the idea you could write down</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.250" end="00:25:34.550" style="s2">and you did write down you wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">everything that had to do with farming</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.550" end="00:25:37.910" style="s2">you wrote down how many cattle you had</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:40.220" style="s2">when you were started raising cattle we</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.910" end="00:25:41.840" style="s2">also wrote down a new narrative and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.220" end="00:25:44.060" style="s2">new narrative had to be one that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:46.310" style="s2">just made up by shame and now about</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.060" end="00:25:47.900" style="s2">tomorrow in the trial I kind of want her</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.310" end="00:25:49.670" style="s2">to be it out to be it had to be year</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.900" end="00:25:52.160" style="s2">after year after year after year after</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.670" end="00:25:55.280" style="s2">year and this new obsession with linear</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.160" end="00:25:56.830" style="s2">time this event ology they became the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.280" end="00:26:00.140" style="s2">religions of the Middle East in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.830" end="00:26:02.270" style="s2">okay so I kind of want to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.140" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">the present now because I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.270" end="00:26:07.730" style="s2">that yes we have we&#39;ve had this recorded</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:09.880" style="s2">history of this event ology is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:12.020" style="s2">of religion and now we have the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.880" end="00:26:16.670" style="s2">where everything is being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.020" end="00:26:19.280" style="s2">recorded so so I wonder if you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.670" end="00:26:22.490" style="s2">talk about yeah I mean what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.280" end="00:26:24.230" style="s2">right now and if we could we could bring</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.490" end="00:26:27.170" style="s2">that back to the the whole issue of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.230" end="00:26:29.310" style="s2">pandemics and and oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.170" end="00:26:31.500" style="s2">absolutely I mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.310" end="00:26:33.900" style="s2">the benefit of writing down history is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:36.930" style="s2">that you do write down myths but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.900" end="00:26:38.760" style="s2">represent reality I mean if you write a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.930" end="00:26:41.700" style="s2">myth if you go to mythos instead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.760" end="00:26:43.860" style="s2">logos right know goes for example in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.700" end="00:26:45.810" style="s2">science logos is fact is mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.860" end="00:26:47.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s zeros and ones and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.810" end="00:26:49.980" style="s2">obviously you can only solve the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.130" end="00:26:51.660" style="s2">pandemic by going to logos mmm that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.980" end="00:26:56.040" style="s2">medical science that has to solve this</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.660" end="00:26:57.870" style="s2">problem but mythos is sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:26:59.820" style="s2">better way of telling a story to teach</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.870" end="00:27:01.890" style="s2">people how to live their lives properly</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.820" end="00:27:04.770" style="s2">so say no one in the arc for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.890" end="00:27:07.290" style="s2">obvious in this right so but the myths</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.770" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">are there in religion like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.290" end="00:27:10.200" style="s2">Peterson stresses all the time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">incredibly important to understand to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.200" end="00:27:14.490" style="s2">understand why they&#39;re there and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:15.990" style="s2">they teach us and obviously when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:17.400" style="s2">look at the myths one of the things they</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.990" end="00:27:18.660" style="s2">taught us early on when we started</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.400" end="00:27:20.040" style="s2">writing them down was that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.660" end="00:27:22.500" style="s2">conditions have changed and we become</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.040" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">permanent - settled now you have very</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.500" end="00:27:26.340" style="s2">different problems in a permanent -</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:29.340" style="s2">subtle society then you would have in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.340" end="00:27:33.180" style="s2">nomadic society yeah right for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.340" end="00:27:36.090" style="s2">you live it on the river flooding oops</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.180" end="00:27:39.660" style="s2">okay how do you make young men dream</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.090" end="00:27:41.310" style="s2">about irrigation so we can separate the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.660" end="00:27:42.780" style="s2">water distribute it over a larger piece</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.310" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">of land without getting flooding so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.780" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">like you created Delft on which you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.630" style="s2">farm yeah well there have been flooding</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:50.010" style="s2">all the time but it took thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.630" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">years for people to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.010" end="00:27:53.460" style="s2">how to avoid flooding in some place of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:55.410" style="s2">the world they still have it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.460" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">flooding causes enormous havoc and kills</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.410" end="00:27:59.070" style="s2">loads of people so if you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:01.830" style="s2">got flooding already it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.070" end="00:28:04.410" style="s2">going to happen then obviously also</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.830" end="00:28:06.120" style="s2">along the river while you&#39;re trading or</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.410" end="00:28:07.860" style="s2">between the river systems while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.120" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">trading which is the trade routes for</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.860" end="00:28:11.370" style="s2">example the Silk Route is north between</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:13.740" style="s2">is built between the major river valleys</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:15.150" style="s2">of the middle eastern Asia and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.740" end="00:28:16.710" style="s2">is the beginning and the end of all</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.150" end="00:28:19.320" style="s2">civilization to be honest about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.710" end="00:28:20.790" style="s2">city&#39;s amazing but obviously if you did</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.320" end="00:28:24.540" style="s2">trade for you know a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.790" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">years every now and then along the trade</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.540" end="00:28:29.340" style="s2">route also an innovation of an angry</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:32.250" style="s2">little mob of nomads would happen like</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.340" end="00:28:35.700" style="s2">the Mongols or a pandemic would spread</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.250" end="00:28:38.250" style="s2">mm-hmm so all of history is full of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.700" end="00:28:39.810" style="s2">these pandemics yeah so all of us</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.250" end="00:28:41.550" style="s2">there&#39;s foot of the floods it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.810" end="00:28:42.680" style="s2">the pandemics and epidemics and these</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.550" end="00:28:45.560" style="s2">things happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.680" end="00:28:47.960" style="s2">now obviously they happen even more</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.560" end="00:28:49.910" style="s2">today more than ever at a more frequent</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.960" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">level because we travel more and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.910" end="00:28:55.100" style="s2">interconnected than ever before yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:56.900" style="s2">for good or bad we also have cameras</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.100" end="00:28:58.970" style="s2">everywhere and we have microphones</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.970" end="00:29:04.580" style="s2">everything through our machines and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.920" end="00:29:06.140" style="s2">because we do this today we both can</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.580" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">spread the warning about a new disease</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.140" end="00:29:09.770" style="s2">like we did out of one China that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.940" end="00:29:11.750" style="s2">like five months ago from today harsh</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.770" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">lightning and all of the world knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.750" end="00:29:15.290" style="s2">about it within weeks it&#39;s possible the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:17.180" style="s2">Chinese hit it longer than they should</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.290" end="00:29:18.800" style="s2">have and that&#39;s also possible the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.180" end="00:29:21.260" style="s2">reasons why it&#39;s become so lethal and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.800" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">problematic but at least after a while</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.260" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">when that epidemic started spreading</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:27.770" style="s2">into Han China and the major city was</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">sort of struck by the pandemic it became</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.770" end="00:29:32.840" style="s2">known as the rest of world and the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:34.400" style="s2">idea that this could spread far outside</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.840" end="00:29:36.800" style="s2">of China and cost even more havoc</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.400" end="00:29:39.230" style="s2">elsewhere suddenly took root and this</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.800" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">happened very very quickly so also know</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.230" end="00:29:42.710" style="s2">we got tons of parallel studies around</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:44.390" style="s2">the world to try to see if this is there</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.710" end="00:29:46.370" style="s2">any medication that it sort of can put a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.390" end="00:29:47.660" style="s2">brake on this can help us out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.370" end="00:29:49.100" style="s2">also happening and there parallel</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.660" end="00:29:51.290" style="s2">studies being done around the world they</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.100" end="00:29:53.420" style="s2">put their studies online from day one so</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.290" end="00:29:55.970" style="s2">they don&#39;t work and say Washington state</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.420" end="00:29:57.800" style="s2">in America and Australia in China and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.970" end="00:30:00.740" style="s2">Holland in so isn&#39;t this the first time</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.800" end="00:30:03.950" style="s2">there&#39;s been a pandemic where where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.740" end="00:30:05.660" style="s2">whole world has to react sort of so no</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.950" end="00:30:07.730" style="s2">no that was ours</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.660" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">there was service which is closely</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.730" end="00:30:12.650" style="s2">related to this and SARS was stopped</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.590" end="00:30:15.110" style="s2">yeah SARS was even worse so let&#39;s let me</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.650" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">say the first pain ran slower yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.110" end="00:30:19.130" style="s2">a first and emic that&#39;s gone out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:21.020" style="s2">control that we need to every but like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.130" end="00:30:22.820" style="s2">during SARS I didn&#39;t have to isolate</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.020" end="00:30:25.040" style="s2">myself you didn&#39;t either I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.820" end="00:30:27.500" style="s2">everybod the Chinese thing effect yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.040" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">that everybody in the world is being yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.500" end="00:30:31.730" style="s2">yes so so yes that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not I think better example is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.730" end="00:30:36.830" style="s2">Spanish flu that happened at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.890" end="00:30:38.870" style="s2">the first world war starting in 1918 and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.830" end="00:30:40.820" style="s2">that was trying to get killed almost as</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.870" end="00:30:42.170" style="s2">many people as the war had and it killed</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.820" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">young people more than older people was</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.170" end="00:30:46.580" style="s2">actually the opposite effect really died</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:48.140" style="s2">and old people survived so the structure</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.580" end="00:30:48.350" style="s2">of that flu virus is different from this</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.140" end="00:30:50.930" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.350" end="00:30:53.720" style="s2">so the problem of this one is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.930" end="00:30:55.860" style="s2">causing a lot of havoc and Italy in Iran</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.720" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">especially our two tragedies already</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.860" end="00:31:00.150" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what happens next but and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">looks bad it looks really bad to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.150" end="00:31:07.980" style="s2">honest about it but SARS was more lethal</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:09.750" style="s2">then the copied 90 what the the name of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.980" end="00:31:11.640" style="s2">the virus is actually SARS - more or</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.750" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">less but it&#39;s copy 19 what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.640" end="00:31:16.679" style="s2">infection and copy 19 though it spreads</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:19.410" style="s2">easier and probably it&#39;s even so bad is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.679" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">March 19 again that it looks the last</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.410" end="00:31:23.100" style="s2">week it looks like it&#39;s symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">spread of the virus actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.100" end="00:31:26.309" style="s2">causing most of the problems that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.260" style="s2">happened initially in the office worried</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.309" end="00:31:30.929" style="s2">what does that mean a systemic spread a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.260" end="00:31:32.790" style="s2">symptomatic means that unless you start</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.929" end="00:31:33.990" style="s2">coughing and showing clear signs of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.790" end="00:31:36.169" style="s2">having the infection you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.990" end="00:31:38.040" style="s2">spreading it to anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.169" end="00:31:39.510" style="s2">automatic means that you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.040" end="00:31:41.010" style="s2">symptoms but you&#39;re still spread it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.510" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the worse because you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.010" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">know you&#39;re six you&#39;re probably gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:48.330" style="s2">on with your life the way you do so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.650" end="00:31:50.790" style="s2">don&#39;t know the country towards mass</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.330" end="00:31:53.010" style="s2">self-isolation in France in Italy and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.790" end="00:31:55.169" style="s2">Spain is based on the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.010" end="00:31:57.570" style="s2">problem in asymptomatic spread of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.169" end="00:31:59.669" style="s2">pandemic is so serious that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.570" end="00:32:00.990" style="s2">take it into the calculation otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.669" end="00:32:04.440" style="s2">you would have healthy people are self</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.990" end="00:32:06.419" style="s2">isolated yeah so we don&#39;t know yet this</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.440" end="00:32:08.040" style="s2">is again March 19 but we can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.419" end="00:32:10.290" style="s2">history from previous epidemics and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.040" end="00:32:12.210" style="s2">pandemics and certainly philosophy has a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.290" end="00:32:16.260" style="s2">lot to say about this especially when it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.210" end="00:32:18.299" style="s2">comes to event ology because once you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.260" end="00:32:20.160" style="s2">understand how important the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.299" end="00:32:21.750" style="s2">become to us after written language</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.160" end="00:32:23.820" style="s2">arrived and after he&#39;s settled</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.750" end="00:32:25.799" style="s2">permanently and after look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.820" end="00:32:27.900" style="s2">history all the way back back to the Big</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.799" end="00:32:32.429" style="s2">Bang with the big Big Bounce it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.900" end="00:32:34.890" style="s2">probably called now these 13.8 billion</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.429" end="00:32:36.840" style="s2">years of history it would be impossible</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.890" end="00:32:39.710" style="s2">for us as human beings to think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.840" end="00:32:42.330" style="s2">history that way and that way far back</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.710" end="00:32:45.210" style="s2">if we haven&#39;t invented the event</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.330" end="00:32:47.340" style="s2">illogical religions without Zoroaster</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.210" end="00:32:49.260" style="s2">Ness of Judaism Christianity and Islam</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.340" end="00:32:50.970" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t think of history that way</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.260" end="00:32:54.630" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t think of learn your</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.970" end="00:32:58.110" style="s2">history at all but we do now and we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.630" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">both we both have a conception of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.110" end="00:33:01.500" style="s2">history like circular certainly for</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:03.870" style="s2">ourselves of human beings because we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.500" end="00:33:05.580" style="s2">live and we die and hopefully we die</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.870" end="00:33:07.980" style="s2">somebody inherits us and take over</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.580" end="00:33:09.299" style="s2">everything and we can then transcend by</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.869" end="00:33:16.710" style="s2">the same thing that is a very circular</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.820" end="00:33:18.809" style="s2">concept of reality and that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.710" end="00:33:20.730" style="s2">fundamental to human life we can call</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.090" end="00:36:31.380" style="s2">for the next season yeah okay what am I</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:33.330" style="s2">going to save in terms of seeds for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.380" end="00:36:35.640" style="s2">next season well then the next ace is</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.330" end="00:36:37.290" style="s2">not identical to this one I might have</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.640" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">more or less seats next season than I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.290" end="00:36:41.940" style="s2">did this London okay then one year is</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:44.750" style="s2">different from the last year okay then</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.940" end="00:36:48.150" style="s2">the years follow one after the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.750" end="00:36:50.280" style="s2">okay then you get a time axis that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.150" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">not circular longer it&#39;s linear it can</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.280" end="00:36:54.180" style="s2">you can go all the way back to the Big</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:36:58.280" style="s2">that and it can go as far as you like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.610" end="00:37:01.740" style="s2">into the future now</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.280" end="00:37:04.190" style="s2">once you&#39;ve accepted of ontology you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.740" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">also accept that at certain dates</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.790" end="00:37:13.800" style="s2">we&#39;re saying March 19</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.710" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">2020 no because our obviously our</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.800" end="00:37:19.050" style="s2">discussion today here is so time</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">specific that&#39;s unavoidable concerning</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.730" end="00:37:27.380" style="s2">one thing you mentioned I think in our</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.500" end="00:37:30.030" style="s2">last talk about was it Lacan and and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.380" end="00:37:34.770" style="s2">imposition of the real right when the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.030" end="00:37:36.049" style="s2">real comes on yes and that that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.770" end="00:37:38.509" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.049" end="00:37:41.299" style="s2">what I feel like I&#39;m experiencing if I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.509" end="00:37:43.729" style="s2">can be personal very clever yes snobbish</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.299" end="00:37:46.849" style="s2">chic is written about this if you look</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.729" end="00:37:48.709" style="s2">at an event for society as a whole then</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.849" end="00:37:50.509" style="s2">obviously September 11 comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.709" end="00:37:52.519" style="s2">yeah and if you and I would have sat</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.509" end="00:37:54.410" style="s2">here on September 12 and had this</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.519" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">discussion he would have been avoidable</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.410" end="00:37:58.309" style="s2">not to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:38:00.619" style="s2">mm-hmm and speculate about it because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.309" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">couldn&#39;t know that much on September 12</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.619" end="00:38:04.309" style="s2">we can only speculate so we&#39;re in a bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:05.929" style="s2">of the same position all right in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.309" end="00:38:07.459" style="s2">middle of the corona pandemic hitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.929" end="00:38:09.979" style="s2">Europe in a bad way were you and I live</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.459" end="00:38:11.660" style="s2">it&#39;s March 19 so it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.979" end="00:38:13.729" style="s2">we&#39;re in the middle of the event itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.660" end="00:38:15.709" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible not to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.729" end="00:38:17.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s when the real hits you and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.709" end="00:38:20.089" style="s2">and the way Lacan describes is that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.719" end="00:38:23.509" style="s2">have two ways of you two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.089" end="00:38:25.369" style="s2">fantasies your imaginary fantasy and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.509" end="00:38:27.140" style="s2">have your symbolic fantasy your</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.369" end="00:38:30.349" style="s2">imaginary fantasies what you fantasize</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.140" end="00:38:32.089" style="s2">about vague your abstract way and your</p>

<p begin="00:38:32.089" end="00:38:35.539" style="s2">symbolic one because it&#39;s tied to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.380" end="00:38:38.059" style="s2">language itself mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.539" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">okay so you live in these two fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.059" end="00:38:41.420" style="s2">worlds you live in a fantasy world the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.380" end="00:38:43.789" style="s2">language in a fantasy world of pure</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.420" end="00:38:44.509" style="s2">imagination and suddenly the real</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.870" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">the move and the people who decided the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:51.600" style="s2">permanent to settle and he knew the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">people who permit the subtle would then</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.600" end="00:42:56.370" style="s2">have history they would have a Year Zero</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:58.710" style="s2">this is where we settled before that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.370" end="00:43:01.260" style="s2">history only repeated itself there is no</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.710" end="00:43:02.460" style="s2">counting of time there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.260" end="00:43:04.170" style="s2">calendar</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.460" end="00:43:05.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no calendar there&#39;s no calendar</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.170" end="00:43:07.140" style="s2">before you settle permanently there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.550" end="00:43:09.090" style="s2">there&#39;s no need for account that starts</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.140" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">with a year zero and then as a year one</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.090" end="00:43:13.940" style="s2">and a year or two and a year three and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:16.470" style="s2">year four hmm right and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.940" end="00:43:17.970" style="s2">eventually when new events happen that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.470" end="00:43:19.560" style="s2">you claim are more important than the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.970" end="00:43:21.810" style="s2">original event then you get Christian</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.560" end="00:43:23.790" style="s2">existed well Christ on Christ was born</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.810" end="00:43:25.740" style="s2">so because he was born that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.790" end="00:43:28.350" style="s2">important than the birth of the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.740" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">text so we&#39;re gonna make this year zero</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.350" end="00:43:32.130" style="s2">and then we have before years hero</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:33.660" style="s2">before Christian error and after okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.130" end="00:43:35.100" style="s2">and the must substitute the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.660" end="00:43:36.810" style="s2">later they don&#39;t even have child month</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.100" end="00:43:38.970" style="s2">and their calendar is very confusing but</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.810" end="00:43:39.720" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re gonna be totally</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.970" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.720" end="00:43:43.620" style="s2">year series should be the publication of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:45.860" style="s2">the gothis which is about three thousand</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.620" end="00:43:51.180" style="s2">seven hundred seventy-five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.860" end="00:43:54.990" style="s2">because that date to your history that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.180" end="00:43:56.910" style="s2">the first event the first event</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.990" end="00:44:00.450" style="s2">according to event ology according to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.910" end="00:44:02.970" style="s2">linear time first like okay I see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.450" end="00:44:04.860" style="s2">within like the story of humanity begins</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.970" end="00:44:07.710" style="s2">at this point yeah linear time it only</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.860" end="00:44:10.980" style="s2">existed temporarily within circular time</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.710" end="00:44:12.490" style="s2">before that it exists in men existing</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.980" end="00:44:14.110" style="s2">the outer circuit because</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.490" end="00:44:17.050" style="s2">their time is the beginning of logos</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.110" end="00:44:19.750" style="s2">well okay but what about like in a Haida</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.050" end="00:44:23.710" style="s2">Indian group they have their stories</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.750" end="00:44:27.460" style="s2">about the origin of their their clan and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.710" end="00:44:28.600" style="s2">and and how it came to be and yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.460" end="00:44:30.280" style="s2">it&#39;s different they&#39;ll be what is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.600" end="00:44:32.530" style="s2">difference yeah the difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.280" end="00:44:33.580" style="s2">they will then celebrate that every year</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.530" end="00:44:36.100" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.580" end="00:44:39.070" style="s2">so if you may see early odd goes through</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.100" end="00:44:40.690" style="s2">these stories anthropology is that so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.070" end="00:44:43.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a birth of the world at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.690" end="00:44:45.990" style="s2">certain point in time then every year at</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.240" end="00:44:48.460" style="s2">that time the world is being reborn</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.990" end="00:44:49.900" style="s2">mm-hmm therefore there is no specific</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:51.400" style="s2">date for the birth of the world itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.900" end="00:44:53.380" style="s2">mmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.400" end="00:44:55.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the same time every year so say you</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.380" end="00:44:57.910" style="s2">celebrate midsummer which old pagans do</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.240" end="00:45:01.060" style="s2">it was still doing in in you know post</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.910" end="00:45:03.940" style="s2">Christian Scandinavia a midsummer is</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.060" end="00:45:06.280" style="s2">like the the longest day of the year the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.940" end="00:45:08.170" style="s2">shortest night which is end of June and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.280" end="00:45:10.150" style="s2">you celebrate that because it&#39;s the peak</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.170" end="00:45:12.580" style="s2">obviously the calendar and it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.150" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">eight every year that&#39;s eternal return</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.580" end="00:45:17.350" style="s2">because they&#39;re exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:20.770" style="s2">erna lee whereas an event like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.350" end="00:45:25.960" style="s2">coronavirus or yeah Jesus or whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.770" end="00:45:27.910" style="s2">it changes history yes yes so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.960" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">could say even that the corona virus</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.910" end="00:45:32.230" style="s2">pandemic is currently structured is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:33.820" style="s2">event the influenza virus the returns</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.230" end="00:45:36.970" style="s2">every winter is it typically</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.820" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">neurological mm-hmm phenomena so we</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.970" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">don&#39;t use the word event for that try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:42.900" style="s2">use the word event only for of ontology</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:46.270" style="s2">is where it&#39;s specific in timing unique</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.900" end="00:45:47.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the way Heidegger and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.270" end="00:45:49.690" style="s2">by do you use it before me and said it</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.890" end="00:45:52.090" style="s2">is so so event all it is about that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.690" end="00:45:54.820" style="s2">rather in the Norma dalla ji it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.090" end="00:45:57.820" style="s2">ritual so I&#39;ve never ever here in</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.820" end="00:46:00.609" style="s2">Scandinavia heard a Scandinavian talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.820" end="00:46:03.790" style="s2">about the first midsummer yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.609" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s incomprehensible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.790" end="00:46:07.000" style="s2">just no midsummer celebrating at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:08.590" style="s2">midsummer and Midsummer&#39;s have existed</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.000" end="00:46:10.810" style="s2">forever yeah got it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.590" end="00:46:12.310" style="s2">so that is no nology yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.810" end="00:46:14.470" style="s2">Neurology and you will discover that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.310" end="00:46:16.270" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that women</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.470" end="00:46:18.210" style="s2">actually take more to Norma knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.270" end="00:46:21.010" style="s2">and mate it men take more terminology</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.210" end="00:46:22.510" style="s2">hmm in general population there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.010" end="00:46:24.850" style="s2">of women are brought into dermatology</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.510" end="00:46:25.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of men who are very</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.850" end="00:46:27.880" style="s2">good know-it-all</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.990" end="00:46:29.589" style="s2">but overall in terms of populations</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.880" end="00:46:31.150" style="s2">again we see these patterns of a large</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.589" end="00:46:33.580" style="s2">populations that when you come to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.150" end="00:46:35.710" style="s2">outer circuit and hunting and warfare</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.580" end="00:46:38.080" style="s2">activities that dominate that circle men</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.710" end="00:46:39.820" style="s2">arm usually located young voice is fired</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.080" end="00:46:41.349" style="s2">to be heroes when they grow up to be</p>

<p begin="00:46:45.339" end="00:46:48.369" style="s2">place that are much more geared towards</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:57.099" style="s2">because men want to construct the future</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.609" end="00:46:59.140" style="s2">right yes and when they&#39;re a good at</p>

<p begin="00:47:01.480" end="00:47:07.869" style="s2">also take care of the community and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">a great split it&#39;s not a problem it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.869" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">pandemic we&#39;ll discover that certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.339" end="00:47:16.599" style="s2">female traits are very useful women are</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">very very very good at carrying the beat</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.599" end="00:47:21.099" style="s2">the shit oh man here men are usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:23.020" style="s2">better at saved overall planning we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.099" end="00:47:24.790" style="s2">gonna go we go to put the resources not</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.020" end="00:47:26.500" style="s2">not there&#39;s a lot of women who good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.790" end="00:47:28.510" style="s2">that job the men in general more</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.500" end="00:47:30.430" style="s2">specialized at that also the irony here</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.510" end="00:47:32.320" style="s2">is that so far also the virus has hit</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.430" end="00:47:33.910" style="s2">more men than women and one man that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.320" end="00:47:35.800" style="s2">know it has I didn&#39;t know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.910" end="00:47:37.450" style="s2">no women the female body has an</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.800" end="00:47:40.599" style="s2">advantage apparently when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.450" end="00:47:44.530" style="s2">how it reacts to the virus and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.599" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">also very common it you know it&#39;s men</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.530" end="00:47:48.849" style="s2">often die younger and under more violent</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:50.140" style="s2">circumstances the women do mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.849" end="00:47:51.510" style="s2">and that is because of the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.140" end="00:47:54.130" style="s2">the body they&#39;re more vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.510" end="00:47:56.349" style="s2">physiologically more vulnerable mmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.130" end="00:47:57.940" style="s2">interesting yeah the opposite right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.349" end="00:47:59.560" style="s2">would think that stronger more</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.940" end="00:48:01.540" style="s2">physically stronger but that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.560" end="00:48:06.430" style="s2">prize than pay for being physically</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.540" end="00:48:09.190" style="s2">stronger interesting but you also you</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.430" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">mentioned something we started playing</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.190" end="00:48:12.070" style="s2">around with a new word who were working</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">with now and you&#39;re we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.070" end="00:48:16.599" style="s2">said acknowledge each other exit all you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.700" style="s2">so Ditka past neither I love this word I</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.599" end="00:48:21.790" style="s2">love this I love this word because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.700" end="00:48:25.630" style="s2">something it&#39;s like this is what has to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.790" end="00:48:28.510" style="s2">be done exid ology yeah in a way like</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.630" end="00:48:30.670" style="s2">think of all the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.510" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">difficulties of dealing with the corona</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.670" end="00:48:35.859" style="s2">virus and i&#39;m thinking about what needs</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:37.900" style="s2">to be done as a teacher i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.859" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">about schooling and education and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.900" end="00:48:42.470" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">and that is it need what needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.470" end="00:48:47.750" style="s2">done is to move from the old dead</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:51.170" style="s2">structures into the new whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.750" end="00:48:53.960" style="s2">yes yeah so what happens now is that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.170" end="00:48:59.000" style="s2">exid ology of our time is obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.960" end="00:49:01.160" style="s2">move from physical into digital so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.000" end="00:49:04.190" style="s2">was ironic to accelerate because of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.160" end="00:49:05.420" style="s2">this is smart seems to be already March</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.190" end="00:49:06.950" style="s2">19 we&#39;re in the middle of a huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.420" end="00:49:08.360" style="s2">financial crisis across the Western</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.950" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">world is still Amazon announced</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.360" end="00:49:11.600" style="s2">yesterday they&#39;re about to employ a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:14.450" style="s2">hundred thousand more people in North</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.600" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">America so all this year</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.450" end="00:49:21.050" style="s2">II tried is taking off in a massive way</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:22.820" style="s2">at the moment ecommerce around</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.050" end="00:49:24.410" style="s2">restaurants and hair salons and all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.820" end="00:49:26.120" style="s2">small bases I think the large companies</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.410" end="00:49:27.950" style="s2">would be saved but but the small</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.120" end="00:49:29.480" style="s2">companies are gonna have a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.950" end="00:49:31.610" style="s2">time over the next few months to survive</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.480" end="00:49:33.380" style="s2">right so that&#39;s the real economic</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.610" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">tragedy is going on at the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:36.110" style="s2">that&#39;s also why the isolation probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">has to be broken sooner or later also</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.110" end="00:49:41.420" style="s2">for economic reasons otherwise although</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:42.980" style="s2">society falls apart but when this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.420" end="00:49:44.900" style="s2">happening would you talk about it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.980" end="00:49:46.280" style="s2">EXO dolla jia plied in our times makes a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.900" end="00:49:47.810" style="s2">Dalek is going on our time is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.280" end="00:49:52.760" style="s2">Atticus I&#39;ve written in all our books</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.810" end="00:49:55.640" style="s2">this is the paradigm shift from an urban</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.760" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">physical society / - a virtual digital</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.640" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">society yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:00.110" style="s2">- moving online and we&#39;re doing in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:01.550" style="s2">rapid pace because obviously you and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.110" end="00:50:04.940" style="s2">can have this conversation and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.550" end="00:50:06.950" style="s2">concern you not Trevor I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.940" end="00:50:08.750" style="s2">totally weird I teach 25 hours of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.950" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">classes a week and they&#39;re all online</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.750" end="00:50:13.400" style="s2">now and all these lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:15.620" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do this kind of shit their way</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:17.510" style="s2">in the old in the past or having to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.620" end="00:50:19.580" style="s2">learn all this these new structures and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.510" end="00:50:21.950" style="s2">communicate with each other in a totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.580" end="00:50:25.840" style="s2">different way and yes and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.950" end="00:50:25.840" style="s2">exodus it&#39;s too happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.990" end="00:50:30.470" style="s2">because I could stay at home and work</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.250" end="00:50:32.150" style="s2">you know and I don&#39;t have to go take the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.470" end="00:50:33.410" style="s2">train I&#39;m sorry to be speak so</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.150" end="00:50:36.200" style="s2">personally I know we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.410" end="00:50:38.770" style="s2">larger things than than just just me and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.200" end="00:50:38.770" style="s2">you but</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.260" end="00:50:44.730" style="s2">ya know but this is happening overall I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.540" end="00:50:46.410" style="s2">mean there&#39;s no set backs to the digital</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.730" end="00:50:49.290" style="s2">realm at the moment it&#39;s moving it</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.410" end="00:50:50.970" style="s2">forward fast and quickly and taking over</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.290" end="00:50:52.290" style="s2">the old structures and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.970" end="00:50:54.810" style="s2">about this for the last thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.290" end="00:50:56.910" style="s2">obviously this is an exodus right a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.810" end="00:50:58.320" style="s2">paradigm shift for all of society and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.910" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">all of the world is moving in that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.320" end="00:51:05.490" style="s2">direction so exid ology is the study of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:08.430" style="s2">exodus so which are the big Exodus is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.490" end="00:51:10.980" style="s2">all history and how do they operate some</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.430" end="00:51:14.010" style="s2">of them are physical like exodus out of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.980" end="00:51:15.750" style="s2">Egypt exodus out of Babylon or say when</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.010" end="00:51:17.430" style="s2">Europeans moved on masse from Europe to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.750" end="00:51:19.590" style="s2">North America in the 19th century there</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.430" end="00:51:21.390" style="s2">was a huge Exodus oh so you have these</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.590" end="00:51:24.270" style="s2">big movements throughout history and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.390" end="00:51:27.090" style="s2">people moved from place one to place to</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.270" end="00:51:30.390" style="s2">look but it of course we moved all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.090" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">time we were nomads so no madala G would</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.390" end="00:51:34.050" style="s2">would mean a kind of permanent exceed</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">ology so that would be a realm of</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.050" end="00:51:39.510" style="s2">permanent Exodus today&#39;s global.nomads</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">to travel what they have travelled until</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.510" end="00:51:43.410" style="s2">now they probably locked up somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:44.849" style="s2">now a few months but usually the global</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.410" end="00:51:46.320" style="s2">moment to travel all the time gonna fly</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.849" end="00:51:48.390" style="s2">everywhere and who lived their lives in</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.320" end="00:51:50.339" style="s2">airport hotels and things like that part</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.390" end="00:51:52.560" style="s2">of that circuit myself they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.339" end="00:51:54.510" style="s2">obviously nomads of today and no no</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.560" end="00:51:56.010" style="s2">Matala G therefore returns in a big way</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.510" end="00:51:57.480" style="s2">because understanding yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.010" end="00:51:59.430" style="s2">person who&#39;s on the move all the time</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.480" end="00:52:02.190" style="s2">makes sense in every wood that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.430" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">beneficial so if you can be global</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.190" end="00:52:04.950" style="s2">moment it turns out that&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:06.810" style="s2">you have a career while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.950" end="00:52:09.089" style="s2">successful you you get the lifestyle you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.810" end="00:52:12.089" style="s2">desire then obviously Nomad ologies the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.089" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">right word for that but the a clinic</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.089" end="00:52:16.109" style="s2">serology that we work with here really</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:18.450" style="s2">is also what&#39;s important here if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.109" end="00:52:22.700" style="s2">gonna unify numerology and have ontology</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.450" end="00:52:25.410" style="s2">mm-hmm and try to tell a shared story</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.700" end="00:52:28.859" style="s2">mm-hmm the shared story would have to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.410" end="00:52:32.490" style="s2">called the accede ology mmm-hmm because</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.859" end="00:52:35.250" style="s2">it is unifier I&#39;m not yeah so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.490" end="00:52:37.859" style="s2">describe a society today where both</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.250" end="00:52:39.630" style="s2">history is so important and when we have</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.220" end="00:56:48.100" style="s2">sense okay something major happened the</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.850" end="00:59:32.660" style="s2">to be honest about it there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.100" end="00:59:34.490" style="s2">scientific products that would be folded</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.060" end="00:59:56.450" style="s2">to talk about the positive effects in</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.770" end="00:59:58.820" style="s2">corona virus pandemic right in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.450" end="01:00:01.490" style="s2">middle of it I think it&#39;s just it just</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.820" end="01:00:03.800" style="s2">smacks of escapism to me now I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.490" end="01:00:05.020" style="s2">it&#39;s much better to look at the ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.800" end="01:00:07.940" style="s2">spiritual revolution that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.020" end="01:00:09.710" style="s2">but right now it&#39;s not about sitting</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.940" end="01:00:11.270" style="s2">there praying it&#39;s all about going out</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.710" end="01:00:12.380" style="s2">knocking on your neighbors doors and ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.270" end="01:00:13.730" style="s2">them if you can help them out with</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.380" end="01:00:16.280" style="s2">something that&#39;s that&#39;s really how you</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.730" end="01:00:18.380" style="s2">become a real Mensch right now in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.280" end="01:00:20.630" style="s2">middle of the crisis and and then we</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.380" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">have to compare in Europe we compare the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.630" end="01:00:24.890" style="s2">different constant can we please avoid</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:25.850" style="s2">the Italian disaster or now the Italian</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.890" end="01:00:27.260" style="s2">Spanish disaster</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.850" end="01:00:29.420" style="s2">can you avoid in the rest of Europe well</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.260" end="01:00:30.860" style="s2">hopefully we can and hopefully Italy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.420" end="01:00:33.110" style="s2">Spain can be better off three weeks from</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.860" end="01:00:35.690" style="s2">now but it&#39;s gonna take weeks for this</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.110" end="01:00:36.950" style="s2">to change maybe even months and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.690" end="01:00:39.620" style="s2">know where the damage is going to end</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.950" end="01:00:41.150" style="s2">right now we&#39;re March 19 and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.620" end="01:00:42.620" style="s2">it&#39;s just I think it&#39;s a waste of time</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.150" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">to speculate when you can actually go</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.620" end="01:00:46.610" style="s2">out and help your neighbors okay I agree</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:49.400" style="s2">a hundred percent more spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.610" end="01:00:51.350" style="s2">approach right now we have we just we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.400" end="01:00:53.950" style="s2">just seen our fantasies about the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.350" end="01:00:53.950" style="s2">crushed</p>
