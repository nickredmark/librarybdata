<p begin="00:00:03.710" end="00:00:11.250" style="s2">if the data we have already is for real</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">and you know one can always discover</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">that there&#39;s a problem at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">the data that you&#39;re not in a position</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:18.570" style="s2">no but assuming that the data is what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:20.660" style="s2">think it is there won&#39;t be a gaijin can</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.570" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">there be gay genetic influences sure</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.660" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">that could be but there are patterns</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">that are simply inconsistent with a gay</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:34.950" style="s2">gene and what&#39;s more I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">questions are insurmountable as to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.950" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">whether or not a gay gene could</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">propagate evolutionarily but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:46.520" style="s2">simple question of how they would but in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:50.329" style="s2">any case the to build the protection of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.520" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">homosexuals on the idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.329" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">simply no environmental influence and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">therefore as you argue in the book that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:00.480" style="s2">effectively it would be immoral to hold</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">people responsible for something over</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.480" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">which they had no control that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">sound foundation now it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">people have very little choice</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">especially here we&#39;re gonna step on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">big landmine okay or I am you go first</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">okay at least for males there is likely</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">to be not very much choice because the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">switch will have been flipped very early</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">right so in any case we don&#39;t need a gay</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">gene in order to fully support the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">argument for compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">understanding but it was a useful crutch</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">before we had enough information to know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:51.380" style="s2">what was going on and people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">understandably reluctant to give it up</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.380" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">yeah by the way the landmine you just</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">deftly deftly tripped over it without</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:02.579" style="s2">least one ones the fascinates me because</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">I say to everyone who complains about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:06.570" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying about gay bit that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">I say look it maybe it&#39;s a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.570" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">maybes a bit more mellifluous even after</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">a certain stage than we pretend</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:19.320" style="s2">and that a gay isn&#39;t necessarily as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:23.160" style="s2">say a one-way street even the people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.320" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">object to that deeply concede I might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.160" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">onto something in the case of female</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:31.710" style="s2">lesbianism right well cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">definitely more there&#39;s definitely more</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.710" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">adaptability there than there is among</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:41.550" style="s2">male homosexuals but I mean for instance</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:43.530" style="s2">I mean you do sometimes there are some</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:45.960" style="s2">lesbians who have had horrible</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.530" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">experiences with men or had a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.960" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">husband or worse and they end up falling</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:54.300" style="s2">in love with a woman I do not know of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">any case with a man who&#39;s married to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.300" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">most horrible woman and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">starts to screw around with men I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:07.550" style="s2">you know as a straight guy it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">me to imagine a woman that horrible but</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.550" end="00:03:13.980" style="s2">that&#39;s it I&#39;m leaving you I&#39;m gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:16.100" style="s2">local gay bar as a result yep but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.980" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">if you think about it look the reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.100" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">that this should be more flexible on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">lesbian side is staring us in the face</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:24.989" style="s2">it&#39;s just obvious as you said it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:29.610" style="s2">that hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.989" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">gay men have a really and you know again</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.610" end="00:03:33.570" style="s2">among the many amazing points that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">make in this book that I&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.570" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">anybody else say but you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">begging for an exploration gay men have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">a problem producing babies the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">of the moment may be that they don&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">you know Monty Python correctly nailed</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">the fact that a pair of men don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.790" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">uterus you know and therefore that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:03:59.220" style="s2">invites questions about how it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:02.610" style="s2">to be done women don&#39;t have this problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.220" end="00:04:07.110" style="s2">in fact a lesbian couple has a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.610" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">uterus right what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.110" end="00:04:12.300" style="s2">there is an opportunity here let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:14.570" style="s2">do this straightforwardly in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">evolutionary sense human babies are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.570" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">extremely expensive to raise and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">are much better raised when people team</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:27.310" style="s2">up right so a straight partnership is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:29.050" style="s2">team and its primary objective</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.310" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">is the successful raising a baby&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.050" end="00:04:34.570" style="s2">production of resources the nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:39.340" style="s2">the delivery of information on how to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.570" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">a successful human a single individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.340" end="00:04:43.300" style="s2">has a problem raising a baby there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:46.870" style="s2">just not enough labor it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.300" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">labor-intensive a pair of lesbians has</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.870" end="00:04:53.560" style="s2">the labor and the uterus is what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">lack is a single cell right all they</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.560" end="00:04:57.070" style="s2">need is a single cell to trigger a baby</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:05:01.419" style="s2">and then everything else they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.070" end="00:05:03.550" style="s2">right now there are plenty of ways that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.419" end="00:05:06.910" style="s2">history can deliver a circumstance in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.550" end="00:05:09.850" style="s2">which there aren&#39;t enough men around</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.910" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">for example warfare warfare will</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.850" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">eliminate men from the map are we really</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.500" style="s2">to imagine that evolution will take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:19.389" style="s2">bunch of people who are perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.500" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">capable of raising offspring and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.389" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">sideline them from that most</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:25.120" style="s2">fundamentally Darwinian objective</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.300" style="s2">because there aren&#39;t enough men around</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.120" end="00:05:29.350" style="s2">for people to pair off oh no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.300" end="00:05:32.050" style="s2">how it&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.350" end="00:05:35.169" style="s2">surely people who have everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.050" end="00:05:39.100" style="s2">necessary to produce offspring of their</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.169" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">own will team up and do so especially if</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.100" end="00:05:42.550" style="s2">all they need in order to trigger the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:45.850" style="s2">process is a single cell they&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.550" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">one right and so the point is lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.850" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">couples make perfect evolutionary sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">in many circumstances and that would</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:55.750" style="s2">mean that the ability to facultative ly</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:59.200" style="s2">go in that direction at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.750" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">it becomes a viable path forward should</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.200" end="00:06:03.940" style="s2">be there as a contingency plan built-in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:05.380" style="s2">to women we can&#39;t make the same argument</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.940" end="00:06:07.300" style="s2">for men at some point I will make an</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.380" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">argument for the evolutionary nature of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.300" end="00:06:11.740" style="s2">male homosexuality but I&#39;m not ready to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">deploy it in public just yet I have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.740" end="00:06:17.020" style="s2">say I do want you to do that bread all</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:19.030" style="s2">right well you know I lay down that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.020" end="00:06:21.460" style="s2">Chinese slightly in the book I say look</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.030" end="00:06:24.940" style="s2">the evolutionary biologists have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.460" end="00:06:27.250" style="s2">ducking this one for a long time now yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:29.650" style="s2">ducking notice there&#39;s plenty of room</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.250" end="00:06:35.710" style="s2">under the table here for me to to duck</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.650" end="00:06:39.580" style="s2">if I must all right so where were we we</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.710" end="00:06:41.560" style="s2">were talking about the understandable</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.580" end="00:06:43.570" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.560" end="00:06:46.270" style="s2">amongst people who feel that they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.570" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">something personal at stake to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.270" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">certain kinds of exploration and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:53.350" style="s2">others of us find those explorations are</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:56.470" style="s2">necessary even to the very protection at</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.350" end="00:07:01.240" style="s2">the focus of that concern right I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.470" end="00:07:03.490" style="s2">say gay people are far safer if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.240" end="00:07:07.530" style="s2">explore this carefully then if we</p>
