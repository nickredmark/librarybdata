<p begin="00:00:05.410" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">Imagine that we have a cylinder.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">A cylinder is a very simple, three-dimensional<br />object but imagine that we have two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:14.640" style="s2">creatures trying to make sense of a cylinder.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.640" end="00:00:17.930" style="s2">It’s like the flatland conversation.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.930" end="00:00:24.850" style="s2">So two-dimensional creature intersects the<br />cylinder this way and they see a circle.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.850" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">And in a two-dimensional world a circle is<br />a very clear object, makes perfect sense.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:32.890" style="s2">They can describe the mathematics of it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.890" end="00:00:37.080" style="s2">And they can verify that empirically they<br />really did see a circle.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.080" end="00:00:41.880" style="s2">Of course a two-dimensional create that happens<br />to be in another plane could bisect the cylinder</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.880" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">like this and see a rectangle.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:47.960" style="s2">And they could be very clear on that also<br />and they’re both partially true but they’re</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.960" end="00:00:52.870" style="s2">also both totally wrong in that rectangle<br />and circle are both two-dimensional objects</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.870" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">and the thing they’re encountering is a<br />three-dimensional object that actually can’t</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:00.100" style="s2">be understood in the dimensionality that they’re<br />in.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.100" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">So then we can see that a debate ensues between<br />the two-dimensional creatures in orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.990" style="s2">planes, the circlers and the rectanglers,<br />who are both utterly sure that the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.990" end="00:01:18.130" style="s2">they’re seeing is what they think it is<br />and obviously rectangle and circle are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.130" end="00:01:20.860" style="s2">exclusive descriptions of reality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.860" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">One has no corners and straight lines.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:26.570" style="s2">One is define exclusively by corners and straight<br />lines.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:31.810" style="s2">So it’s easy to see how one can hold a kind<br />of reductive fundamentalist perspective without</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.810" end="00:01:32.980" style="s2">even thinking that it is that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.980" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">It’s just what I’m observing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:37.900" style="s2">An so then they can debate.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.900" end="00:01:41.710" style="s2">Let’s imagine that one of the two-dimensional<br />creatures was able to switch planes and see</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.710" end="00:01:45.080" style="s2">the other one and see that there was some<br />truth in both of them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.080" end="00:01:50.830" style="s2">Then they could flip flop between perspectives<br />at different times or they could say we just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.830" end="00:01:51.830" style="s2">need to hold paradox.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.830" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">It’s both and neither which mostly means<br />give up on making sense of reality.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:01:59.950" style="s2">Or they say it’s a middle path that’s<br />somewhere between the two.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.950" end="00:02:04.030" style="s2">And a middle path in two dimensions is like<br />a rounded rectangle where you kind of do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.030" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">that’s a little bit circle-ish and a little<br />bit rectangle-ish which isn’t even any true</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">part of what a cylinder is.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:17.870" style="s2">And the thing is that they’re just at too<br />low of a dimensional perspective to properly</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.870" end="00:02:20.490" style="s2">understand the nature of cylinder which is<br />actually a very simple thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.490" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">It doesn’t require holding paradox.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:25.250" style="s2">It doesn’t require a middle path in that<br />way.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.250" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">And it’s because when we think of middle<br />path oftentimes we’re thinking of extremes</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:31.480" style="s2">on left or right in a gradient.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.480" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">But sometimes the two different perspectives<br />aren’t on a gradient on a single axis.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:38.450" style="s2">They’re orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:44.210" style="s2">And the reason why this is kind of actually<br />an interesting example is because perception</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.210" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">itself, a perspective on something defined<br />by perception is inherently a reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:50.540" style="s2">information of the thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.540" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">My perspective of it is going to be a lot<br />less total information than the actual thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">is.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:02.780" style="s2">So I can look at the object from the east<br />side or the west side or the top or the north</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.780" end="00:03:05.130" style="s2">side or the inside, microscopically, telescopically.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.130" end="00:03:07.320" style="s2">They’ll all give me different information.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.320" end="00:03:11.170" style="s2">None will give me the entirety of the information<br />about the situation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.170" end="00:03:16.930" style="s2">And so there is no all encompassing perspective<br />that gives me all of the information about</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.930" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">really almost any situation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">And so what this means is that reality itself<br />is trans perspectival.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">It can’t be captured in any perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:32.710" style="s2">So multiple perspectives have to be taken,<br />all of which will have some part of the reality,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.710" end="00:03:33.710" style="s2">some signal.</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.710" end="00:03:34.710" style="s2">There may also be distortion.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.710" end="00:03:39.240" style="s2">I may be looking at the thing through a fisheye<br />lens or through a colored lens that creates</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.240" end="00:03:40.240" style="s2">some distortion.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.240" end="00:03:46.709" style="s2">But then let’s say I’m looking at a building<br />and the picture, the 2D picture from the east</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.709" end="00:03:51.100" style="s2">side and from the west side and from inside<br />a particular room and the aerial view are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.100" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">all obviously very different pictures and<br />it’s because the 3D complex building actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">can’t be seen in a 2D process.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">So I could take a lot of pictures and I could<br />seam them together into a kind of video that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">moves through the building.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:11.440" style="s2">Now by having a video I added the dimension<br />of time and I got back to kind of the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.440" end="00:04:13.349" style="s2">dimensionality to be able to understand the<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.349" end="00:04:14.840" style="s2">But that’s not a perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.840" end="00:04:17.709" style="s2">That’s a lot of perspectives that we’re<br />able to put together.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.709" end="00:04:20.419" style="s2">So why does this matter.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.419" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">Well, when we’re looking at political processes<br />and we think about classically political left</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:32.150" style="s2">kind of perspectives that have more to do<br />with the orientation of the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.150" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">the whole and political right that have more<br />to do with the individual and sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">On the right do we want people who are more<br />self-responsible and who are more sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">and who are more empowered.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:50.060" style="s2">And do we want to give more power to people<br />who are doing a better job.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.060" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">All of that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:53.090" style="s2">Left perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.090" end="00:04:57.860" style="s2">Do we want to create situations that actually<br />influence the individuals in the situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.860" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">to do better – social systems, education,<br />healthcare.</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:03.370" style="s2">Does the environment affect the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.370" end="00:05:07.980" style="s2">You can really think of it as does the environment<br />affect the individual while understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.980" end="00:05:13.220" style="s2">evolutionary theory that individuals are really<br />formed by their environment, of course.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.220" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">With humans that are niche creators do the<br />individuals effect their environment.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">Of course.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">If you hold either of those as the only perspective<br />obviously you’re just missing so much which</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:28.150" style="s2">is that the individual is affecting the whole.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.150" end="00:05:32.670" style="s2">The whole is, in turn affecting the individuals<br />and how do we create systems that have virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.670" end="00:05:36.919" style="s2">cycles between empowering individuals and<br />creating better social systems that have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.919" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">effect of creating humans that are not dependent<br />on the social systems but that are more sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.190" style="s2">and can, in turn, create better social systems.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.190" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2">And whether we’re thinking about a political<br />issue like that or we’re looking at a psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:55.320" style="s2">issue like the orientation of being and enjoying<br />reality as is and accepting ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.320" end="00:06:00.630" style="s2">others as is and doing and becoming which<br />is adding to life, adding to ourselves, seeking</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.630" end="00:06:01.900" style="s2">to improve ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.900" end="00:06:02.990" style="s2">How do we hold these together.</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.990" end="00:06:08.540" style="s2">They don’t just have to be held as paradox<br />or holding one or flip flopping.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.540" end="00:06:14.199" style="s2">There’s a way that when understanding how<br />they relate to each other – so in that example</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.199" end="00:06:19.740" style="s2">if I understand the nature of a person as<br />a noun that is static then it seems like accepting</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.740" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">them the way they are unconditionally, removes<br />the basis for growth.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:29.290" style="s2">But if I understand that the person is a dynamic<br />process, that they’re actually a verb that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.290" end="00:06:34.290" style="s2">intrinsic to what they are in the moment is<br />desire and impulse to grow and become.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.290" end="00:06:41.850" style="s2">And like that loving someone unconditionally<br />involves wanting for them their own self-actualization</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.850" end="00:06:47.220" style="s2">and there’s no dichotomy between accepting<br />someone ourselves as is or the world and seeking</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.220" end="00:06:49.970" style="s2">to help it grow, advance, express.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.970" end="00:06:55.389" style="s2">So it’s a very simple process of saying<br />the ability to take multiple perspectives,</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.389" end="00:06:59.979" style="s2">to see the partial truth in them and then<br />to be able to seam them together into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.979" end="00:07:01.389" style="s2">that isn’t a perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.389" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">It’s a trans perspective capacity to hold<br />the relationships between many perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:14.740" style="s2">in a way that can inform our choice-making<br />is fundamental to navigating reality.</p>
