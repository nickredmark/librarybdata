<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:23.550" style="s2">Gabrielle Adam Sweeney biblical names</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.000" end="00:00:26.189" style="s2">biblical names even got you know an Arch</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.189" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">like I like you&#39;ve been inspired by our</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">conversations about the Messiah haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">you probably probably but anything</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">anything big buckle I&#39;m into that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">mm-hmm that&#39;s very you know a biblical</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">Buddhist yeah we can&#39;t really locate</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">ourselves within Christianity to begin</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.250" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">with it&#39;s part of our history a heritage</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">but we&#39;re not Christians any longer so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">we have to go somewhere else to find</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">inspiration and for me that has been the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">Silk Route try it that&#39;s been the study</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">of Zoroastrianism Taoism and Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">and I find the whole worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">appears they&#39;re totally superior to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">begin with because it&#39;s monist and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">secondly because it&#39;s also much wiser</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:10.460" style="s2">it&#39;s much older so there&#39;s much more to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2">get from it mm-hmm yeah so the early</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.460" end="00:01:14.970" style="s2">Christianity is defined by its lacks</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.510" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s defined by what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.970" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">lacks and of course interesting enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">when we get to the 19th century and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">know the great Germans like Hegel and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">Nietzsche they all they all deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">negation or lack and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">you know typical Protestant reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">the inherent locks to Christianity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">begin with as opposed to plenitude and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">and fullness and whoa we arrived at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">20th century arrive at the cost we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">for separating Church of state in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">West and as John said the case that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">argued all along everything is religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">and if you try to pretend you do do</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:53.369" style="s2">something outside of religion you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">really dangerous territory that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.369" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">you end up with colonialism and Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">and Stalin which are of course the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">Heritage&#39;s of the west and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:04.380" style="s2">misunderstood that as you know a failure</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">of patriarchy when in reality it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.380" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">patchwork II that is not dictated the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">way a patriarchy should be which is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">should be part of a religion or it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">should be its own religion to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:15.390" style="s2">about so we left in math</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">turkey as a religion which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.390" end="00:02:19.320" style="s2">Christianity and we left with Patrick a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:21.720" style="s2">they were been celebrating a separate</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.320" end="00:02:23.580" style="s2">from religion as science and politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.720" end="00:02:26.100" style="s2">for example and that&#39;s exactly why</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.580" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">things have gone wrong hmm okay well we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.100" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">were today we were gonna talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">dialogue between David Chapman and genre</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">Vicki in regards to the film the Joker</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">yeah which I reacted to it and wrote</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">wrote a couple blog blogs on and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">it relates to what you&#39;re saying and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">was thinking this morning about about</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">the Joker figure and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">about his comparing him to let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">the figure of Satan and in Dante and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:58.520" style="s2">figure of Satan and Dante is is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">a caricature right he&#39;s he&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.520" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a letdown right he&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">monstrous figure and and and my insight</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">was that this Joker character is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of realism in him right</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s being he&#39;s being humanized and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">made more real and he has a backstory</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:17.850" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the film</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">yet have you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">I haven&#39;t been I know it really well</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">anyway the the film&#39;s a little different</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:25.860" style="s2">than the previous Joker films because</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">there&#39;s no supernatural element to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.860" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">right he&#39;s just he&#39;s just a guy and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:32.160" style="s2">it&#39;s different because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:34.200" style="s2">superheroes like there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.160" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">Batman and it&#39;s just about him right</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.200" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very clear it&#39;s human and he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:42.030" style="s2">ultimate narcissist and the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">tragedy and he has this sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.030" end="00:03:46.170" style="s2">he&#39;s as mental illness and all that kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">of thing and so the Joker</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.170" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">so I was thinking the Joker is alone as</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:54.510" style="s2">the Satan figure without any grand</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">narratives without without a superhero</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.510" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">you know I think you&#39;re missing an</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">important point with this specific but</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">it&#39;s called Joker not on the Joker and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:06.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">yeah so we can person if I am identified</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.300" end="00:04:11.640" style="s2">with him he&#39;s a very modern modern guy</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:13.890" style="s2">he&#39;s not the Joker and exactly so so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.640" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">whole the whole process of him coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.890" end="00:04:18.600" style="s2">out of the supernatural is what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">been thinking about and and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.600" end="00:04:22.620" style="s2">end of end of end of grand narratives</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:24.450" style="s2">and end of end of post and the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.620" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">of post-modernism and so he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.450" end="00:04:27.910" style="s2">figure as you say without without any</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:29.890" style="s2">religion except for chief</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.910" end="00:04:31.900" style="s2">entertainment and he lives with his</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.890" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">mother he&#39;s sort of a Jordan Peter</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.900" end="00:04:38.290" style="s2">Sounion kind of loser like the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:39.820" style="s2">never leaves home and and so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.290" end="00:04:42.130" style="s2">thought the film was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:46.120" style="s2">for its sort of inversion of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.130" end="00:04:49.300" style="s2">the typical Hollywood you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.120" end="00:04:51.490" style="s2">typical Joker myths right and also this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:53.140" style="s2">good versus evil duality which is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.490" end="00:04:55.210" style="s2">strong in in most of you know the good</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.140" end="00:04:57.310" style="s2">guy always wins but in this in this in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.210" end="00:04:59.920" style="s2">this film it&#39;s just this sort of bare</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.310" end="00:05:01.900" style="s2">realism and then and then he has this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.920" end="00:05:04.630" style="s2">kind of New Age enlightenment almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.900" end="00:05:06.370" style="s2">right he becomes he becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.630" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">enlightened in the negative sense it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.370" end="00:05:10.450" style="s2">becomes an egomaniac and the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.610" style="s2">tradition they called Rudra he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.450" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">he realizes that he has nothing to lose</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.610" end="00:05:17.260" style="s2">and and he can do anything he wants and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:22.170" style="s2">he becomes completely amoral and then he</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.260" end="00:05:25.390" style="s2">becomes a sort of terrorist right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.170" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">it&#39;s excellent material so the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.390" end="00:05:29.970" style="s2">one thing here please observe that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">assumption that the movie is based on</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.970" end="00:05:35.260" style="s2">its the fact that this guy is somebody</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">who&#39;s left religion behind and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.260" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">some kind of advancement or or necessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">so our basic arguments at so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">christen are using in our work is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.150" style="s2">the lack of religion is what&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:47.230" style="s2">this and there&#39;s no reason why there</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.150" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">should be a lack of religion in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.230" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">first place mmm-hmm we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:54.520" style="s2">accusing all the modern atheists or just</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">lacking imagination right that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.520" end="00:05:59.230" style="s2">synth ISM is called crepe in God in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:01.750" style="s2">Internet age we seriously mean exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.230" end="00:06:03.550" style="s2">that so if you want to have a god you</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.750" end="00:06:05.110" style="s2">need to create a God there you create</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.550" end="00:06:05.530" style="s2">the God that&#39;s what people have always</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.530" end="00:06:09.070" style="s2">that&#39;s how religion is formulated and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.180" end="00:06:11.590" style="s2">religion is then it contained there</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.220" end="00:06:29.380" style="s2">ology so no modalities the word we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:31.780" style="s2">using for an religion for the container</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.380" end="00:06:34.030" style="s2">for religion itself so we&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.780" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">in religion as religion we don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.030" end="00:06:37.210" style="s2">about in Pacific religion here we talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">about religion and its function in</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.210" end="00:06:41.150" style="s2">society this is why we have this saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.500" style="s2">everything is religion and if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.150" end="00:06:44.600" style="s2">tendus anything else then you end up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.500" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">with stupid religions like Nazism and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.600" end="00:06:48.470" style="s2">Stalinism in capitalism okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.580" end="00:06:52.850" style="s2">give us a good definition of religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.470" end="00:06:54.680" style="s2">then religion is what connects people to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.850" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">one another&#39;s as soon as there is some</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.680" end="00:06:58.940" style="s2">kind of communication between two or</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:01.730" style="s2">more human beings that has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.940" end="00:07:03.380" style="s2">within a religious container that means</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.730" end="00:07:06.410" style="s2">for example the individualism is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.380" end="00:07:07.460" style="s2">religion yeah believe in capitalism not</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.410" end="00:07:09.710" style="s2">the practice with the belief in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:11.690" style="s2">capitalism is a religion and and so is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.710" end="00:07:13.010" style="s2">also socialism and liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.690" end="00:07:14.600" style="s2">there are also religions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.010" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">different religious expressions they</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.600" end="00:07:19.370" style="s2">have to be understood as such as usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.780" end="00:07:21.920" style="s2">as bad religion because they don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.370" end="00:07:23.510" style="s2">so you have to go back and read the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.920" end="00:07:26.060" style="s2">formal religions are and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.510" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">we go back to the origin of the West the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.060" end="00:07:29.930" style="s2">separation of Europe and the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:32.210" style="s2">which is very important here and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.930" end="00:07:33.920" style="s2">starts in the fifth century and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.210" end="00:07:35.510" style="s2">leads to Islam dominating the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.920" end="00:07:38.090" style="s2">East and Christianity dominating the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.510" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">world the West but they&#39;re both Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.090" end="00:07:41.240" style="s2">religions and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:43.910" style="s2">Gnosticism is that because it&#39;s separate</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:46.310" style="s2">spirit and body he starts separating</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.910" end="00:07:48.530" style="s2">everything and the way we&#39;ve taken on</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.310" end="00:07:51.110" style="s2">Gnosticism in the West and celebrated it</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.530" end="00:07:53.660" style="s2">is by claiming that it was success for</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.110" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">us to separate church and state I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.660" end="00:07:58.970" style="s2">that was the big mistake mm-hmm okay and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.980" style="s2">that is a typically Christian phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.970" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">and why that happened was that in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.980" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">5th century we separate the two dominant</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">modes in the Roman Empire when they fell</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:06.710" style="s2">apart they were called Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:09.140" style="s2">Mithraism</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.710" end="00:08:10.700" style="s2">in Mithraism was the military religion</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.140" end="00:08:12.740" style="s2">so it&#39;s the religion that was phallic</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.700" end="00:08:14.390" style="s2">and Christianity served really well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.740" end="00:08:16.850" style="s2">the religion that celebrated the mother</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.390" end="00:08:18.200" style="s2">of the child the celebration of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.850" end="00:08:19.660" style="s2">mother and the child is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.200" end="00:08:22.850" style="s2">because it is our future</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.660" end="00:08:25.100" style="s2">you just had a son you had your your</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.850" end="00:08:27.980" style="s2">your woman gave birth to your son</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.100" end="00:08:29.780" style="s2">so she&#39;s the mother of your son the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.980" end="00:08:31.730" style="s2">that that happened means that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.780" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">future you have your future path I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.730" end="00:08:35.810" style="s2">have any biological children at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:38.060" style="s2">not officially so I don&#39;t have that path</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:39.380" style="s2">I can only share your path but I support</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.060" end="00:08:41.180" style="s2">your path but I don&#39;t have that path</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.380" end="00:08:43.010" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know children so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.180" end="00:08:44.840" style="s2">idea of mother and children being a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.010" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">religion in itself is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.840" end="00:08:48.920" style="s2">fundamental it&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:51.110" style="s2">religion Buddhism and Christianity have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.920" end="00:08:53.570" style="s2">those traits but you need to complement</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.110" end="00:08:54.830" style="s2">that Buddhism found that eventually at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.570" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">very high cost</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.830" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">Christianity still hasn&#39;t you need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.690" end="00:09:00.650" style="s2">complement that with the phallic</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:04.580" style="s2">religion this is why we call Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.650" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">Peterson surge towards reintroducing</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.580" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">religion into our thinking we call that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:08.870" style="s2">phallic and therefore we call him his or</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.090" style="s2">aster</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.870" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">so this is the phallic mission that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.090" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">West desperately needs mm-hmm we needed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:19.070" style="s2">we needed phallic religion again so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.660" style="s2">we can contain things like politics and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.070" end="00:09:23.420" style="s2">the military and all those things within</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.660" end="00:09:25.310" style="s2">the religious container okay so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.420" end="00:09:28.280" style="s2">can I go back to the Joker film a little</p>

<p begin="00:10:10.040" end="00:10:14.870" style="s2">a position he has to have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.990" end="00:10:17.060" style="s2">interesting okay so the predicament here</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">I said he actually built into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.060" end="00:10:22.400" style="s2">assumptions of the script itself mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">this is what he said guy who&#39;s lost his</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.960" end="00:10:42.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know whatever it was that started</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.430" end="00:10:44.180" style="s2">in the 1960s where you didn&#39;t need a sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.710" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t need a religion and you</p>

<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:52.070" style="s2">and you know you just want to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:54.200" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s kind of a American</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.070" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">individualism and that is very much a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.200" end="00:11:00.020" style="s2">religion okay we&#39;re all alone we&#39;re all</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.670" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t have a life here and</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.850" end="00:11:59.720" style="s2">women and children then it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.040" end="00:12:02.839" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.649" end="00:12:10.550" style="s2">exactly so you if you only have</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.449" end="00:12:12.680" style="s2">Christianity or possibly Buddhism as the</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.680" end="00:12:17.569" style="s2">the religion of mother and child so like</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:20.209" style="s2">that would be the only religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.569" end="00:12:22.579" style="s2">exactly what Joker ends up with some</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.209" end="00:12:24.740" style="s2">kind of New Age enlightenment where he</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.579" end="00:12:26.509" style="s2">has a man can only do one thing and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.740" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">is to plunder the world that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.509" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">precisely my point if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.490" style="s2">history of the West the last 1600s after</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.319" style="s2">Christianity became our only official</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.490" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">religion in the West and we got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.319" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">the military religion and we left the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.970" style="s2">phallic energy you know the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:46.040" style="s2">wanting to get higher and improve on</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.970" end="00:12:48.319" style="s2">something and make it better we left</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.040" end="00:12:50.029" style="s2">that to this state so we left it to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.319" end="00:12:52.339" style="s2">military and we left it to the new arena</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.029" end="00:12:55.129" style="s2">called politics that&#39;s we put all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.339" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">men this is what feminism is wrongly</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.129" end="00:13:00.949" style="s2">accused of being patriarchy no it is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">misdirected patriarchy we have to patch</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.949" end="00:13:04.550" style="s2">our key and we have to matter ok we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">always argued in our work that you need</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.550" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">both ok but the pack turkeys misdirected</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">so what would men do if they do not have</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">a religion that contained their phallic</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:18.529" style="s2">energy that applies wisdom to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.600" style="s2">phallic energy it just operates on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.529" end="00:13:22.460" style="s2">favourtie calls the level of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.600" end="00:13:24.770" style="s2">intelligence but without rationality</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.460" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">mmm-hmm it would become Joker right they</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.770" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">would even become what the West became</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">it would become a system like colonizes</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.490" end="00:13:37.670" style="s2">and then plunders the world mm-hmm it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:40.040" style="s2">becomes a state a permanent exploitation</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.670" end="00:13:41.959" style="s2">yeah except the Joker as the Joker&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.040" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">late capitalism in it comes at the end</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.959" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">of all that right he&#39;s the late</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:47.870" style="s2">capitalist yeah doctor we&#39;re all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:51.290" style="s2">left is entertainment and what you would</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.870" end="00:13:55.700" style="s2">call more Tito or you know yes driver</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:57.320" style="s2">for for narcissistic drive for pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.700" end="00:13:59.720" style="s2">and destruction or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.320" end="00:14:02.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what yeah it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.720" end="00:14:04.520" style="s2">vulgar Nietzschean ism in this in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.450" end="00:14:06.830" style="s2">shape you&#39;ve seen it of the past 30 or</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.520" end="00:14:08.870" style="s2">40 years so late last year and other</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.830" end="00:14:11.209" style="s2">thinkers have gone into the cynical mood</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.870" end="00:14:13.490" style="s2">saying that there&#39;s no hope for us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.209" end="00:14:15.320" style="s2">left with this religion called</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.490" end="00:14:17.570" style="s2">individualism we&#39;re left with the cart</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.320" end="00:14:19.220" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing beyond that and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.570" end="00:14:21.649" style="s2">can even critique Nietzsche for never</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.220" end="00:14:23.300" style="s2">understanding that aristocrat that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.649" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">celebrates the ubermensch has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.300" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">kind of a collective that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:29.570" style="s2">bringing Marx back into the picture okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.670" style="s2">through Marx proletariat that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.570" end="00:14:34.070" style="s2">actually have a client or a tribe all</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.670" end="00:14:36.290" style="s2">men who can operate together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.070" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">what religion should have done so if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.290" end="00:14:41.450" style="s2">bring religion to Nietzsche&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">you will start getting things right we</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.450" end="00:14:45.020" style="s2">have to understand the phallic energy as</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:48.350" style="s2">something that needs to be controlled</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.020" end="00:14:51.290" style="s2">and contained within a religion phallic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.350" end="00:14:54.709" style="s2">religion is a response to that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.290" end="00:14:57.380" style="s2">in yeah you talked about Marx last time</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.709" end="00:15:00.200" style="s2">and also Nietzsche and you also talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.380" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">about them being heroic so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.200" end="00:15:04.610" style="s2">other thought I then thought I had is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.120" end="00:15:07.730" style="s2">that the Joker is sort of the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.610" end="00:15:10.820" style="s2">the heroic heroic that&#39;s any sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.730" end="00:15:13.970" style="s2">and and again we have this discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.820" end="00:15:16.310" style="s2">about how how everybody&#39;s very reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.970" end="00:15:18.740" style="s2">to to go into the heroic because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.310" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">afraid of totalitarianism and all that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.740" end="00:15:24.050" style="s2">but we want we want he want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:27.110" style="s2">back the heroic in some sense so in what</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.050" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">sense well the alternative to the heroic</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.110" end="00:15:32.750" style="s2">is Joker the whole time to the rock is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:34.140" style="s2">cynical manipulator and exploiter what</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.750" end="00:15:36.779" style="s2">else would it be</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.140" end="00:15:39.000" style="s2">if you take a young man and you put him</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.779" end="00:15:40.890" style="s2">forward toward in front of the elderly</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.000" end="00:15:42.450" style="s2">what would they do with him they put him</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.890" end="00:15:44.670" style="s2">through the initiation ritual to knock</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.450" end="00:15:45.899" style="s2">his ego out and then make him serve the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.670" end="00:15:48.269" style="s2">communities his life can become</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.899" end="00:15:50.190" style="s2">meaningless this is the shift from me</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.269" end="00:15:53.399" style="s2">from me Chinese into Marxism in a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.190" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">way that that means you need to serve</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.399" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">your community and if you don&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:15:59.579" style="s2">role you serve the community you&#39;re lost</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">Joker has those it&#39;s ro why because</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.579" end="00:16:05.010" style="s2">religion is the one thing that supplies</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:07.140" style="s2">the role within that community so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.010" end="00:16:09.029" style="s2">the ultimate religious ritual is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.140" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">initiation ritual of the young man and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.029" end="00:16:14.850" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t acknowledges that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:16.589" style="s2">there to serve the community and because</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.850" end="00:16:18.420" style="s2">if he serves the community he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.589" end="00:16:20.459" style="s2">serve his own ego he gets out of his</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.420" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2">imprisonment and he can then be set free</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.459" end="00:16:24.870" style="s2">to serve the community which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.200" end="00:16:26.700" style="s2">purpose of the Falak religion this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.870" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2">called transcendence yeah it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.700" end="00:16:31.320" style="s2">interesting yeah because in the film I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:34.820" style="s2">just let me just in the film he he has</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.320" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">this this is a spoiler but he has this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.820" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">he funds he&#39;s not his mother is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:41.399" style="s2">really his mother and let&#39;s say his</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:43.410" style="s2">father figure is not really his father</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.399" end="00:16:44.940" style="s2">and he kills them both right so he kills</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.410" end="00:16:47.699" style="s2">the mother and the father so he kills</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.940" end="00:16:50.670" style="s2">both the matriarch and the patriarchy in</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.699" end="00:16:52.829" style="s2">a certain sense but he kills them</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.670" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">because they failed to be match our kin</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.829" end="00:16:56.339" style="s2">patriarch because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:59.940" style="s2">religion within which they can act the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.339" end="00:17:02.490" style="s2">roles attract in a metric yeah the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.940" end="00:17:04.110" style="s2">he kills in he has fake name a jerk in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.490" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">the fake patriarchy and so he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.110" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">enacting the the dis archetype when when</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not working or when when the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:12.929" style="s2">thing isn&#39;t working well he has he has</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:14.579" style="s2">inherited the worldview from them and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.929" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">the world is inherited is that life is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.579" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">certainly meaningless Joker is born into</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:22.380" style="s2">a world without religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:24.419" style="s2">a world without religion for men at</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.380" end="00:17:26.010" style="s2">least the only remnant of religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.419" end="00:17:28.049" style="s2">that&#39;s left is the religion - celebrates</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.010" end="00:17:30.660" style="s2">mother and child so his own upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.049" end="00:17:32.309" style="s2">he said he leaves religion because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.660" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">tight his childhood and as soon as it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.309" end="00:17:36.809" style="s2">becomes an adult is thrown into a world</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:39.419" style="s2">where ironically the only religion that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.809" end="00:17:41.429" style="s2">exists American individualism in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.419" end="00:17:42.750" style="s2">American individualism has preached for</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.429" end="00:17:43.980" style="s2">the past three or four hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.750" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">that you you&#39;re on your own</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.980" end="00:17:48.120" style="s2">all you can do is to try to colonize and</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.120" end="00:17:55.170" style="s2">possibly can well that was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">Bret Easton Ellis in the 1980s to begin</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.170" end="00:17:58.440" style="s2">with so this is just like the follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:00.300" style="s2">of that this is like the mass version of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.440" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">America but I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get the</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.030" end="00:18:55.530" style="s2">because you can exploit something you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.460" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">would just you know burn the candle in</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:06.990" style="s2">has to end you have to have an attitude</p>

<p begin="00:19:56.010" end="00:20:00.420" style="s2">statement right it means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.560" end="00:20:01.270" style="s2">nothing for us to find on Mars and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.420" end="00:20:03.850" style="s2">nothing for us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.270" end="00:20:06.790" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just endless expansion into</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.850" end="00:20:08.800" style="s2">into you know into nothingness sir there</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.790" end="00:20:11.140" style="s2">is nowhere to go and he&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.800" end="00:20:14.260" style="s2">expensive and it&#39;s just cold and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.140" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">nothing there no you know the moon</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.260" end="00:20:19.300" style="s2">landing was a disaster we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:21.850" style="s2">returned what was the moon a damn rock</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:23.620" style="s2">full of radiation and cold like hell why</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.850" end="00:20:25.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t you go used to Siberia because</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.620" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">nobody&#39;s left in Siberia territory</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.960" end="00:20:31.150" style="s2">something we have abundance of territory</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:33.880" style="s2">and you said that before telling us</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.150" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">Ellen must should go to Siberia right</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.880" end="00:20:39.850" style="s2">instead of instead of Mars it is warmer</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:41.560" style="s2">it is closer far less expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.850" end="00:20:43.420" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody there well all those</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.560" end="00:20:45.130" style="s2">resources yeah I mean obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.420" end="00:20:47.500" style="s2">should direct them on to it to our own</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.130" end="00:20:49.780" style="s2">planet it seems ok so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.500" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">implication tells you implication to us</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.780" end="00:20:53.890" style="s2">you got a resource in front of you not</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:55.750" style="s2">why don&#39;t you use it in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.890" end="00:20:58.180" style="s2">actually replace it as soon as you use</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.750" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">it so we do that for example with water</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.180" end="00:21:03.070" style="s2">we have to do with energy we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:05.140" style="s2">with anything that is a flow of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.070" end="00:21:07.660" style="s2">in our society to create the Bundys</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.140" end="00:21:10.260" style="s2">that&#39;s needed this turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.660" end="00:21:14.200" style="s2">perfect project for a phallic energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.260" end="00:21:15.790" style="s2">mm-hmm right okay so all the engineers</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.200" end="00:21:17.500" style="s2">of the world need to be united the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.790" end="00:21:19.150" style="s2">engineers of the world have to define</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.500" end="00:21:21.490" style="s2">themselves as the proper Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.150" end="00:21:21.850" style="s2">proletariat they need to take over the</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.850" end="00:21:25.420" style="s2">and they need to do it with an</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.080" end="00:21:26.980" style="s2">employment of spirit which is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.420" end="00:21:28.870" style="s2">gonna stay on this planet we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.980" end="00:21:30.580" style="s2">cultivate all of this planet and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.870" end="00:21:32.500" style="s2">going to essentially create a Garden of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.580" end="00:21:35.050" style="s2">Babel instead of a Tower of Babel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.500" end="00:21:36.790" style="s2">gonna be planet Earth well this planet</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.050" end="00:21:39.910" style="s2">Earth we can then live on this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.790" end="00:21:42.160" style="s2">idea of appropriate the garden of gobble</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.910" end="00:21:44.560" style="s2">the garden about and this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.160" end="00:21:47.260" style="s2">engineer&#39;s the future Chief James would</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.560" end="00:21:48.730" style="s2">do the future priests who then have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.260" end="00:21:51.130" style="s2">commercial itself and something we call</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.730" end="00:21:52.630" style="s2">cosmopolitanism which is to build the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.130" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">machine intelligence that helps people</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.630" end="00:21:59.560" style="s2">to love the stranger you see how utopian</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:01.210" style="s2">these visions are they&#39;re all built on</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.560" end="00:22:03.820" style="s2">the idea that we couldn&#39;t spark or</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.210" end="00:22:05.650" style="s2">religion that works and if you construct</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.820" end="00:22:07.660" style="s2">the phallic religion that works then we</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.650" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">can pretty much leave the market</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.660" end="00:22:11.020" style="s2">religion to Buddhism Christianity a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:13.420" style="s2">age whatever you want to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.020" end="00:22:14.590" style="s2">we have those religions already we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.420" end="00:22:16.150" style="s2">save them in that sense the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.590" end="00:22:17.860" style="s2">cuz there&#39;s something that complements</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.150" end="00:22:19.480" style="s2">them so my response too young for</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.860" end="00:22:21.400" style="s2">Varrick is that he&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.480" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">about everything in his Buddhism but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.400" end="00:22:26.679" style="s2">he&#39;s only half before mm-hmm as a Joan</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.600" style="s2">of Arc is not getting a large following</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.679" end="00:22:30.100" style="s2">a young men who are like oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.600" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">young for Varrick is the shape we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.100" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">gonna follow him Jordan Peters and did</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">and we increasingly are too so if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:40.900" style="s2">speak directly to men about phallic</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">energy you need for a fire collision in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.900" end="00:22:49.630" style="s2">our society you there like our picture</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:51.960" style="s2">yes of course which is meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.630" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">it&#39;s meaningful because it is a religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.960" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:59.049" style="s2">cynical atheistic exercise okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:23:01.929" style="s2">I&#39;m a bit stuck on this thing everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.049" end="00:23:03.220" style="s2">is religion because you could if you you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.929" end="00:23:05.049" style="s2">could almost say anything you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.220" end="00:23:08.380" style="s2">if everything is a religion then nothing</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.350" end="00:25:21.380" style="s2">everything is one but it has many many</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:23.060" style="s2">everyone it doesn&#39;t mean Spinoza said</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:58.700" style="s2">critique of monism that I&#39;ve heard would</p>
