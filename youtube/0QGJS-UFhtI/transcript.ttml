<p begin="00:00:11.459" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">proliferating and the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:18.990" style="s2">getting access to it is going down so</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">that arc is a very bad are your side of</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.640" end="00:00:28.200" style="s2">going there is that there&#39;s a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.260" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">image yeah that these same powers can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.200" end="00:00:32.879" style="s2">used for good yes the difference I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">right now is that up until recently they</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.879" end="00:00:38.249" style="s2">could be used for good now they must be</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">used for good yes which is which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.249" end="00:00:42.839" style="s2">in kind of an imperative for us to</p>
