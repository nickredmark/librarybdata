<p begin="00:00:51.280" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">i heard about your book and i think it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">was from probably your publicist</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:00:59.199" style="s2">actually and i checked it out and i said</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">hell yes this is a theme that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.199" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">talked about here on the show before</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:04.720" style="s2">we had uh zach stein on actually for</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:06.400" style="s2">three episodes</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">he wrote the preface to the book yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">saw that good job that he did</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting guy</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:14.000" style="s2">this is a different take i would say in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">many ways a more tangible take</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.000" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">on envisioning what a new education for</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">the modern age might look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:22.400" style="s2">you know the book is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">you must have done a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.400" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">of research on it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">because you recapitulate the history and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">mechanics of debt and money</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">the rise and fall of economic paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">the history of technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">the obsolescence of econ 101</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">sense making and lots more of the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">of things that we talk about on the show</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">but mostly not exclusively mostly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">going to focus today</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:48.159" style="s2">on your ideas of building an entirely</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">new educational infrastructure in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.159" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">better to say an educational ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">now of course we&#39;ll refer back to some</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">of that earlier material in the book and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">i do recommend it to listeners as a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">and clear and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">commonsensical and that&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">presentation of many of the ideas we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">talk about on the show</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">absolutely thank you and as usual we</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">grandparents and i was still doing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">consulting thing so i could do that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">working for</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">new york offices doing the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">i.t infrastructure consulting</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">and then suddenly became a high school</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">physics teacher robotics teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">then high school principal</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">i needed to go the private sector route</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">to prove some things to myself i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">and when i got that big job offer that i</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">was waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:27.599" style="s2">i suddenly didn&#39;t say no i didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">yes and that surprised me it took me a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.599" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">few weeks to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">figure out that i just needed that offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">i actually didn&#39;t want that job</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:35.200" style="s2">i like to work really hard and i like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">complicated things</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.200" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">and so doing that to make money i felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">like i&#39;d get resentful at some point but</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">doing that for high school kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">i just couldn&#39;t imagine ever resenting</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">working hard for that so it made sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">to go there</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">earlier in my career before i went too</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">deep and so then i ended up here</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">really amazing uh amazing story really a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">gutsy move i mean how many people at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">relatively young age</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">turn down the career track right the big</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">bucks glory maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">maybe not for a truly fulfilling and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">moderately uh big city teachers are paid</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">pretty good these days</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:12.080" style="s2">a moderate lifestyle but certainly no</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">glory shall we say at least to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">external world i really commend you for</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">that decision it was a selfish decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">right it was for myself but yeah here i</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">hear what you&#39;re saying from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">it might look</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">altruistic but it really is for my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">quality of life of course in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">nobody&#39;s actually an altruist right</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">i think we actually all know that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">just have to understand what people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">motivations</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">actually are right seldom do people</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">actually work against their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">and then you worked your way up from</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">school teacher to principal and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:42.080" style="s2">into a pretty uh tough school in harlem</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">it had low rankings</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.080" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">and over a period of years you moved the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">rankings from the bottom to the top how</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">did you do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">so my staff did that i really believe as</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">a principal as a school leader in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">school the teachers who have contact</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">with the young people are the leaders</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">and so first step was leadership support</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">and learning from my staff</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">and learning from the right staff my art</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">teacher was kind of my main go-to person</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">for all professional development because</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">kind of that entry</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">i understood that the complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">comes with interpreting a piece of art</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">was the kind of thinking that i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">the kids to be doing so it was a focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">on looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">is critical thinking and i had for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">long time actually since the late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">been looking at decentralized media i</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">had started a podcasting non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">before podcasting was known as such we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:25.680" style="s2">still distributed on cd magazines</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">because the internet couldn&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.680" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">audio yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">and so i kind of was lucky to come into</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">education with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">software engineering background and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:37.919" style="s2">the media savvy and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">that idea of having high quality student</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.919" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">work products</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">in the form of media you know podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">or videos and focusing on just</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">generating really high quality content</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">generated by the students</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:50.160" style="s2">that led to seven year journey but what</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">was surprising for us nobody expected</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.160" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">our data to be that strong because the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">is based on standardized tests mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t focusing on those my risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">the risk that i took and i knew i could</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">get a job back in technology so i knew i</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">could take the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">take the risk and get fired but i took a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">risk of kind of not focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">standardized exams and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">within 18 months we were we went from an</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">f school</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">on a shutdown list persistent low</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">achieving school need of improving all</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">acronyms they step on you and all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">state intervention teams and auditors</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">all over crawling around the building</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re about to get shut down</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">within 18 months we were a b-school in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">school and maintained that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">top ranking for you know seven years so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">that surprised me i had seen a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.199" style="s2">with my robotics team when i brought in</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">media and we um we made a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.199" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">somebody made a documentary about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of executive function</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">of self-reflection that happens when</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">somebody&#39;s making a documentary about</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">that i just brought into individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">students lives um and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">i&#39;d say about that is i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">data-driven</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">but i you know data is like a menu right</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">you don&#39;t need the menu</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">so the data would just let me know which</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">students to go talk to when</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">and about what but it wasn&#39;t the um</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">that played a big role in our success i</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">think but it uh you know so for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">look to see changes in student</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">performance and so if a student&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">attendance went down or the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">the assignment they get at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">of class they do now if suddenly they</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">were always doing well on those suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">that dropped off</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">i knew something had changed and i would</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">just ask them what change you know just</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">pull them into office privately</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">one-on-one and say hey what what</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">happened or have a counselor do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">and conversely you could have a student</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">that&#39;s failing all their classes you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">and one week they&#39;re passing all of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">if you just look at aggregate statistics</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">the school they&#39;re still failing all</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">their classes but if you can get that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:29.520" style="s2">change for that week you can go grab</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">them in the halls and say what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.520" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">happened you passed all your classes</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">this week</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no official grades there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">report cards but that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">high it&#39;s kind of a high frequency</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">more than most schools that just give</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">you data at the very end of the term</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">after you know months of learning we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">looked at gating data earlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">so that we could intervene on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">of acknowledging students and supporting</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">that sounds like the way it ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">and unfortunately oftentimes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">what&#39;s the name of the documentary by</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">the way maybe talk just a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:00.879" style="s2">about that robotics team does that seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">to me a pretty interesting story</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.879" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">yeah i can send you a link to it it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">youtube now it was called the g house</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">pirates</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">which was the name of the team cool and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">basically they went from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.479" style="s2">school that nobody would expect to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">well in such a competition to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.479" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">top teams right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">we were the first all-minority team to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">compete nationally we beat all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">private schools and public schools but</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">right all the private schools included</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">we beat in</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">new york city second place in new york</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">state um and that includes you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">rochester</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">like these massive teams that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">massive industry behind them um</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">and we were able to take them down just</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">with brute force i mean for the six</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">we had six weeks to build the robot this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">you know five foot tall</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">120 pound monster and we i lived at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">during those six weeks i you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">not not supposed to tell anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">we&#39;re not supposed to stay overnight at</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">the school but we i had a cot in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">we would work through the night for six</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">weeks i did not and i didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">family back then so i could do those</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">crazy things but</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">that&#39;s how we pulled it off is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">brute force you and i both know</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.519" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s perspiration not inspiration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">the answer it was that thomas edison i</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">think said that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember how many times it</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">appeared in your book but the word work</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">ethic is a word you use a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">yeah and people you know across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">political spectrum agree that</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of uh we&#39;re losing it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">um because screens are sucking our</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">attention and we don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">handing over value to the screen instead</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">of using the screen</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">to support us to you know meet the goals</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">that we&#39;re setting for ourselves which</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">is a true digital native i think would</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">that is a weak muscle among our people</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">hardcore stuff like talking to a guy who</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">and i think that what you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">about drug</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">use you know legal or illegal i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">everybody&#39;s drugged up because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.519" style="s2">have that work ethic actually working</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">hard and the rewards the psychoactive</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">things um is what those drugs are</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">filling in for i think i think there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">and without that i think we all you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">everybody&#39;s medicating themselves in one</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">way or another</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">yeah and then attention to detail also</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">you know the essence of our current</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">economy as you go into in the book is</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">attention hijacking we&#39;ll get to that a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">so we have a school system and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">dedicated and perhaps wild and crazy</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">principles sometimes you can make it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:13.839" style="s2">work for the kids</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">but everything we read says that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.839" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">particularly for the more deprived kids</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">it ain&#39;t working so well and i would</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">tell you looking at the kids even in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">middle class and upper middle class</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">schools maybe it works sort of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">but at extremely high cost</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.000" end="00:11:30.079" style="s2">to their well-being i mean i look back</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">at the college entrance</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.079" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">craziness that goes on these days you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">know i was in college i filled out a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">couple apps threw them over the transom</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">and you saw what happened didn&#39;t sweat</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">it right</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">and that was that like i applied to two</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">colleges got into both of them picked</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">one that was that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">now oh my god and so there&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">a significant</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">mismatch between our educational called</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">public school system and those private</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">schools that more or less emulate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">public schools</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">not all of them but many of them we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">have some alternatives like the waldorf</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.200" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">schools etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">but talk a little bit about the mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">educational industrial complex and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">our economy really needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">right so 1843 horace mann brings johann</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">gottlieb</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">fiesta&#39;s ideas right into the us and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s this industrial</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">idea of you know kind of taking the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">ideas from industrial production and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">bringing them into human thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">1892 they pulled together a committee of</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">10 they designed the high school as we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">know it today</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">and what you&#39;re pointing out is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">we&#39;re in an educational system that</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">it has existed since then at least right</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">this industrial model</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">and since then the digital age has taken</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">hold and decentralization is happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">and so the mismatch is one um you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">or thinking about your purpose or</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">thinking creatively or solving difficult</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">problems is not what you needed factory</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">workers to be doing with their time</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">and the the industrial model of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">education was brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">for what it was designed to do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:59.200" style="s2">outlived its usefulness because it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">so effective it&#39;s hard to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">because it was such an effective tool</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">to increase literacy and numeracy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">it had a lot of other impacts i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">that were really positive but today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">outlived its usefulness and we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">in a world that&#39;s still run by those</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the big context now</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">getting into some of the details</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">the system right now is top down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">based it&#39;s coercive</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">right it forces you to sit in and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">thinking about high school that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">area of expertise i think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">different you mentioned waldorf schools</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">i grew up in the waldorf schools in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">elementary but i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">different beast</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">for high school where you sit in a room</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">bell rings and you go to another subject</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">that&#39;s all the industrial bells and</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">not useful anymore and our kids know it</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">apart in the same way because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">too big to fail in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">and so the transition is going to be one</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">you know rebuilding it while we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">flight and so it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">different of a process but</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the same pressures of inversion</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">that are happening in industry</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">as are happening in our high schools</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">yeah truthfully this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">sense of mismatch has been going on for</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">quite a while i&#39;m a bit of an old stir i</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">went to high school in the late</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">60s and even then we had the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">well yeah you hop through the hoops and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">you know get the reward go to a good</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">college if you did go to college i</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">actually went to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">working class high school where only 20</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">of the people went on to a four-year</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">college</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">even then we felt that there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">something wrong with the sausage factory</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">as we sometimes call it that it was not</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">humane use for human beings and as i was</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">reading in your book</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">you know i really came away resonating</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">saying hmm this would have been a hell</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">of a lot more fun</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">in addition to being a better</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">alone the world of 2021.</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">maybe talk a little bit about that soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">suck</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">that the sausage factory has as one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">its side products</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">right so the main engine that drove the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">economy and our high schools were</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">designed to prepare kids for this engine</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">make stuff so we can create jobs so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">have people buy more stuff so that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">can have more jobs right that was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">loop that ran everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">um and so we were trained in high school</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:45.120" style="s2">to be consumers</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">and that includes consumers of how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.120" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">think right from the textbooks and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">standardization of thinking in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">standardized tests</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">today to make money you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">producer of content right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">get an audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">you have to have people follow you and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">then that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">audience is what starts generating money</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">in a digital economy that attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">so there&#39;s it&#39;s just a very different</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">way to think because the old industrial</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">model was based on things like fossil</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">fuels where it was zero sum i have it or</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">you have it we can&#39;t both have it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">but information in an information age or</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">an ideas economy you want things to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">get copied and spread the more somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">spreads your tweet the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">social capital you gain so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">collaborative positive sum dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:30.800" style="s2">and that change from a top-down coercive</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">system to a bottom-up collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.800" end="00:16:33.759" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">it can&#39;t be gradual the classroom when</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.759" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">you walk into classroom when i walk into</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">i can see the ones that are bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">where the students are generating the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">where it&#39;s their genius that&#39;s at you</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">know on display and then you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">ones where it&#39;s the teachers genius on</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">display and the students are there</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">told to mimic and regurgitate it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">flip right it&#39;s a switch it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not a fader and so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">where we see ourselves right now i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">at with covet in particular</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">we&#39;re hitting a breaking point where um</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">we&#39;re either gonna have to flip the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">switch or our schools are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">just completely fall apart no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">going to go to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">yep it&#39;s an opportunity right it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">opportunity to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">a change that was likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">someday i think the same applies for</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">instance to business travel</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">for at least 10 years i&#39;ve been telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">people why you need to fly around the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">country for a one hour meeting spend two</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">thousand dollars in three days</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">when zoom or earlier skype would work</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">almost as good</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">maybe better instead of spending an hour</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">spend two hours on the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">and i believe covid has thrown a shock</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">to that basin of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">of high-end business travel high and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">medium and business travel</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">and i suspect it&#39;ll never go back it may</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">well be that the same will happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">with education that&#39;s right it may or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">may not i hope it does and i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">you&#39;re right that this is an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">because people&#39;s minds are open</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve been doing this work with media in</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">high schools since 2003 so you know 17</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">and all of a sudden people are willing</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">right and wondering what the brand of</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">regurgitate is for that test flipping</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">students producing quality work and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">focusing on that student content</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">i grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">the uh vocational tech i was a physics</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">teacher and the robotics teacher at a</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">um with your hands is is what education</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">has to look like i</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">completely agree with you and so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">system that i&#39;m designing allows</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">teachers vocational teachers robotics</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">teachers in particular i&#39;ve obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">thought a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">them as i designed this allows them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:51.679" style="s2">create a credit</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">the system decentralizes the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.679" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">credit so anybody can make a credit</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">and they can make a credit that&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">on those real world experiences and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">think you&#39;re right that we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">out of their devices into the real world</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">to interact with it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not about getting them you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">their attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">into some app that&#39;s capturing their</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">attention we talked before a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">about the old industrial loop that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">you get more jobs by producing more</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">stuff so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">you know get more jobs because they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">to produce more stuff the new cycle that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">i talk about in the book</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">is you create something you share it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">data right and that cycle people um you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">whether you&#39;re building chairs for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">living or highways</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">or podcasts it&#39;s still a similar cycle</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">of creation and sharing and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">getting data back and so that is what i</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">want students to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">and i agree with you i want the credits</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">on the system to be ones that ask you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">go out into the world and to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">wood shop and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">work with your hands and take apart</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">machinery like be curious about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">world and interact with your world</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">socially physically for the different</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">disciplines that you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine how a physics credit</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">could ever</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">keep you in a screen there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">study physics with a screen</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">right you need to get out and you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">bounce a ball throw you know make a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">pendulum whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">and similarly with chemistry but i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:14.080" style="s2">that you can do a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">and capture your work in instead of uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.080" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">you know scientist journal that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">used to do on paper you can do it as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">podcast just pick up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">speak a little bit and then edit it</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">together at the end it&#39;s the piece of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">the audio or video</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">just adds a piece of reflection so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">you want to have an intern at any</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">you could use this system for to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">interns as high school students</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">and they just the podcasting just gives</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">a way to reflect over the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">experience and at the end wrap up and do</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">a reflection and that reflective piece</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:40.240" style="s2">is important to learning that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:40.880" style="s2">metacognitive piece is important to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.240" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.880" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">and so i think it always benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">having the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why i got that data in the school</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">to move so quickly because</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">students were being recorded and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">could then hear what they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">said there&#39;s something in that process</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">of recording and listening and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">thinking about and recording again and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">journaling it&#39;s like keeping a journal</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">that process can always support any work</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">that you do but i totally agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">if this has kids end up in the screens</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">more we have failed</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">indeed you also and enough to tie back</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">this to actual world projects</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">you have actually quite eloquent one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">the better discussions i&#39;ve ever read</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">about crowd funding and how it&#39;s a pull</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">model rather than a push</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">model for creation right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">this more or less ripping off your</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">rhetoric here so this isn&#39;t my idea this</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">is yours</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">you know the traditional big industrial</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">corporation you know designs a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">new widget that makes life a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">easier sells it for a while and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">sales start going down so they come out</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">with the new and improved version</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">and push it out into the world if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">proctor and gamble you spend</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">two billion dollars a year on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">advertising for new and improved tide</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">and many other products which haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">changed really in any fundamental way in</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">50 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">while crowdfunding is very much the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">opposite right you have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">you put it out there and if people</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">resonate with it and pre-commit</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">then you build it right quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">interesting and it would seem to me that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">in this model of encouraging the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">high school age kid to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">world crowd funding could be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.440" style="s2">remarkable way</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">first they have to learn the technique</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.440" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to have them use it</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">on real bullets on the very first one</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">but maybe the second one they may</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">put up a crowd funding proposal that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">they&#39;re prepared to execute upon</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">should it actually gather some attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">absolutely and so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">model of the crowd intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">driving the work rather than a ceo at</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">the top deciding</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">you know what&#39;s going to happen um map</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">that onto a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">right it fits perfectly the old the ceo</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">was the model of the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">that would tell the students they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">be the manager of the classroom and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">would do a lot of classroom management</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">and it was all about controlling</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:49.919" style="s2">coercing and warehousing our young</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.919" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">and increasingly the more they</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">understand that what they&#39;re learning is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">irrelevant the more we have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">focus on coercion to keep them in those</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.279" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">here with these credits</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">if the students are the ones creating</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">the content that that is the</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">project a great project is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">crowdsource model in the business sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">where you put out an idea and try to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">it pre-funded</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">whether they succeed or fail they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">learn a ton from that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:25.440" style="s2">the model itself of crowdsourcing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">information and all i&#39;m saying with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.440" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">digital media</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">going back to what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">before the role of recording your</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">with audio or with video i think audio</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">is more intimate again and easier</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">but if you record the process with audio</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">that becomes the accountability for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">teacher so you can be out in the field</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">doing the work and the accountability</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">for the teacher instead of asking you to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:45.679" style="s2">take an exam at the end the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">knows did you do anything they need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.679" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">know did you do anything what did you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">and so editing the audio and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">your process back with the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">in a podcast format would be how the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">teacher evaluates</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:57.200" style="s2">your work because they weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">with you they don&#39;t have to be there</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.200" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">with you when you&#39;re in 11th and 12th</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">grade you should be out</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">learning on your own and so the i</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">totally agree that mapping that is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">key innovation here is mapping that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">crowdsourcing model</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">into classrooms in high school</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">one last question before we get down</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">into the nitty-gritty of your dna</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">system proposal as i said i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">involved with the online world since</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">literally the beginning been involved</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">with many companies</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">either as an employee or an advisor an</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">investor and one thing has held</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">remarkably true</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">over the last 40 years which is in</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">online platforms approximately two</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">percent of the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">provide fifty percent of the content</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">two percent provide fifty percent and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">say is it a reasonable expectation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">you can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">a large percentage of the kids to become</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">creators</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">on essentially a similar level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">productivity you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">what was it once a month right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s only a small percentage that have</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">the right set</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">of emotional mental drive</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">characteristics that allow them to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">high quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">relatively high volume producers is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">reasonable that we can all become such</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">yeah i think in high school it is in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">universities when you when you want a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to you know if we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">just asking them to spontaneously do</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">this on the united say hey you know hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">let&#39;s have you do some academic skill</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">test building</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">i don&#39;t think any kid will do that um</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">but they have to because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">so we kind of have them captive and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">right now what we&#39;re asking them to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">is learn how to master taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">standardized tests and what a shame what</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">what a misuse of their human potential</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">to have them studying that instead of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">having them study how to make a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">that difficult to learn how to edit</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">audio enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">and or build a team where you have you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">know you do the minimum so you know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">you need to know but you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">get more than one editing credit</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.279" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">if you work with a team of young people</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s a sample of what worked at</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">my school</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">we usually would have three roles one</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">person would be in front of the camera</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">delivering the content to the camera</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">right somebody else would have been the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">one to write that content to write the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">script</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">and to research it and somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">would be doing the audio and video</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">you know and that piece doing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">technical side and so a team of three</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">then can work together</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">and if you are someone who&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">strong on the reading and writing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">you get to start by being the one on</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">camera looking smart and sounding smart</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">with somebody else&#39;s ideas and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">tends to appeal to to those kids i had</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">kids that were illiterate couldn&#39;t copy</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">a sentence you wrote down a sentence or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">printed a sentence and they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">copy and add another sheet of paper</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">but you give them a microphone and those</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">kids had been hiding their disability</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">their inability to read and write</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">by by listening by listening to radio by</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">having conversations and they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">actually really smart so they were the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">best podcast hosts</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">it was surprising and then we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">celebrate their academic genius because</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">they were really smart</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">and then they would start naturally</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">gravitating toward wanting to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">to read and write more but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">the be all end-all like it is with</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:54.080" style="s2">standardized tests because without that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">you can&#39;t take the damn test</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.080" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">so there are ways that i think it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">actually works so much better when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">experience now</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">i&#39;m not talking about theory here i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">been doing this for 17 years and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">been seeing in the classrooms and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">the kids can</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">participate in projects and some</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">projects you can do groups of three</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:09.679" style="s2">sometimes you need to know that all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">kids do know how to read and write you</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">know we don&#39;t want kids graduating high</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:12.720" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">just knowing how to work a microphone</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.720" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">without being able to read and write so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">they&#39;re forced to do some credits</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">in the research they&#39;re forced to show</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">that they have practiced</p>

<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">is these teams and teamwork and you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">a social studies project but something</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">a significant body of work that alone is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">highly valuable in the world of work</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s right and kids really care about</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">social standing right teenagers in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">so if their work is going to be posted</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:51.599" style="s2">up with other kids from around the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be seen not just by</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.599" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">like that diorama by that one teacher or</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">maybe that one class</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">if it&#39;s going to be seen by everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">that actually is an incentive that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:01.839" style="s2">very strong for young people</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">to motivate them to want to look good</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">kids want to look good</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">flat out right and so if they see</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">somebody else doing something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna steal and borrow from each</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">other to look good</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">in and what we have to do is set up the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">that what looks good is not what is on</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">social media which is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">inflames you know passions it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:23.920" style="s2">generates academic skills and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">this ecosystem that design</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.920" end="00:35:27.200" style="s2">actually is being built right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">the focus is how do we set up the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.200" end="00:35:29.440" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">so that young people can be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.440" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">investors with their sweat equity</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">they&#39;re investing their time and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">attention and that frustration of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">getting through the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">that investment is the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">this new form of academic capital</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">and if we can set the data up so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s measuring to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">how well students overcome those</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.760" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">obstacles and frustration tolerance so</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">that they have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">to gain academic capital and academic</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">capital that is linked to their degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">then we&#39;re starting to drive in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">right direction unlike where</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">our schools are taking our kids now all</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">right well now let&#39;s make the turn let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">do the reveal</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">let&#39;s start talking about your digital</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">native</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">academic ecosystem because from my mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an ecosystem you thought through</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">most of the components on the sourcing</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">the evaluation etc so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">give our audience a five-minute overview</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">on the essentials of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">great so academic capital let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">keep going on that thread</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">in the digital age right it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">industrial age we fought wars with you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">know by dropping bombs and flying planes</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">in the digital age</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">um i&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:33.440" style="s2">something like currency wars that we end</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">up fighting world war iii will be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.440" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">currency war about the dollar&#39;s value or</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying that just because the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">digital age brings forth new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s just one piece that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">notice is that new forms like social</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">capital right</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">capital is a form of control ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">and so in social capital you become an</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">influencer you influence other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">social experience and you measure it you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">always have to have some measure with</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">shares or downloads or followers right</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">and your audience replaces what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">industrialists would look for in profits</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">so if you&#39;re a startup company and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">have a big audience you get funded now</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">not so much profits which is what they</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:11.200" style="s2">used to look for and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">dopamine opioid economy that you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.200" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">now that&#39;s social capital another new</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">form of capital is this academic capital</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">so for high school in particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">students invest that sweat equity</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">that investment becomes the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">of the data set</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">that measures this form of capital so</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">instead of likes or follows what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">talking about is approved credits</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">to your name that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">for in terms of measuring your academic</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">and we&#39;re looking at critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">so can you distinguish signal from noise</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">can you take something and have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">nuanced position on it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">and the key insight that drives this</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">ecosystem or i call it a platform</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">is that we&#39;re using these 10-minute</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">and that creates an incentive system</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">for high quality student work is what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:12.880" style="s2">of dna credits as an ecosystem yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">then we should dive into</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.880" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">taking it from different roles as a</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">what i call a credit studio somebody</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">that makes credits what are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">incentives and how do they work</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s do go into the roles because</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">they&#39;re interesting but let&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">talk about sort of a higher level you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">know architectural component you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:32.560" style="s2">propose that these credits be stored on</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">a public ledger you know a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.560" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">uncorruptable public ledger like bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">but hopefully not one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">accelerating the heat death of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">universe at such a high rate due to all</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">that mining activity</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">then students become autonomous owners</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">of their proof of work</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">essentially so that let&#39;s say they have</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">accumulated 10 credits in the area of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">audio visual production they go look for</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">a job in that area</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">or employment as you talk about probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">the world of jobs is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">going to continue to go away but gig</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">employment and audio visual</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">world they could send the public keys to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">artifacts of theirs to the hirer and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">they could then review the work itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">in a way much more profound than just</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">looking at a resume</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s important for people</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">to understand i&#39;m a high school</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">administrator</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">right so what the change i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">about here i&#39;m not talking about tearing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">down our schools i&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:25.520" style="s2">radical or crazy we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">small administrative shift</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.520" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">in sent from moving from a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">administration of high school credits to</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">a decentralized one</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">the centralized and we haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">about this too much but the centralized</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:37.280" style="s2">high school credit today has almost no</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.280" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">a high school if you don&#39;t know the name</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">of the school if it&#39;s a school you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">never heard of it&#39;s a public school</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">somewhere in new york</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">and you get a transcript and it says</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">they got this many credits of this you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">have no idea what that means and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">colleges don&#39;t trust it so they need</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">these ap</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">exams and sat exams and things to see if</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">people can actually read</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">right so the current high school credit</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">is easy to compete with because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">crap i&#39;m an educator in new york state</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">so let me just compare</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">the new dna credits to new york state</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">credits</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">so a new york state credit is measured</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">in terms of hours of classroom</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">seat time how long you&#39;re locked in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">classroom with a teacher that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">certified</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s not easily adapted for</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">remote learning it&#39;s also not a great</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">measure</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">of a credit for dna credits one credit</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">is earned in one month of full-time work</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">on a final product so it&#39;s 40 hours</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">times like four and a half weeks so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">about 180 hours of work</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">is in one credit the new york state is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">108 hours of classroom seat time</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">now if you assume it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">shocking the first thing that i thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">is wait if you&#39;re only going to earn one</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">credit at a time</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:39.520" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to spend one month on</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">each credit you&#39;re not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.520" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">enough credits in high school well it</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">turns out if you get rid of september</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">and june because you need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">welcome and you need to close down the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">year from october</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">to may is 8 months 8 times 4 is 32.</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">that&#39;s 10 credits more than you get in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">high school annualized credits</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">annualized credits in new york state you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">get 22 credits to graduate in four years</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">so this taking six classes at a time</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">five and a half classes at a time</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.839" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">where the bell rings every you know 40</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">something minutes you actually get less</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">credits than if you could just focus on</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">one project at a time in your last two</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">years of high school</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">one month at a time and do quality work</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">and upload at the end of the month after</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:16.400" style="s2">multiple revisions</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s the other piece is this system</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.400" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">requires three revisions minimum</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">that you upload in the course of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">month so you&#39;re doing the that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:26.319" style="s2">practicing at least three cycles</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">before you upload the final piece so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.319" end="00:41:28.560" style="s2">the transcript that you would get is</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">what you were talking about it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.560" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">transcript or a portfolio that you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">share with employers and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">every credit you could click on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">credit if you&#39;re online or if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">printed form you scan the qr code</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">and you can see the work that went</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">behind that credit so you could check</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">the quality of the credit yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">university instead of interviewing a kid</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.520" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">or instead of doing anything could</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:47.680" style="s2">either trust these credits say wow they</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:49.119" style="s2">got this many of these dna credits</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">or they can click on each one of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.119" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">and see the work itself to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">student was capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">so that the transcript itself has the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">proof of work built into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">unlike the new york state transcript</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">that you get right now and say oh what</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">was your sat score</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">right because the transcript itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">means nothing not to mention the fact</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">that in the old system</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">the teacher that grades you is the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">teacher that&#39;s delivering instruction</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">the same teacher that wrote the content</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">a terrible system because very few</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">teachers are good at all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">in this system the work is graded</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">anonymously by a committee of three</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">credit experts</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">so the teacher is not creating their own</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">work so students can&#39;t guilt trip them</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">or manipulate them or do anything to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">the credit they have to do quality work</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">to get the credit</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">so it establishes this gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">high school credit that people trust</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">because they can verify it for</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">and in a world where current high school</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">all i&#39;m doing is taking the high school</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">transcript high school credits and</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">to that change yeah and i was hoping you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">were going to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">radical</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">which is to break up these large</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">granular credits into smaller credits</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">and i suspect if you don&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">may have a</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:19.119" style="s2">how do you actually communicate a whole</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.119" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">let me give you an example let&#39;s suppose</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">the person&#39;s looking for their</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">ninth grade civics credit right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:29.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a shitload of content</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">in a ninth grade civics course you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.680" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">how a bill becomes a law</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">you know states counties and local how</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">do they work together what is federalism</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">and of course many schools aren&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">such a good job but i was lucky to go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">one that did do a good job we got a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">full year of this kind of civics</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:47.839" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">now in a 10-minute video i might be able</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.839" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">to explain how a bill becomes a law</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">but i certainly couldn&#39;t come even close</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">to surfacing all the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">you really ought to learn if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">going to learn the equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">of 9th grade civics so is there</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">impedance mismatch between the content</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">on one</p>

<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">a 10-minute podcast so when students</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">flip from it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">when students flip from being consumers</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">of content to creators of content the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">change is from focusing on the content</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">that they need to consume</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">to focusing on the skills they need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">build like muscles the mental skills</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">the academic skills for that context so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:33.280" style="s2">for civics</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">what would be the skills that we&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.280" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">students to master</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">to understand civics and then we want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">set them up in situations if it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">election year we want them to go to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">campaign appearances or actually have</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">of civics not talking about civics we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">want them involved with civics in a real</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">and then their the the ten minute</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">podcast is</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">their engaging those skills so</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a matter of redefining the credits</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">in terms of academic skills that we want</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">them to master</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.760" style="s2">and then they will you know remember the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">content that they interact with much</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.760" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">more than if they had to memorize a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">civics you know textbook for a test</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">but they will also gain some genuine</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">curiosity and interest in the content</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">because they&#39;ll understand the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">importance and they&#39;ll have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">how much power they have or don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">or what the problems are with the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">by interacting with it in reality not in</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">a textbook</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">on the other hand they may learn some</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">good things but they may not learn the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">all the way back to jefferson were</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">thought to be indispensable for good</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">citizenship which</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">first and above all else is how does the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">machinery of state</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">actually work i mean if a person doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">know how a bill becomes a law</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">and you know how the legislative</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">executive and judicial</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">our checks and balances on each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">pretty hard to be a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">so i would say that yes this</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">experiential learning is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">very good and very valuable but there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">just some plain old content which if</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to prepare our young people</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">to be first-class citizens they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.720" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">to have to absorb it&#39;s not clear to me a</p>

<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">worth of civics is likely to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">if you have an interview set up with</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">somebody involved in civics a politician</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">for example and my students interviewed</p>

<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">to sit down to the interview you had to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">have done enough research and understand</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">right and so you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">enough about how bill becomes a law you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">have to go back and do that research</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">back and edit the final product</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to get the credit right</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:32.880" style="s2">so the credit can have built into it you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">need to demonstrate that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.880" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">showed up to the interview with some</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">understanding now are we going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">have standards that have our checklist</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">to say did the student do the students</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">this particular piece of content and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">this one no that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">old industrial way to do things and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s working because</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">people you ask people what they learned</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">in high school about this stuff and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">don&#39;t remember any of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">so what we&#39;re doing is looking at brain</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">research and how people actually learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">to make sure that they&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">something meaningful that sticks with</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">them so that they are an</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">active participant in civics for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">rest of their life that&#39;s the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">that we want</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">is them to be and then if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">actively participating you over time</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">learn more and more nuance about how the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">system works because you interact with</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">where it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">okay that&#39;s i think reasonable like</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">anything else i&#39;m a great empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">and i&#39;d say try it and see if it works</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">right and you&#39;ve been trying it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">we have been for we have been right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s when you see the kids work i</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:26.480" style="s2">think the difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">in me sharing those people and people</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">that haven&#39;t experienced it is i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">all the hundreds and hundreds of videos</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">these kids have produced</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">music video i mean some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">moving stuff for music videos and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">how in the hell can you make a music</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">video to cover</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:41.359" style="s2">civil rights and then you see what you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.359" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">on youtube there are these guys that do</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">the challenges between</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">historical figures epic rap battles of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">history have you ever seen any of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard of them but i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">actually seen any of them those are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">kind of things that students make</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">and you and you watch one of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re three or four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">they&#39;re very short</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">and you can get that the people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">wrote that content knew the history they</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">had to study that to put it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">together and to write that rap</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the kind of content i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:06.480" style="s2">seen it you have to experience it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">just like i&#39;m saying about the kids and</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.480" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">you have to experience this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">content to see how three or four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">can convince you that this kid learned</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.599" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">about the content and epic rap battles</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">history i think are the greatest example</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">of what i think high school</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">students should be producing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">irreverent they&#39;re intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">they go into depth the production</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">quality is high i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of stuff i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">coming out of our high schools i&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.839" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">much higher rate than it is now</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">very interesting well let&#39;s go down into</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">the details a little bit further we</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">talked about the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:35.599" style="s2">credits would be stored on a public</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">ledger where they couldn&#39;t be corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.599" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">and they could always be</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.640" style="s2">accessed and distributed by the students</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">to whoever had a need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.640" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">have access to them the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">teachers you renamed</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">catalysts as i recall talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">little bit how the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">classroom teacher changes their role</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">quite dramatically in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">system yeah so a system like this just</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">like when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">opened up taxis with uber you suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">had a lot more people becoming drivers</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s what i call catalyst in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">book is a coach</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">is somebody that&#39;s helping the young</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">person with the podcasting or video</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">editing with the digital</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">literacy skills right the old literacy</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">was reading and writing new literacy</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">involves editing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">and you know discerning videos and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">they&#39;re helping with those digital</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">native skills because some classroom</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">teachers won&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">and so this system offers them a coach</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:24.960" style="s2">that works like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">tech support you know online coach that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.960" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">supports them in those pieces so that a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">classroom teacher can take on these</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">projects even if they don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">produce a podcast or make a video</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">the catalyst plays the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">educator of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">digital native skill set now a classroom</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">teacher a younger classroom teacher</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">might be able to do that themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">so they can sign up onto the system and</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">tell the kids hey when you sign in</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">list put me as your coach and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">that teacher by becoming the coach gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">to access some of the benefits some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">the incentives of the system</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">a teacher that doesn&#39;t participate as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">coach that just</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">does lets the students choose a project</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">from the system and supports them in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">academic</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">research academic skills whatever they</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">are research or</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">writing or delivering content that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">common core standards have speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">listening so the current standards work</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">very well for these credits</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">those teachers would get the curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">for free they wouldn&#39;t have to write the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">it would be a project-based curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">and they would get out of having to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">teach to test</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">a kid instead of sitting for an ap</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">history exam could get the option to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">you could either sit for the ap test or</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">you can make an ap video</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">that&#39;s certified by the the college</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">board and upload to them and they grade</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">and so the students could choose whether</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.440" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">they make a video for the class or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">whether they take a test for the class</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">and it would be a number of videos</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">because if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">you know nine month course they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">make you know nine videos over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">course of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">of the nine credits so the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">teacher has a few options now if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">choose to be that digital coach</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">the incentives are very strong because</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">they then if you become a digital coach</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">and you become very effective that all</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:57.599" style="s2">your students</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:59.520" style="s2">that you coach earn the credit which</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.599" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">means that when you told them that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.520" end="00:52:02.720" style="s2">thought their work was</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">ready to be uploaded that anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.720" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">committee of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">credit experts when they evaluate say</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">hey yes indeed you were right that one</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">is ready for a credit that earns a</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.079" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">a teacher that reliably does that then</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">can flip over to the side of being a</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">credit expert</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">based on their track record of showing</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">performance with students</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">actual students producing these credits</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">and when you are a credit expert you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">paid</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">30 bucks per 10 minute piece you</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">evaluate so depending on how long it</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">takes you to grade a 10 minute piece</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">and just say credit no credit you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">giving a 60 or 70 or any of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">you&#39;re just saying one or zero credit no</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">credit pass or fail</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">um and and you can make a nice side</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">hustle in the evenings instead of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">becoming an administrator</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">like i did becoming a principal you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">stay in your classroom and a few nights</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">a week or a few days on the weekends you</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">can grade pieces</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">and make up to 180 bucks an hour doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">administration of credits looks like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">instead of these people working for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">department of education with all their</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">union</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">stuff that ends up focusing on adult</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">interests not on what&#39;s good for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">kids and on political interests</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">these people work from their homes kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">of like uber drivers or airbnb hosts</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:06.880" style="s2">grading work that they are experts in</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">grading and then getting paid for that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.880" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">so there&#39;s an incentive to become one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">those catalysts</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">but also as a classroom teacher you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">use the system</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">just to get high quality curricula and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">have to do a lot less work yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">including grading the final project you</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:20.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have to even do yourself so there</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">are incentives</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">yeah both ways and one thing i liked a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:26.400" style="s2">lot about your system</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">being a person who understands human</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">nature a little bit i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">you need checks and balances right when</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">people are as you say the teachers are</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">doing the teaching and they&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">testing and they&#39;re doing the evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.880" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">hmm right right your system had</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">what you called gatekeepers were there i</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">think you had another name for them too</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">what it was for the people who approved</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">or didn&#39;t approve the artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">talk a little bit about that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">particularly how do you get a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">standard of quality that a community of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:55.920" style="s2">gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:57.280" style="s2">are more or less in agreement on because</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.920" end="00:54:00.000" style="s2">it would be very unfair</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.280" end="00:54:02.000" style="s2">if this gatekeeper would pass this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.000" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">artifact and this gatekeeper wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:05.119" style="s2">that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:05.839" style="s2">sort of a fundamental flaw in the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.119" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.839" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">gatekeepers sorry what i called when i</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:10.319" style="s2">wrote the book gatekeepers were now</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">calling working with the the app is</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.319" end="00:54:12.000" style="s2">actually being built in the app they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:15.599" style="s2">credit experts so i was talking a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">bit about that before so each piece is</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.599" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">graded by a committee of three of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">it&#39;s anonymous they don&#39;t know each</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">other so they can&#39;t talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">about and the students don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">they grade and at the end of the month</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">when the final grades are in</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">and they&#39;ve been put in then the credit</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">experts get to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">if there are three of them if they voted</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">with the majority or not right</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:34.319" style="s2">so if they voted a credit and said it</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">was worth the credit but the other two</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.319" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">credit experts said it wasn&#39;t worth the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:39.440" style="s2">it&#39;s in their interest to go and study</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">where the discrepancies were because if</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.440" end="00:54:42.319" style="s2">they do that too many times they will</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">lose the right to continue evaluating</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.319" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">credits because</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re saying something&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">the credit when it but two other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">are saying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">um so they then and then they can learn</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">who each other are and talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">other after the credits are finally in</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of how they grow and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">normalize their practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">now remember they&#39;re being paid for this</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">so there&#39;s an incentive to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">um and let me step back a second they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">being paid and there&#39;s a credit studio</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">who wrote the curriculum who wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">credit and who set the standard saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">this is what</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">a piece needs in order to be accepted</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">here&#39;s how you look for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">students practicing the skills in order</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">to accept this as a credit</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">now that credit studios reputation is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">based on the quality</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">of student work because you can go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">that credit you can see all the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">that have uploaded work and gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">credit for it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">and so as a high school principal i</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">would go into a system and watch a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">of the pieces before i decide if my</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">students are gonna be allowed to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">this credit in my school</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.559" style="s2">so the credits themselves need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">maintain a high standard if their credit</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.559" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">experts if their gatekeepers start</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">giving away credits for free</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">the quality of that credit is going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">diminish and it will lose value and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">it&#39;s that crowd source that crowd</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">intelligence thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">that the crowd is going to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">quality because everyone can see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:49.920" style="s2">credits</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">and so everyone can watch and say wait</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.920" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">this is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">you know look at these how how is this a</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">credit they didn&#39;t know what the student</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">so instead of the current system which</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">top down and kind of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">they&#39;re surveilling the teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">trying to monitor and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s very oppressive the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">way teachers are asked to produce data</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">this is a surveillance approach where</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">the people the teachers the students the</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">parents the universities everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">looking at this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">and they can see when something has no</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">value or when it does have value so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">verification happens in a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">with these credits rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">centralized way if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">yeah they don&#39;t want to be too cynical</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">but why wouldn&#39;t the reaction in some</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">cases be for the principal to look for</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">lowest level of passes right you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">everyone wants to have no child left</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">behind so</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">say there&#39;s a you know 100 civics</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.160" style="s2">templates competing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">what keeps the principal from selecting</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.160" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">the easiest past one rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:49.359" style="s2">rigorous well because parents then would</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:50.799" style="s2">see the type of work that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.359" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">produced to that school</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.799" end="00:56:54.400" style="s2">now in the school system that that city</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">might say hey you need to only you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.400" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">only prove the ones that we&#39;ve reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">and we&#39;ve approved</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">or you could have someone like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">college board saying these are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">we approve and the parents are gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">hey i want my kids to have college board</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">certified ap</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">credits i don&#39;t want them getting you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.040" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">know some other credit made by</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">some librarian somewhere that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s it&#39;s again that the pressures</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">of the system is based on the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">incentives are designed to drive quality</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">of the student content</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">and so if you don&#39;t have quality student</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">content your credits will just not be</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">noticed or not be in demand</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">and if you&#39;re a principal that chooses</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">to have lower quality</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">credits that&#39;s going to be obvious by</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">the type of work that you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">when people go to study your institution</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">they&#39;re going to see the type of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.520" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">institution you are quite openly</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">and not to mention the city or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">district is going to look and say</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">what is this why are you choosing why</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:41.599" style="s2">are you choosing these credits</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">right because it&#39;s they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.599" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">held to the fire by the parents</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:46.720" style="s2">and the students frankly who want higher</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:48.079" style="s2">quality credits</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">yeah i can see the curation would</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.079" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">certainly help you to say this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">been approved by</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:53.920" style="s2">harvard right exactly if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">have your credit counted at harvard it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.920" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">has to be here</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">what we would probably see in such an</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">ecosystem that&#39;s why i called it an</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">ecosystem it&#39;s more than just a platform</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">that&#39;s right because</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">if it&#39;s an ecosystem there can be life</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">evolving outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.319" style="s2">formal protocols of the initial system</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">itself so it actually gets richer over</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:13.119" style="s2">in a way that uber only slightly does</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">you know a true ecosystem gets much</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.119" end="00:58:16.319" style="s2">richer over time than uber has</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">right in terms of the number of things</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.319" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s built one of the things you might</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">is for there to be you know independent</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">bodies that then certify these templates</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">as you say that&#39;s called the ivy league</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">consortium or something it says</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">exactly you know this set of themes is</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">acceptable to the ivy league and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">you&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:34.559" style="s2">all the sub ivy&#39;s adopted and all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">tier one restate your research</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.559" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">universities adopt that same</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">curation standard and then for high</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">schools</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">where any percentage of the people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">looking to get accepted to at least the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">tier one state school</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">pretty much gonna have to go with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.599" style="s2">curation standard something like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">right otherwise i could see</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.599" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">frankly not all principles are great</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">everything is on a curve</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">and unless there are some checks and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">balances it would be easy to see</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">principals take an easy way out</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">and going for the easy templates with</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">the soft gatekeeper</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:04.559" style="s2">no doubt and think of it from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">college border from harvard or from</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.559" end="00:59:08.319" style="s2">apple even right if you want</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">having that having that name on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.319" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">credit will give it some prestige</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">so they have some influence in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.000" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">system to say hey here&#39;s our brand of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:17.280" style="s2">but instead of having to create the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">content they can just go and look for</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.280" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">which teachers have produced something</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">that they really love</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">based on the student work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">produced so some teacher working out in</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">kansas</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">might produce a really great curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:27.920" style="s2">that the college board then grabs and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">says hey we&#39;re approving we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.920" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">our staff of approval on this one and</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:31.599" style="s2">that teacher</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">is getting recognition and making money</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.599" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">for their work that they had just been</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">doing with their own students and now</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:37.839" style="s2">students across the country can benefit</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">from it because the college board has</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.839" end="00:59:41.520" style="s2">said this is now an ap credit</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">so the college board gets this source of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.520" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">creativity of decentralized innovation</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:46.880" style="s2">that they can just look and curate the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:48.079" style="s2">best stuff because everybody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.880" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">have their label on it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.079" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">rather than them having to from the top</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">down create these standardized tests</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">that evaluate whether people are smart</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:55.760" style="s2">or not right</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:57.680" style="s2">the college board if they look at this</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.760" end="00:59:59.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge incentive to trade</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.680" end="01:00:01.839" style="s2">grading right now you pay them to grade</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.920" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">an exam instead have that pay them to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.839" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">grade a video</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:06.079" style="s2">and that video content they can just</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.799" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">look and grab the best stuff because</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.079" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">what teacher wouldn&#39;t want the college</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">board to put their stamp of approval on</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">it there&#39;s nothing to lose</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:13.440" style="s2">yeah i think building out these other</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:14.640" style="s2">aspects of the ecosystem will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.440" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.640" end="01:00:18.480" style="s2">to cause the system to converge to</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">quality which you make it very clear</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.480" end="01:00:21.599" style="s2">that you want the other question i had</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">as i was reading is</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.599" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">hmm the idea that the gatekeepers or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">credit experts are anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">if we want them to have skin in the game</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">why not put their name on what they</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">approve</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">right because so now they&#39;re anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:35.359" style="s2">during the grading once the grading is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">closed at the end of the term you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.359" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">see who it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">right ah okay as long as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">accountable for what they approve</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:43.280" style="s2">and so you know they started proving</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2"> and everybody knows they approve</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.280" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2"> and then people say hey we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">going to hire you to be our</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">credit expert anymore because you proved</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2"> right well the system can actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">just say anytime there&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.119" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">three you know there&#39;s two other people</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.400" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">grading this piece if you come out lower</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">saying it was worth the credit and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">other two come out</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:59.520" style="s2">not the credit studio is going to revoke</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.520" end="01:01:02.640" style="s2">credit expert you know approval to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">in there and approve credits and have</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.640" end="01:01:05.119" style="s2">them in your queue</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">so you you know that two other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.119" end="01:01:07.520" style="s2">are gonna be holding you accountable and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">you&#39;ll get to see who they are when the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.520" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">credits are done and you can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:10.960" style="s2">them anymore you don&#39;t want them talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">to each other and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.960" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">fixing it but once the grades are in and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">kind of you know in on the blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">and hard and fast and can&#39;t be changed</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:18.240" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">they need to learn and that&#39;s when they</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.240" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">can go and talk to each other and find</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">each other and see what they were</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">yeah yeah okay good so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:27.359" style="s2">misunderstood it so as long as the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">credit expert is not anonymous on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.359" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">blockchain then i think the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">tendency to converge to quality will</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">work and there&#39;s less pernicious</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">potential collusion i&#39;d say that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.040" style="s2">know that right you know there&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">amount of game theory where even if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.040" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">don&#39;t know who the other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">are you realize you all have kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:46.480" style="s2">prisoner&#39;s dilemma situation we&#39;ll all</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:48.319" style="s2">be sleazy right</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">and if we&#39;re all sleazy we all get paid</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.319" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">off so there are some ways to collude</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">even in ways that are anonymous so uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:56.400" style="s2">having that second</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">thing that the uh the certifiers have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.400" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">public in their certifications after the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">fact i think is important</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.319" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">yeah and all of these things i i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">very skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">a lot of this distributed governance</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">stuff and bitcoin is really what</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.680" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">had me start writing the book and figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">this out i can&#39;t i just don&#39;t can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.319" style="s2">believe that bitcoin exists</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">right that the incentives worked out so</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.319" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">that we can decentralize</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">money if you can do it to money you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">do it the high school credits</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">um maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">the issue is that money is actually easy</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s a fungible product you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">every dollar is like every other dollar</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">uh you know every credit&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">every other credit every student&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:33.200" style="s2">like every other student</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">so i would say it&#39;s actually going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.200" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">a lot harder to build the governance</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:38.720" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:39.839" style="s2">and the guard rails on your system than</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.720" end="01:02:42.000" style="s2">it was for bitcoin</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.839" end="01:02:43.039" style="s2">bitcoin is actually remarkably simple</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s one of those things when i read</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.039" end="01:02:46.319" style="s2">satoshi&#39;s paper a couple of months after</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.720" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">it was published i slapped myself in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.319" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">forehead and said</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">damn why didn&#39;t i think of that right</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">but your system is going to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">because of the fact that all the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">elements are unfungible it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">a lot harder it&#39;s a this is a squishier</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.319" style="s2">problem but bitcoin is at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">existence proof</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.319" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">that things of this sort can work so</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:06.880" style="s2">that that right makes us hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">now the other obvious question to sort</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.880" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">of think about the structure</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">is how does it deal with potential for</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:14.319" style="s2">cheating right what keeps a fluent</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">parent from hiring a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.319" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">hollywood video producer and you know a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:21.920" style="s2">you know top-notch new york city script</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:23.520" style="s2">writer to work with their kid to produce</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.920" end="01:03:25.039" style="s2">a knockout video</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.520" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">right well i mean it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.039" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">that happens now with you know tutoring</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.039" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">for it you know to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">you can get tutored now to ace these</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">tests without really knowing much of</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">anything you just learn how the tests</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:37.359" style="s2">in this system it&#39;s the what we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">talked about is the anti-bias piece of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.359" end="01:03:42.000" style="s2">um how these blocks are formed</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">and we want this to be a world where</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.000" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">what zip code you come from should not</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:46.160" style="s2">determine</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.280" style="s2">your educational outcomes right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:49.200" style="s2">the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.280" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">and so what the system does is says</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.200" end="01:03:52.880" style="s2">let&#39;s start operationalizing that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">measuring how effectively we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.880" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">um by saying how many kids in each zip</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">code are earning these credits</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">and let&#39;s require for example this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">the um the</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">the anti-bias criteria will be set by</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">students but it could be for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:07.839" style="s2">that every</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:08.960" style="s2">zip code has to have a comparable number</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.839" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">of them to form a block</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.960" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">they can get the credits okay you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.039" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">earn the credits without being part of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">block</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:16.640" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t talked about the basic</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">income piece but if the students get to</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">be part of a block</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">on the academic capital blockchain they</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">form a block of academic capital</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">that means they&#39;re going to be paid out</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">in this internet funny money for 25</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:28.000" style="s2">years they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">get basically a basic income of money</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.000" end="01:04:30.079" style="s2">that&#39;s not worth anything unless they</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">make it worth something so</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.079" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">which will have whatever value the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">community creates it to have</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:39.039" style="s2">so every zip code would have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">participate equally so if the bronx in</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.039" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">new york city</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">only gets one of these certain types of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">credits then only one person from each</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">other zip code could get one of those</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">credits</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:49.200" style="s2">and so people that want a game system</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:50.960" style="s2">have to then</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.200" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">be incentivized to help people in every</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.960" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">zip code game the system</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t just help your zip code if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">want to get this basic income and form</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">academic capital which is kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">most prestigious part</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">of these credits there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">credits though that will be the system</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">that will never form blocks of academic</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">capital they&#39;ll just be credits</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">on your portfolio and so for those</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">individual credits</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">sure uh private school could have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:12.160" style="s2">editing lab and could have hollywood</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">producers</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.160" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">just like when we did the robotics team</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">some of the teams had</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">you know their teams met at general</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:20.079" style="s2">motors fabrication plan with laser</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">cutters and</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.079" end="01:05:23.440" style="s2">they had advantages that we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a reality in</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.440" end="01:05:27.520" style="s2">producing high quality content</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s much easier to fake it on a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.520" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">test than it is faking on a video where</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:32.799" style="s2">on you know when you&#39;re producing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:34.160" style="s2">video and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.799" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">that you can&#39;t just copy and paste</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s video where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">just learn how to game the system the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">student would have to learn enough about</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">video production</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">yeah they can hire tutors and coaches</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">certainly and to get an advantage</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">that is that that is going to be part of</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">most systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:51.200" style="s2">of uh high stakes data yeah although of</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:52.319" style="s2">course in artifacts it may actually be</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.200" end="01:05:54.079" style="s2">easier to cheat</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.319" end="01:05:56.000" style="s2">you know at least in a test you have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.079" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">stuff it into your head if only for one</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">with an artifact and frankly you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">other than the</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">being the having a person on the screen</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">all the rest could be</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">cheated you know they would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">pretty pernicious cheating the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">adults involved would have to know their</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">chain because there&#39;s three revisions</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.920" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">that they&#39;re doing so they&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">kind of do a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">low quality version first to upload and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">get some feedback they&#39;d have to go</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">through the process with this coach</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">somebody would have to really be</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">interested in um and have this cheating</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">mentality of pretending of faking to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">the student</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">throughout the month of three cycles of</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">revision and throughout the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">communications and you have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:31.599" style="s2">you know pretend to be them in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.839" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">discussions and in the feedback sessions</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.599" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">and right</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s to produce to have a team</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:37.039" style="s2">produce content</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:39.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interaction that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.039" end="01:06:40.319" style="s2">happens and so to get somebody to sit in</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.039" end="01:06:41.039" style="s2">for you and all that interaction is</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.319" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">really a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.039" end="01:06:44.559" style="s2">you know a pretty deep level of cheating</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">that somebody that an adult or a movie</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.559" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">producer would have to be involved with</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:49.520" style="s2">but of course as we&#39;ve seen uh the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">length some parents will go to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:54.319" style="s2">ridiculous so something something</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">happened i did have two ideas on how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.319" end="01:06:57.920" style="s2">push back against cheating one would be</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:00.480" style="s2">to develop</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.920" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">partnerships with the tool companies and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.480" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">or build a meta</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.839" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">app and meta app would be much better</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">because that we could plug any software</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:08.079" style="s2">tool into it</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">that literally monitors the student</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.079" end="01:07:12.480" style="s2">doing the work you know uses the camera</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:14.799" style="s2">does some machine learning on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.480" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">keyboard sequences etc</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.799" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">and builds a verification file attached</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">work product which if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:24.799" style="s2">question by the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">content experts the credit experts they</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.799" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">could then dig into this</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">audit file and see was that the kid</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:32.640" style="s2">doing the typing or doing the audio</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">editing</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.640" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">etc and then another one which may</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:38.000" style="s2">actually be</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:40.480" style="s2">better because it&#39;s so simple and yet so</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.000" end="01:07:40.960" style="s2">powerful is have associated with each</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">one an</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.960" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">oral examination kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:47.119" style="s2">the phd oral exam but</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">five minutes worth oxford yeah and it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.119" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">be really hard to fake</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:53.680" style="s2">an oral exam right say well how did you</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.440" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">use audacity to do this editing and they</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.680" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">go huh</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">what&#39;s audacity well guess what the kid</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:07:59.039" style="s2">cheated right so anyway i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">thinking about ways</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.039" end="01:08:04.079" style="s2">because again i&#39;m a person who&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">thinks in terms of evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.079" end="01:08:07.280" style="s2">and evolutionary theory always points us</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">to arms races</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.280" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">and to cheating and so those are some of</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:13.119" style="s2">the ideas that i had at least and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">sure there are plenty of better ones</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.119" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">i love those ideas one of them actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:16.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about so the team that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:18.159" style="s2">developing this app one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.560" end="01:08:18.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about is you know gym</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.159" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">credits or</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.880" end="01:08:22.640" style="s2">mental health or physical health credits</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.319" style="s2">can you plug in external apps</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.640" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">exercise apps foot counting apps</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.319" end="01:08:27.600" style="s2">mindfulness apps and if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">mindfulness what stops the person from</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.600" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">saying they&#39;re meditating and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">to get their health credit right um and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:33.920" style="s2">so we were talking about you know so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">could point the camera yourself and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.920" end="01:08:36.960" style="s2">have some ai and face recognition right</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">so these things are coming about now the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.960" end="01:08:39.520" style="s2">beauty of the system of a decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.520" end="01:08:42.400" style="s2">i can never pretend to be smart enough</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:42.799" style="s2">to imagine the types of credits that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.400" end="01:08:44.080" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">on board so if cheating becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.080" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">problem the value will go to credits</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">have anti-cheating protocols like you</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">were talking about the credit could</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">actually be a live</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">podcast where you&#39;re interviewed right</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">by the coach that coach you through the</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:08:59.759" style="s2">and the interview that live interview is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">actually the audio that&#39;s uploaded</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:03.600" style="s2">so i think people like you who are much</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:04.080" style="s2">smarter than me will come up with ways</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.600" end="01:09:05.679" style="s2">to design</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.080" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">credits that solve these things and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.679" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">decentralized system instead of counting</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">on one</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">pretty thick headed department of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:12.560" style="s2">education and what they can imagine and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">what they can allow and what they can</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:15.359" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">you know see as rounds of possibility</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.359" end="01:09:18.319" style="s2">you&#39;re decentralizing hey anybody that</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:21.040" style="s2">can come up with</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.319" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">a credit that is more verifiable um and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.040" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">that prevents cheating and levels of</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">playing field</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">will get a market advantage and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">credit will get more people submitting</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.000" end="01:09:28.640" style="s2">to it more people demanding it and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:30.560" style="s2">more money running through it</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.640" end="01:09:31.920" style="s2">um so yeah i think that i think there</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.560" end="01:09:33.359" style="s2">are going to be a lot of innovations</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.920" end="01:09:35.279" style="s2">like that that i can&#39;t imagine but a</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.359" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">system like this that&#39;s just the rails</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.279" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">just the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.159" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what i tend to allow is</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">that kind of intelligence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.159" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">clearly people smarter than me that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:43.839" style="s2">going to come up with answers that i</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:45.120" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine that and the system is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.839" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">designed to welcome them</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.120" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">ah that&#39;s a very good answer because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:51.600" style="s2">a believer that if you set the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">up such that the incentives within the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.600" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">ecosystem produce</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:57.199" style="s2">aim for good value then sooner or later</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">the problem will be solved so as you</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.199" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">describe that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">so those people who publish templates</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">for credits</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:05.760" style="s2">some of them may have some of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">anti-cheating mechanisms built in</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.760" end="01:10:09.280" style="s2">right exactly they could have the either</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">application monitors or they could have</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.280" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">oral exams or they could have</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">who knows what ekgs you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:16.239" style="s2">right who knows what the future may</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">bring but yeah if you have the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.239" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">such that</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:20.480" style="s2">there are incentives for the template</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:22.719" style="s2">producers to</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.480" end="01:10:24.159" style="s2">you know make them as secure as possible</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.719" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">and they can compete on their</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.159" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">security as well as the other aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:31.600" style="s2">then over time you would hope that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">ratchet of competition would move the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.600" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">system towards a better and better place</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">and you are absolutely right</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:38.320" style="s2">there is nobody smart enough to figure</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">all this stuff out in advance it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.320" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">one step at a time one step two steps</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">one step back complex systems are</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">inherently unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">and you know the only reasonable way to</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">proceed is via</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:52.560" style="s2">empiricism and experiment right and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">having an increasing the number of</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.560" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">experiments being conducted and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">what this intends to do is just</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">explode the number of credits that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">trying to see which ones work</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">and remember what we&#39;re competing</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:03.840" style="s2">against in this covet era people are not</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:04.480" style="s2">going to go sit in a room to take an</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.840" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">exam together</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.480" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting crammed into a room</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:08.880" style="s2">with no windows to take exams much more</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">so people are taking these exams on</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.880" end="01:11:11.760" style="s2">computers at home</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:13.360" style="s2">possibly so how do you insure the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.760" end="01:11:15.199" style="s2">security how did like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.360" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s so easy to cheat on the ap exams</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.199" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">now you can get your uncle to sit down</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">and take the exam there&#39;s no way for the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">system not to know that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:24.560" style="s2">that issue of cheating um in as we go to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:26.080" style="s2">more decentralized learning</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.560" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">what we want to do is create the right</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.080" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">incentives so that the problems are</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">solved within the ecosystem like you</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">just described</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s all based on the incentives</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.760" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">rather than on any top-down system we</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:36.640" style="s2">just want to create a decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:38.320" style="s2">community that is interested in this and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.640" end="01:11:39.040" style="s2">tries to solve it because their own</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.320" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.040" end="01:11:43.280" style="s2">would be served yeah that i think is</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">exactly the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">you talk about that the credit experts</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:51.760" style="s2">would either pass or fail zero or</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:52.640" style="s2">one why not a trinary a pass high pass</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.760" end="01:11:53.840" style="s2">and fail</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.640" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting you say that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.840" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">there is kind of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:58.239" style="s2">about in there so there&#39;s just pass or</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">fail there&#39;s just one or zero</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.239" end="01:12:02.880" style="s2">but there is that incentive to get on to</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:04.640" style="s2">to create a block of academic capital</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.880" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">and when you create a block of academic</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.640" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">capital again you get 25 years of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:09.520" style="s2">basic income put into your wallet in</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:11.600" style="s2">cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.520" end="01:12:13.440" style="s2">so there is a actual incentive for young</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.600" end="01:12:15.199" style="s2">people to want to get onto these blocks</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.440" end="01:12:16.880" style="s2">and the only way to get onto the block</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:18.640" style="s2">aside from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.880" end="01:12:19.920" style="s2">meeting the anti-bias criteria is to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.640" end="01:12:21.440" style="s2">above and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.920" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">on a certain credit so if you&#39;re if the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.440" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">people grading your credit say this work</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t just earn the credit they went</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:27.760" style="s2">above and beyond you actually get a fast</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:28.560" style="s2">track to get into that basic income</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.760" end="01:12:30.239" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.560" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">so there&#39;s really just pass fail and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.239" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">above and beyond and that above and</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:35.199" style="s2">beyond is is intended to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:36.960" style="s2">encourage kids to go further not because</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.199" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">right now you know in so many schools</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.960" end="01:12:40.480" style="s2">you just want to do the bare minimum</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">to get past um and so we wanted to put</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.480" end="01:12:42.719" style="s2">an incentive in to have kids go way</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.719" end="01:12:46.080" style="s2">in a month if in that month they can you</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:46.640" style="s2">know go deeper than they were expected</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.080" end="01:12:48.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.640" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">and show off that there is actual</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.159" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">financial prize waiting for them for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">ones that do that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">you know i have to admit i read it twice</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:58.560" style="s2">your theory about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:13:00.239" style="s2">funny money blockchain ubi i think you</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.560" end="01:13:03.360" style="s2">called it a b.i.g</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.239" end="01:13:04.960" style="s2">and i was not convinced i&#39;ll give you a</p>

<p begin="01:13:04.960" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">explain what it is first and why you</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.719" end="01:13:10.640" style="s2">think it would work so</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s important that our educational</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.640" end="01:13:13.840" style="s2">system first let me just say that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">talked about a little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.840" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">having diversity of thought in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">classroom</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:19.440" style="s2">if you have if you&#39;re in a big city if</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2">you&#39;re out in the country it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.440" end="01:13:23.600" style="s2">different thing but if in your community</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:25.199" style="s2">there is diversity but in your classroom</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.600" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">there is no diversity</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.199" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">there is a huge piece of education</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s being missing if everybody thinks</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:30.560" style="s2">the same way in a classroom it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:32.880" style="s2">better if you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.560" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">diversity of thought to generate you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.880" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">know the kids that come out of that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">diverse classrooms</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">will have um you know many social skills</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:39.760" style="s2">and understand different cultures in</p>

<p begin="01:13:39.760" end="01:13:43.199" style="s2">that are very important so i think that</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.600" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">diversity is kind of a foundation to</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.199" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">critical thinking and i was looking at</p>

<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:49.520" style="s2">critical thinking in that sense how to</p>

<p begin="01:13:49.520" end="01:13:52.000" style="s2">people different from them and have</p>

<p begin="01:14:20.400" end="01:14:23.760" style="s2">was to go beyond just earning a credit</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.400" end="01:14:26.560" style="s2">and start generating</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.760" end="01:14:28.080" style="s2">academic capital um that was a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.560" end="01:14:29.199" style="s2">kind of more prestigious like an award</p>

<p begin="01:14:34.320" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">it could end up on centralized databases</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:38.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t give a damn</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:39.840" style="s2">i want the time with the platform to</p>

<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">to run a blockchain a these bundling of</p>

<p begin="01:14:51.520" end="01:14:55.920" style="s2">i think gives them an experience of</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.920" end="01:14:58.960" style="s2">participation one that i think is an</p>

<p begin="01:15:02.480" end="01:15:06.320" style="s2">and get a return on their investment in</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">and actually get this these coins</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:15.840" style="s2">distributed them every month after that</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">i thought was an opportunity to offer an</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.840" end="01:15:19.920" style="s2">incentive to young people</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:20.800" style="s2">to interact with kind of new generation</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.800" end="01:15:24.159" style="s2">and to think about diversity and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.800" end="01:15:25.440" style="s2">critical thinking in a deeper way so</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.159" end="01:15:26.880" style="s2">that they&#39;re owning the process rather</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.440" end="01:15:28.560" style="s2">than having the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.880" end="01:15:29.760" style="s2">educational system own that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.560" end="01:15:30.239" style="s2">where i was coming from is just to</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.760" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.239" end="01:15:34.000" style="s2">an incentive structure using a</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:35.520" style="s2">blockchain basic income now i also think</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.000" end="01:15:36.560" style="s2">that the foundation of the digital</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:38.320" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.560" end="01:15:40.159" style="s2">is going to be in education the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.320" end="01:15:40.560" style="s2">communities that have a good education</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.159" end="01:15:42.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.560" end="01:15:43.760" style="s2">right that students really maintain</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.000" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">their love of learning learn that</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:47.199" style="s2">work ethic and frustration tolerance are</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:48.159" style="s2">the ones and that can generate high</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.199" end="01:15:49.360" style="s2">quality content</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.159" end="01:15:51.520" style="s2">are the ones that are going to do well</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.360" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">in the digital age so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.520" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">for us economically to have good</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:57.840" style="s2">and so the question was how do we</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:00.159" style="s2">incentivize</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.840" end="01:16:01.840" style="s2">um yeah so that&#39;s that that&#39;s where i</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.159" end="01:16:02.960" style="s2">was coming from is in terms of setting</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.840" end="01:16:05.920" style="s2">up the incentives</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.960" end="01:16:06.320" style="s2">um using the blockchain using that basic</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.920" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">income</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.320" end="01:16:09.760" style="s2">award i kind of went around in circles</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:11.199" style="s2">and confused myself i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.760" end="01:16:13.120" style="s2">was there something specific that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.199" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">make sense to you about it or something</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.120" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:17.120" style="s2">um yeah yeah let me give you two</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:19.840" style="s2">specific critiques and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.120" end="01:16:21.040" style="s2">uh maybe a more general one first</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.840" end="01:16:23.199" style="s2">because of the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.040" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">you know way money supply works versus</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.199" end="01:16:26.800" style="s2">gdp etc as you point out there&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">relatively small amount</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.800" end="01:16:30.560" style="s2">of growth in currency per year you said</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:32.719" style="s2">two percent</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.560" end="01:16:34.640" style="s2">my own work says five to six percent of</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.719" end="01:16:36.400" style="s2">the money supply could grow each year</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.640" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">still a relatively small amount relative</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.400" end="01:16:40.560" style="s2">to any given economy even a</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">pseudo economy or simulated economy so</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.560" end="01:16:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a quite elitist</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.640" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">small number of people that get these</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.440" end="01:16:48.800" style="s2">grants</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">in the current world and is that what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.800" end="01:16:53.120" style="s2">really want is to be encouraging</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">hyper competition for a small percentage</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.120" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">of the kids</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.480" end="01:16:57.920" style="s2">rather than a more egalitarian way of</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.400" end="01:17:00.239" style="s2">cooperating to</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.920" end="01:17:01.760" style="s2">do the best we all can together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.239" end="01:17:04.320" style="s2">number one number two</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.760" end="01:17:06.480" style="s2">and this is probably the deeper critique</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.320" end="01:17:09.360" style="s2">is funny money that is not yet</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.480" end="01:17:11.120" style="s2">convertible to any other currency not</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.360" end="01:17:13.520" style="s2">useful for any transaction</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.120" end="01:17:15.199" style="s2">actually going to be an incentive for</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.520" end="01:17:15.840" style="s2">you know fairly hard-minded high school</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.199" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.840" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">looking together to put five bucks</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:21.920" style="s2">together to buy a six-pack on friday</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">right those are two great points so the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.920" end="01:17:24.640" style="s2">first point we&#39;re talking about only</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">high school so these are</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.640" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">out of if we can have a digital cash</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">system where the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">inflation is printed by by putting money</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.400" end="01:17:33.120" style="s2">into these kids wallets</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">high school graduates who are the most</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.120" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">digital native that have produced the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2">best content</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:39.600" style="s2">um based on these criteria if we put</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:41.120" style="s2">into their pockets</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.600" end="01:17:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s actually that two percent inflation</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.120" end="01:17:44.080" style="s2">or five percent inflation is even better</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.560" end="01:17:45.199" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not that elite</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.080" end="01:17:47.199" style="s2">especially at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.199" end="01:17:48.560" style="s2">system where cash needs to get into</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.199" end="01:17:50.159" style="s2">distribution for the you know money</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2">can&#39;t be useful unless it&#39;s widespread</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.159" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">enough that people</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:53.920" style="s2">if only one person has all the money</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">it&#39;s really not useful you want to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.920" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">it out to a lot of people&#39;s hands so at</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">of the system there will be a you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:17:59.600" style="s2">maybe a 10-year period where you have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">ramp up</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">to the monetary base and so at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">beginning of the system where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:05.040" style="s2">unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">it would actually be almost you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.040" end="01:18:07.600" style="s2">almost everybody gets a credit could</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">probably get onto the blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.600" end="01:18:11.120" style="s2">and get this incentive and then as time</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:12.080" style="s2">goes you would get down to that two to</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:13.920" style="s2">five percent inflation</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.080" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">rate right now even that two to five</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.920" end="01:18:16.719" style="s2">percent inflation rate once you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:17.840" style="s2">monetary base</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.719" end="01:18:19.360" style="s2">if you&#39;re thinking of just high school</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.840" end="01:18:20.719" style="s2">kids what percentage of population are</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.360" end="01:18:22.080" style="s2">kids graduating high school right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.719" end="01:18:24.560" style="s2">right that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.080" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">not 100 of the population right and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.560" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">two percent</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">of the monetary base going to or five</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:31.280" style="s2">percent is even even more exciting</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:32.560" style="s2">every year being printed it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.280" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">not that elite if you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.560" end="01:18:35.199" style="s2">you&#39;re just talking about kids</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.679" end="01:18:37.040" style="s2">graduating high school that year</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.199" end="01:18:38.320" style="s2">getting these incentives so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.040" end="01:18:38.960" style="s2">actually a lot more high school kids</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.320" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.960" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">you might think of you know just two</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">percent of a globe of a population</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:44.159" style="s2">globally</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">i ran the numbers and it was four</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.159" end="01:18:47.920" style="s2">percent uh using your two percent number</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:48.560" style="s2">about four percent would be able to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.920" end="01:18:50.480" style="s2">a 25</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.560" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">year ubi right so that&#39;s once it</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.480" end="01:18:53.280" style="s2">stabilizes for the first 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:54.480" style="s2">there&#39;s incentive for people to get</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2">involved earlier which i think is</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.480" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">interesting because it gets the system</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.000" end="01:18:58.480" style="s2">up and running</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">and then it would be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.480" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">exclusive to get on to it not anybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:03.120" style="s2">again anybody can get the credits and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:05.199" style="s2">the credits have their own value as gold</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.120" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2">standard credits but to get this ubi to</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.199" end="01:19:08.320" style="s2">get this basic income</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.400" end="01:19:10.400" style="s2">you would have to be in that more elite</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.320" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">group an elite based on how</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.400" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">diverse how much you can work with kids</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:15.600" style="s2">around the city</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:18.000" style="s2">not all kids want to do that work right</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.600" end="01:19:19.679" style="s2">to get this if if the criteria is that a</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.000" end="01:19:20.800" style="s2">student every zip code has to pass one</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.679" end="01:19:22.080" style="s2">of these credits</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.800" end="01:19:23.199" style="s2">to do that work you have to coordinate</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.080" end="01:19:24.560" style="s2">acro you have to be somebody that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.199" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">interested in coordinating across the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.560" end="01:19:27.040" style="s2">city and looking at data across the city</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:28.960" style="s2">of what people are doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.040" end="01:19:30.480" style="s2">to ensure that you get the credit and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">not all students are interested in</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.480" end="01:19:33.199" style="s2">thinking at that</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:34.640" style="s2">social level and i that&#39;s the thing i</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.199" end="01:19:35.199" style="s2">want to encourage i don&#39;t think we would</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.640" end="01:19:36.880" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.199" end="01:19:38.640" style="s2">a huge number of kids participating but</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.880" end="01:19:40.640" style="s2">i think the kids that made an effort too</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">for example if one of the credits a</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.640" end="01:19:43.600" style="s2">thousand kids in every zip code get the</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">credit then a thousand kids in every zip</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.600" end="01:19:45.280" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">get onto the blockchain and get this</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.280" end="01:19:48.560" style="s2">basic income now they get a smaller</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">disbursement because they&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.560" end="01:19:52.239" style="s2">that two percent inflation you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:53.280" style="s2">whatever the the system has to print and</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.239" end="01:19:55.520" style="s2">money that for that</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.280" end="01:19:56.560" style="s2">period but they would all be able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.520" end="01:19:58.080" style="s2">have part of it so</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.560" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">if it&#39;s very successful and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.080" end="01:20:01.040" style="s2">gets it right then they all get a much</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:02.480" style="s2">smaller</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:03.360" style="s2">ubi disbursement for each credit and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.480" end="01:20:04.719" style="s2">they would have to earn a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.360" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">credits to get a meaningful amount of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.719" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">the cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t have to be exclusive in</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">number of kids it could if a lot of kids</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">across the city you know get it it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.000" end="01:20:14.960" style="s2">it&#39;s in that term</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:16.480" style="s2">in that sense anti-bias that all zip</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.960" end="01:20:18.159" style="s2">codes are successfully producing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.480" end="01:20:19.600" style="s2">then a lot of kids would get this award</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.159" end="01:20:21.199" style="s2">and the or just would be worth a little</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.600" end="01:20:23.360" style="s2">you know or a lot less</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.199" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">now the point about the currency itself</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.360" end="01:20:26.800" style="s2">having no value</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.960" end="01:20:28.000" style="s2">i really think i mean i am a believer in</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.800" end="01:20:29.360" style="s2">bitcoin and i think if you make a</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.000" end="01:20:30.320" style="s2">bitcoin sidechain where from the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.360" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.320" end="01:20:35.199" style="s2">the coin is programmatically set to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:38.000" style="s2">number of satoshi&#39;s that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.199" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">and over time that um the value goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.000" end="01:20:40.239" style="s2">down that</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:42.320" style="s2">encourages people to get off their hands</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.239" end="01:20:43.040" style="s2">it should be a cash not a savings</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.320" end="01:20:44.560" style="s2">instrument</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.040" end="01:20:46.239" style="s2">so the number of satoshi that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.560" end="01:20:47.440" style="s2">over time diminishes because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.239" end="01:20:48.159" style="s2">printing more it&#39;s an inflationary</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.440" end="01:20:50.239" style="s2">instrument</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.159" end="01:20:51.760" style="s2">um it encourages people that are holding</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.239" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">these coins to get rid of them so if</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.760" end="01:20:53.840" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.639" end="01:20:55.520" style="s2">more and more of these high school kids</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.840" end="01:20:56.480" style="s2">every month are accumulating these coins</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.520" end="01:20:57.600" style="s2">and their credit</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.480" end="01:21:00.080" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have a bigger and</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.600" end="01:21:00.480" style="s2">bigger base of people to go advocate to</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.080" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.480" end="01:21:04.320" style="s2">coin exchange say hey accept these dna</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:06.080" style="s2">coins we&#39;re all holding them and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.320" end="01:21:07.920" style="s2">more people get them the more that</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.080" end="01:21:09.760" style="s2">public and the more the customers of</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.920" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">these exchanges will be incentivized to</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:12.639" style="s2">take these coins and then the coins will</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">have some real monetary value</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.639" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">but it will be up to the community of</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">people receiving these coins</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">so that the risk for the early investors</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:21.120" style="s2">of sweat equity</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:22.960" style="s2">they get the biggest disbursement at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.120" end="01:21:24.480" style="s2">beginning right because the system has</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.960" end="01:21:25.760" style="s2">to print a lot of cash in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.480" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">and so a lot more people are getting</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.760" end="01:21:28.480" style="s2">them and each one is worth a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:29.760" style="s2">because the inflation hasn&#39;t started so</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.480" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">the incentives at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.760" end="01:21:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s high risk but high return if these</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:34.639" style="s2">things do turn into cash you can</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.040" end="01:21:35.920" style="s2">actually get a shitload of money from</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.639" end="01:21:38.000" style="s2">your high school diploma</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.920" end="01:21:39.600" style="s2">if they&#39;re successful if they&#39;re not and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.000" end="01:21:40.800" style="s2">you never get them turned into cash</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.600" end="01:21:41.840" style="s2">you were part of an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.800" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">experiment taught you something about</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.840" end="01:21:44.400" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:45.760" style="s2">but the more people over time that have</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.400" end="01:21:46.719" style="s2">these in their wallets the more you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.760" end="01:21:48.000" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.719" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">community of people advocating for them</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.000" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">to have some real value and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:52.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s a huge barrier if we</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:53.520" style="s2">already define</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.000" end="01:21:55.280" style="s2">programmatically how many satoshis</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.520" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">they&#39;re worth the exchanges don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.280" end="01:21:58.400" style="s2">to do too much work to list them</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">and then we can start exchanging them</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.400" end="01:22:02.000" style="s2">and and because they&#39;re you know losing</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:03.600" style="s2">value over time as cash people would</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.000" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">have an incentive to transact in them</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.600" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">not to hold on to them</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:08.400" style="s2">i would say maybe interesting you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:10.320" style="s2">my advice from a</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">uh call it political rhetorical</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.320" end="01:22:14.560" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:18.080" style="s2">would be to sell the dna system</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.560" end="01:22:19.760" style="s2">and leave the ubi system for another day</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.080" end="01:22:21.679" style="s2">that&#39;s great because yeah absolutely in</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.760" end="01:22:22.880" style="s2">terms of being in reality the app that</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.679" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">we&#39;re building that we have coming out</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.880" end="01:22:26.239" style="s2">that i&#39;m playing with this week</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.480" end="01:22:28.000" style="s2">it creates these gold standard credits</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.239" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">first with a</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.520" end="01:22:45.760" style="s2">exist first before we can talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:47.440" style="s2">next piece but i do think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.760" end="01:22:49.040" style="s2">for us if we&#39;re designing an educational</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.440" end="01:22:50.719" style="s2">system to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.040" end="01:22:52.480" style="s2">measuring whether the system is biased</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.719" end="01:22:53.199" style="s2">or not and not creating another system</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.480" end="01:22:55.040" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.199" end="01:22:56.480" style="s2">you know gives advantage to rich people</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.040" end="01:22:58.480" style="s2">and then doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.480" end="01:23:00.159" style="s2">give any opportunity to leave an uneven</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.480" end="01:23:01.920" style="s2">playing field i think it&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.159" end="01:23:02.960" style="s2">us to think about that and to have that</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.920" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">in but you&#39;re right there are two</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.960" end="01:23:06.239" style="s2">separate systems</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:07.840" style="s2">and they will launch separately with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.239" end="01:23:09.520" style="s2">credits being first</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.840" end="01:23:11.920" style="s2">after being a bit of a fuddy-duddy there</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.520" end="01:23:14.560" style="s2">on the uvi let me go on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.920" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">and suggest that your your platform may</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.560" end="01:23:17.360" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.960" end="01:23:19.360" style="s2">a lot more potential for bigger</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.360" end="01:23:21.360" style="s2">ambitions than you laid out</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.360" end="01:23:22.960" style="s2">as you described it it&#39;s a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.360" end="01:23:25.120" style="s2">correspondence with</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.960" end="01:23:27.199" style="s2">the current high school curriculum but</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.120" end="01:23:29.199" style="s2">it seems to me the obvious next move</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.199" end="01:23:30.239" style="s2">is to change the granularity to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.199" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.239" end="01:23:34.639" style="s2">right instead of having to be equal to</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:36.719" style="s2">you know 120</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.639" end="01:23:38.480" style="s2">hours worth of civics be able to break</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:38.880" style="s2">it down into how does a bill become a</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.480" end="01:23:41.120" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.880" end="01:23:42.000" style="s2">and you know what is federalism etc and</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.120" end="01:23:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a bunch of micro</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.000" end="01:23:46.400" style="s2">credits and each school could choose</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.880" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">what its curriculum looks like</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.400" end="01:23:51.199" style="s2">in terms of macro credits and micro</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:52.719" style="s2">credits and it may well be that the 120</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.199" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">hour or 140 hour</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.719" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2">hell it was granularity is is not really</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:24:00.000" style="s2">useful in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">and that a different and fractal style</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:04.560" style="s2">of granularity at different scales</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.159" end="01:24:05.760" style="s2">may be the right way to go and then once</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.560" end="01:24:08.239" style="s2">you have done that</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.760" end="01:24:09.920" style="s2">aha this is the big play it ain&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.239" end="01:24:12.080" style="s2">for high school anymore this could be</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.920" end="01:24:12.800" style="s2">used for the whole world of lifelong</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.080" end="01:24:14.159" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.800" end="01:24:15.280" style="s2">right that&#39;s micro credentialing and</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.159" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">there are a lot of organizations that</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.280" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">are trying to do that type of micro</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:18.639" style="s2">credentialing they don&#39;t address high</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:21.360" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.639" end="01:24:22.639" style="s2">so i think if this idea is successful i</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.360" end="01:24:24.400" style="s2">do agree that people will take it and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.639" end="01:24:24.800" style="s2">use it in other contexts i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.400" end="01:24:26.639" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:28.239" style="s2">my expertise and my interest is</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.639" end="01:24:29.360" style="s2">specifically to end standardized testing</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.239" end="01:24:31.920" style="s2">in high schools that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.360" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">my life&#39;s work is um and to replace it</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.920" end="01:24:35.440" style="s2">with project-based</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:37.280" style="s2">uh evaluation or and i&#39;m a data person</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.440" end="01:24:38.880" style="s2">so data that&#39;s based on these projects</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.280" end="01:24:41.040" style="s2">rather than on standardized tests</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.880" end="01:24:41.920" style="s2">but yeah i think that similar things and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.040" end="01:24:42.480" style="s2">personally i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.920" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">come out of</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.480" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">this i think that other people smarter</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:46.239" style="s2">than me are already developing what</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:47.280" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about for the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.239" end="01:24:49.280" style="s2">professional</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.280" end="01:24:51.199" style="s2">work and maybe for uh before high school</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.280" end="01:24:52.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure and then in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.199" end="01:24:54.560" style="s2">size of the chunks of a credit i think</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.800" end="01:24:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a good discussion to have and</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.560" end="01:24:58.480" style="s2">the system is designed to evolve and</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.480" end="01:25:00.880" style="s2">grow over time and get better</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.480" end="01:25:02.719" style="s2">the way i launch it at you know at</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.880" end="01:25:04.320" style="s2">launch at zero at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.719" end="01:25:06.239" style="s2">zero state is definitely not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.320" end="01:25:07.600" style="s2">the best way um because</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.239" end="01:25:10.239" style="s2">the community will grow and get smarter</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.600" end="01:25:12.800" style="s2">without me so i i definitely welcome</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.239" end="01:25:13.920" style="s2">thoughts like that to see i i think that</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.800" end="01:25:16.000" style="s2">you know just like how</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.920" end="01:25:17.840" style="s2">facebook when myspace was out facebook</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.000" end="01:25:19.280" style="s2">limited the number of options and made</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.840" end="01:25:19.760" style="s2">everything blue and i think that that</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.280" end="01:25:21.520" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.760" end="01:25:22.800" style="s2">better because people wanted to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.520" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">what they&#39;re sharing their community not</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.800" end="01:25:26.000" style="s2">figuring out how all these different</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:28.159" style="s2">pages work and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.000" end="01:25:30.000" style="s2">about a uniformity for</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.159" end="01:25:32.000" style="s2">a high school credit what one credit is</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.000" end="01:25:33.520" style="s2">defined as that has of some value in</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.000" end="01:25:35.760" style="s2">itself in exchange</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.520" end="01:25:37.760" style="s2">for academic institutions but i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.760" end="01:25:39.120" style="s2">the system will grow and grow in places</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.760" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">that i can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.120" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s designed to do that so uh and i</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:45.199" style="s2">think that ideas like that will happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:46.080" style="s2">that i can&#39;t predict now and that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.199" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">can&#39;t predict now</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.080" end="01:25:49.360" style="s2">but you&#39;re absolutely right that this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.600" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">going to go in directions that that um</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.360" end="01:25:52.719" style="s2">i certainly didn&#39;t imagine and i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:54.719" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting one is that that</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.719" end="01:25:56.320" style="s2">fractal approach i um each one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.719" end="01:25:56.960" style="s2">credits could also build that into their</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.320" end="01:25:58.719" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.960" end="01:26:00.320" style="s2">in interesting ways so yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.719" end="01:26:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.320" end="01:26:03.600" style="s2">place that people like you will think</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.760" end="01:26:05.199" style="s2">about and develop things that i&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.600" end="01:26:06.960" style="s2">know beyond what i&#39;ve imagined</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.199" end="01:26:09.040" style="s2">well i gotta thank you this has been an</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.960" end="01:26:11.760" style="s2">amazingly interesting</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.040" end="01:26:13.760" style="s2">conversation you have made a gigantic</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.760" end="01:26:16.880" style="s2">probe into thinking different</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.760" end="01:26:18.400" style="s2">as old steve jobs would say and i would</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.880" end="01:26:20.320" style="s2">actually strongly recommend to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">audience that they go get the book</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.320" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">that what was the name of the book here</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:24.320" style="s2">education and digital age how we get</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:25.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.320" end="01:26:27.040" style="s2">and the audiobook is coming out shortly</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.760" end="01:26:28.000" style="s2">if you prefer audiobooks we should be</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.040" end="01:26:30.080" style="s2">out in about a month</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.000" end="01:26:31.440" style="s2">yeah my wife uh i&#39;m going to have her</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.080" end="01:26:32.880" style="s2">listen to the audiobook she loves</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.560" end="01:26:40.239" style="s2">i&#39;ve only listened to one audio book in</p>
