<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.089" style="s2">so since that might be unfamiliar for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:09.330" style="s2">lot of people why is it that even if</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.089" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">someone is eating healthy food they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.330" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">eating kind of raw produce or cooked but</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:15.500" style="s2">you know fresh produce even organic they</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">might have less micronutrients and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.500" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">specifically why is that such a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">for minerals well for minerals it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">can be pretty substantial our soils are</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">becoming depleted and that&#39;s where most</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:30.929" style="s2">of the the micronutrients of the foods</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">that we consume are coming from and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">see it and you know we we really focus</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">on organic foods and we&#39;re all excited</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">about organic foods and the health</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">components of organic foods but much of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:45.469" style="s2">the organic farming can result in even</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">greater deficiencies in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.469" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">micronutrient profiles of foods of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.539" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">vegetables because you Nathan can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">think of his last name but he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">kind of the big researcher into nitric</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">oxide I had a conversation with him we</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">were talking about the nitric oxide</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">content of kale and beets and things</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">like that and he had done a study on</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">organic versus commercially farmed and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">found that there was a significant</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">deficiency in nitrates in the kale that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">was organic relative to the commercially</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">farm because in the commercial farming</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">they were adding nitrates to the soil</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the plants were using so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:30.180" style="s2">we have to understand that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">that the fact that we&#39;re eating the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.180" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">plant but we have to understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:37.850" style="s2">the the environment that the plant grows</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:40.220" style="s2">in is going to be essential in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.850" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">micronutrient component that that plant</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.220" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">contains that we essentially get then</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the the aspect of glyphosate</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">with the commercially farmed stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">is a heavy metal key later which means</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:55.380" style="s2">it binds up to metals which are</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">micronutrients and the minerals and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.380" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">will bind them to the point where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">can&#39;t absorb them so it will take out</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:06.659" style="s2">positive cationic micronutrients like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2">copper zinc selenium those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.659" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">things will be bound up so that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:12.210" style="s2">absorb them and so you&#39;ve got to look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:13.530" style="s2">the bigger picture of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.210" end="00:02:15.330" style="s2">everything when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.530" end="00:02:17.550" style="s2">getting these micronutrients from food</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">and understand truly what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.550" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">and what you&#39;re not I think when I first</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">started studying health and nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">the book empty harvest by Bernard Jenson</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:27.080" style="s2">was one of the first ones that I read</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:29.550" style="s2">great where he went deep into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.080" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">effects of modern agriculture and mono</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.550" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">cropping and etc on soil health and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">decreased microbiome of the soil the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">decreased humic and fulvic acid content</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:41.250" style="s2">as well as decreased trace minerals and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">of course that comes through into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.250" end="00:02:47.460" style="s2">plants you know I for those who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">studied it they know for those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.460" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">modern agriculture traditional</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:55.620" style="s2">agriculture typically puts three primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">nutrients into the soil right NPK so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.620" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">the critical things potassium nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.660" end="00:03:02.490" style="s2">phosphorus that the soil absolutely has</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:04.520" style="s2">to have to grow plants but the other 70</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.490" end="00:03:07.020" style="s2">to plus trace minerals and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.520" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">microbiome and etc that are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.020" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">are not going in there so it can get</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">very deficient in that so you just</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">brought up one of the very few examples</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">that might be possible of if someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:18.360" style="s2">doing organic where they are not getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">nitrogen up high enough you might</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.360" end="00:03:21.990" style="s2">actually be low in nitrate I&#39;d be super</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:25.490" style="s2">curious to see the sample size and where</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.990" end="00:03:28.980" style="s2">he was sampling fromming on organics</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.490" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">because obviously someone can do organic</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.980" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">where they are not getting nitrogen or</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:35.490" style="s2">potassium you know or phosphorus up high</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.670" end="00:03:36.990" style="s2">enough but in general if they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.490" end="00:03:38.610" style="s2">turning stuff back over and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.990" end="00:03:40.230" style="s2">back into the soil the likelihood that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.610" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">things other than those three are much</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.230" end="00:03:44.520" style="s2">higher it&#39;s gonna be high and I think he</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:47.160" style="s2">actually sampled from three different</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.520" end="00:03:49.080" style="s2">states organic farmers from three</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.160" end="00:03:50.730" style="s2">separate states but I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.080" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">the use of the farm was or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.730" end="00:03:58.740" style="s2">that so we referred to organic obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:01.740" style="s2">more nutrients from a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.740" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">set of fertilizers than three minerals</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.740" end="00:04:07.110" style="s2">is one goal but really the much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">goal is avoiding the pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.110" end="00:04:13.650" style="s2">herbicides fungicides that they put on I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">would buy organic and supplement nitric</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">oxide any any day wouldn&#39;t you oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">actually take biryu crystals you know as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">a supplement to boost my nitric oxide</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:26.920" style="s2">levels</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:28.420" style="s2">since we&#39;re touching on it in case</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.920" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">people don&#39;t know what is the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.420" end="00:04:34.300" style="s2">of nitric oxide nitric oxide is like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.300" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">nutrients altogether it has three</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:42.610" style="s2">different really different separate</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:45.100" style="s2">components you have the the neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.610" end="00:04:47.230" style="s2">nitric oxide which exists predominantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.100" end="00:04:49.810" style="s2">in the brain and you&#39;re dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.230" end="00:04:53.710" style="s2">working as a neurotransmitter it works</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:56.290" style="s2">as a free radical scavenger but it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.710" end="00:04:59.110" style="s2">also swing the other way and and create</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">these peroxy nitrates if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.110" end="00:05:04.810" style="s2">balanced in keeping it in a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:06.940" style="s2">homeostatic state and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.810" end="00:05:08.410" style="s2">inducible nitric oxide which has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:10.450" style="s2">to do with the health of our immune</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.410" end="00:05:12.940" style="s2">function and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.450" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">endothelial nitric oxide which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.940" end="00:05:17.380" style="s2">something that really is a solid</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:20.740" style="s2">predictor of long-term cardiac risk and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.380" end="00:05:23.800" style="s2">it has to do with our ability to of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.740" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">vessels to really be resilient when it</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.800" end="00:05:26.710" style="s2">comes to blood pressure changes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:29.260" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.710" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">post ischemic events those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.260" end="00:05:34.660" style="s2">things and as far as the peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:36.070" style="s2">nerves go one of the fun things where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">think many people heard about nitric</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.070" end="00:05:41.200" style="s2">oxide first is part of its</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:43.750" style="s2">neurotransmitter role is involved in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.200" end="00:05:45.430" style="s2">transmitting sensations of pleasure so</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.750" end="00:05:49.090" style="s2">nitric oxide deficiency and then and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.430" end="00:05:51.570" style="s2">donea commonly go together well and on</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.090" end="00:05:54.250" style="s2">top of that people who don&#39;t respond to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.570" end="00:05:56.320" style="s2">erectile dysfunction drugs right they</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.250" end="00:05:58.450" style="s2">are almost always deficient in nitric</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.320" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">oxides so you boost their nitric oxide a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.450" end="00:06:02.050" style="s2">lot of times they don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:03.820" style="s2">erectile dysfunction drugs and those</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.050" end="00:06:05.350" style="s2">that aren&#39;t responding you give them a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.820" end="00:06:07.980" style="s2">boost of nitric oxide and sure enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.350" end="00:06:10.419" style="s2">they start responding to the drugs right</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.980" end="00:06:13.450" style="s2">we didn&#39;t bother selling it but we made</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.419" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">a really fun cocktail with the PDE form</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.450" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">pde5 inhibitors and nitric oxide</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:19.330" style="s2">boosters not fun stuff oh yeah</p>
