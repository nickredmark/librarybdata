<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">see where we&#39;re all at so how I think of</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:04.619" style="s2">going to sort of be a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">various projects we&#39;re together tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.619" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">itself is what we&#39;re calling the meta</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.619" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">getting a built to have frame working to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">work on that publicly so that other</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">people with similar projects can either</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.530" style="s2">learn or actually join two together text</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">so we can work together a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.530" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">cohesively and then that will expand as</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">we get more projects we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">start to see how we can really live in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:58.439" style="s2">game B check to see how we can take</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">these kinds of projects for example mine</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.439" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">and Bentley&#39;s are sort of their you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">some similar in like they both belong to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">the sense making space and in a game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">we&#39;d probably be in competition but in</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">game be part of the goal is to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.240" style="s2">can we actually work together as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:14.970" style="s2">benefit</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.240" end="00:02:20.890" style="s2">to get more out of it than we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.970" end="00:02:23.470" style="s2">being competitive in gaming yes that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.890" end="00:02:28.240" style="s2">our current project but together Tec is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.470" end="00:02:30.910" style="s2">also a user cooperative for technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.240" end="00:02:33.010" style="s2">so how do we create technology that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.910" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">helps us live and gave me how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.010" end="00:02:37.780" style="s2">create omni win solutions and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:41.140" style="s2">out all of that the governance the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.780" end="00:02:42.700" style="s2">financing marketing and so our first</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.140" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">project of the project we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.700" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">right now is the meta project of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:50.740" style="s2">projects because it helps do that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:52.210" style="s2">yes that together Tech is a was a tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.740" end="00:02:53.770" style="s2">cooperative and then we started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.210" end="00:02:55.000" style="s2">calling it like a solutions cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.770" end="00:02:57.810" style="s2">because that is what we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.000" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">is creating solutions with technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.810" end="00:03:04.960" style="s2">yeah and just to add that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:08.830" style="s2">shoot I just started talking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.960" end="00:03:11.170" style="s2">everything left yeah so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.830" end="00:03:16.060" style="s2">opportunity to practice and play at game</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.170" end="00:03:18.820" style="s2">be amusing you know are building things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.060" end="00:03:21.430" style="s2">that we want in that space trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.820" end="00:03:25.210" style="s2">non-competitive and then also it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.430" end="00:03:29.020" style="s2">opportunity to find a way to make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.210" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">living off of well make a living while</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.020" end="00:03:35.170" style="s2">practicing game be outside of game a as</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:38.170" style="s2">much as possible and then you know just</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.170" end="00:03:40.060" style="s2">because many of us like using tech their</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.170" end="00:03:42.220" style="s2">lives or can build it that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.060" end="00:03:46.450" style="s2">been tech focused so far but then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.220" end="00:03:48.610" style="s2">as jublee said you know anything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.450" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">that solves problems and gets the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.610" end="00:03:57.970" style="s2">closer to a game be space yeah in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:02.710" style="s2">mind it&#39;s kind of like as it as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.970" end="00:04:05.830" style="s2">entry point to any kind of projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.710" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">where you can come find all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.830" end="00:04:14.670" style="s2">resources in people people that have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:19.390" style="s2">resources be that material resources or</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.670" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">abilities where we can coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.390" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:31.910" style="s2">just to get our move technology forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:33.470" style="s2">yeah all in that game be space alright</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.910" end="00:04:34.820" style="s2">awesome I felt like a little bit like an</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.470" end="00:04:37.640" style="s2">ibn cafe I liked it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.820" end="00:04:40.970" style="s2">which is my project I guess for bringing</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.640" end="00:04:45.470" style="s2">projects to that at a project - idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.970" end="00:04:46.640" style="s2">cafe in communication peace does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.470" end="00:04:47.900" style="s2">have anything they&#39;d like to add to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.640" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">agenda I kind of put a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.900" end="00:04:53.990" style="s2">on it just cuz it was like but well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">but but I&#39;m you know I think if people</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.990" end="00:04:58.670" style="s2">have ideas we can sort of add as we go</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:05:01.660" style="s2">yes so we did the first part which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.670" end="00:05:04.040" style="s2">just introducing it together Tech is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.660" end="00:05:05.750" style="s2">then the next piece I had here was</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.040" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">talking about them in a project how do</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.750" end="00:05:10.430" style="s2">we we this is where I was confused from</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:12.290" style="s2">last week and forgot to re-watch the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.430" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">board meeting which was on the crab</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.290" end="00:05:16.430" style="s2">democracy channel and now we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:19.700" style="s2">starting afresh anyway so how do we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.430" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">our Friday medians to go do we want this</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.700" end="00:05:23.990" style="s2">to be again moving together tech forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:25.990" style="s2">like moving the meta project together or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.990" end="00:05:28.160" style="s2">do we want it to be a mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.990" end="00:05:29.540" style="s2">bringing our projects here so we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.160" end="00:05:34.540" style="s2">showcase what that looks like to help</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.540" end="00:05:37.760" style="s2">each other or is there a third option</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.540" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">and then and my mind is mostly the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.760" end="00:05:42.470" style="s2">one so like the III we need and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">end up with sort of multiple shows on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.470" end="00:05:47.480" style="s2">this channel for things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:49.910" style="s2">project raising and the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.480" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">brainstorming but I think having a show</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.910" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">and maybe it doesn&#39;t end up being weekly</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:57.290" style="s2">the actual final board meeting but just</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.650" end="00:05:58.790" style="s2">sort of do something as similar to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.290" end="00:06:00.260" style="s2">game a board meeting you know a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.790" end="00:06:02.390" style="s2">corporate world where you&#39;re covering</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.260" end="00:06:05.870" style="s2">the same important aspects and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.390" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">can add whatever we want because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.870" end="00:06:10.550" style="s2">idea is what does a board meeting look</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">like in game B it&#39;s sort of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.550" end="00:06:15.350" style="s2">trying to think of so whatever that ends</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:18.350" style="s2">up being however that that looks I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.350" end="00:06:19.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal for this meeting even if</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.350" end="00:06:21.200" style="s2">it gets moved around to different</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.250" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">timeslots etcetera whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.200" end="00:06:25.340" style="s2">calling me together tech board meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:27.830" style="s2">think should have some elements of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:29.720" style="s2">sort of like corporate governance but</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.830" end="00:06:31.910" style="s2">where we wouldn&#39;t need to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.720" end="00:06:33.260" style="s2">you know the profit-seeking aspects and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.910" end="00:06:34.550" style="s2">stuff like that a lot of game a would</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.260" end="00:06:35.100" style="s2">and there&#39;s probably going to be some</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.550" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">extra thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.100" end="00:06:38.610" style="s2">is that you never talk about an</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:42.750" style="s2">eight-game a board meeting that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.610" end="00:06:44.340" style="s2">come up here yeah oh that&#39;s what else</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.750" end="00:06:53.310" style="s2">ascribe to the agenda train will come</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.340" end="00:06:57.000" style="s2">forth so I drew you or you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.310" end="00:06:59.370" style="s2">the board the meta project right as</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.000" end="00:07:01.940" style="s2">opposed to the mastermind on our</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.370" end="00:07:05.130" style="s2">individual projects right for Friday</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.940" end="00:07:06.450" style="s2">right yeah and I think it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.130" end="00:07:08.010" style="s2">possible we should probably try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.450" end="00:07:09.750" style="s2">emphasize like the individual meetings</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.010" end="00:07:12.060" style="s2">so mastermind we can you don&#39;t sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.750" end="00:07:14.310" style="s2">define what that is and what the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.060" end="00:07:16.380" style="s2">and then if it moves around it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.310" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">just the the mastermind reading and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.380" end="00:07:20.640" style="s2">this at least for the first session is</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.110" end="00:07:29.760" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my understanding here</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:31.500" style="s2">mastermind that&#39;s sort of like the bolt</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:32.790" style="s2">conversation that Jubilee has in mind</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.500" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">which wants to be able to have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.790" end="00:07:35.790" style="s2">people come together and split out into</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">different groups and figure things out</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.790" end="00:07:40.620" style="s2">and then no not necessarily it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">like you and Bentley it could be either</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.180" end="00:07:54.360" style="s2">gonna be on YouTube and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">love to have conferences or APIs pull it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.360" end="00:07:59.340" style="s2">off but we need way more people before</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:01.830" style="s2">that okay I&#39;ve been calling those co-op</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.340" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">councils cuz that didn&#39;t like that seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.830" end="00:08:06.870" style="s2">a bit more okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:11.040" style="s2">descriptive you know I&#39;m a my mind but</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:14.820" style="s2">I&#39;m open to new ideas yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.040" end="00:08:16.110" style="s2">languages ELISA yeah naming things in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.820" end="00:08:18.510" style="s2">way that people understand what they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.110" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">without explaining it and not using game</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.510" end="00:08:23.100" style="s2">a language right possible tasks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:25.980" style="s2">well I think you can use it as long as</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.100" end="00:08:28.020" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of repurposing it like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.980" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">know a board meeting is I mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.020" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">really game a but I kind of is you okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:34.890" style="s2">so um to revamp from last week I believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:36.900" style="s2">Adriel you said you&#39;re gonna start the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.890" end="00:08:37.979" style="s2">YouTube channel which you did I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.900" end="00:08:41.340" style="s2">remember bently said anything specific</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.979" end="00:08:43.320" style="s2">that he was taking on and I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:45.469" style="s2">on the questionnaire which I did said</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.320" end="00:08:45.469" style="s2">nope</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.100" end="00:08:53.640" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t think I had anything so how</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.380" end="00:08:55.260" style="s2">do you know I did send out the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.640" end="00:08:58.650" style="s2">questionnaire we had 10 responses which</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.260" end="00:09:00.300" style="s2">is awesome especially since like 7 of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.650" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">those responses came overnight like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.300" end="00:09:03.900" style="s2">posted 11 p.m. I woke up to seven</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:05.550" style="s2">responses and I think the only reason we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.900" end="00:09:08.550" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot more than that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.550" end="00:09:10.260" style="s2">the algorithm makes it disappear right</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.550" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">people aren&#39;t constantly commenting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.260" end="00:09:16.910" style="s2">it then it disappears and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:19.530" style="s2">four of us all in the game be space and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.910" end="00:09:21.810" style="s2">we can boost each other&#39;s posts by</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.530" end="00:09:24.710" style="s2">commenting and liking them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.810" end="00:09:26.970" style="s2">should be what we&#39;re doing so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.710" end="00:09:28.620" style="s2">people who want to see these things like</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.970" end="00:09:30.690" style="s2">we&#39;re probably I think the biggest game</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.620" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">B project it&#39;s there like anyone can</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.690" end="00:09:33.210" style="s2">come participate can bring your project</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:36.060" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.210" end="00:09:38.100" style="s2">it&#39;s Omni when it&#39;s Angie by Burress</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.060" end="00:09:39.900" style="s2">it&#39;s all of all of the things on they</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.100" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually game be right that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.900" end="00:09:45.570" style="s2">aren&#39;t like the wiki and those those</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:48.150" style="s2">types of things and so I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.570" end="00:09:51.030" style="s2">ethical to boost the posts so that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.150" end="00:09:53.910" style="s2">they go there you can find them admits</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.030" end="00:09:55.470" style="s2">the ones that people are commenting how</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.910" end="00:09:57.030" style="s2">is this game be well you just made a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.470" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">game B by commenting on it and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.030" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">the algorithm and so yes especially with</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:06.860" style="s2">the questionnaire and if we write if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">write up a post after for the next show</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.860" end="00:10:10.890" style="s2">to boost it to just comment on it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">have a conversation with each other on</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.890" end="00:10:17.630" style="s2">there so that people will see it if that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.490" end="00:10:17.630" style="s2">feels right to people</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.880" end="00:10:23.400" style="s2">I mean yep and that&#39;s something where</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.700" end="00:10:25.350" style="s2">that might actually be a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.400" end="00:10:27.470" style="s2">meta project sort of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.350" end="00:10:30.090" style="s2">strategies is in these situations we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.470" end="00:10:32.580" style="s2">recommend you know like for example if</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.090" end="00:10:34.410" style="s2">Billy and I have a sense making up</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.580" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">council and we have opposed to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.410" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">that then the people in that council</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.780" style="s2">might you know go and like it and share</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:42.140" style="s2">it and the whole thing where it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.780" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">each group the goal is to increase</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.140" end="00:10:48.270" style="s2">visibility or things that actually have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">a purpose yeah and also like even on</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.270" end="00:10:54.030" style="s2">your Twitter or on other the same thing</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:19.770" style="s2">also be good for posts like that word</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:21.270" style="s2">them in a way that we&#39;re also</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.620" end="00:11:42.570" style="s2">algorithm for the questionnaire itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.899" end="00:11:43.770" style="s2">it was for something else that was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.570" end="00:11:47.580" style="s2">a questionnaire I think you did</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.770" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">something it wasn&#39;t a diversity um that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.580" end="00:11:54.270" style="s2">was the question whether we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:58.620" style="s2">different topics for to talk about every</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.270" end="00:12:00.540" style="s2">week or did you ready a cafe as more of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.620" end="00:12:04.950" style="s2">a incentive for people getting to thank</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.540" end="00:12:07.110" style="s2">you bonus for being my memory and it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.950" end="00:12:09.930" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to stay at the top of the game</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.110" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">be it just in the algorithm and those</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.930" end="00:12:13.140" style="s2">kind of things like I don&#39;t wanna have</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:15.390" style="s2">to post a new thing for the project like</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.140" end="00:12:16.770" style="s2">go to this one and fill out the project</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.390" end="00:12:18.029" style="s2">I also don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.770" end="00:12:21.060" style="s2">that questionnaire no but it&#39;s filled</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.029" end="00:12:25.110" style="s2">out by ten people we should also really</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.060" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">maybe make more use of the links on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:29.540" style="s2">site like this I think document so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:31.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t have it open right now but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.540" end="00:12:36.570" style="s2">documents and all sort of Vicki maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.740" end="00:12:39.270" style="s2">to put put our links there I&#39;m so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.570" end="00:12:41.820" style="s2">it&#39;s in a more stable yes I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.270" end="00:12:44.459" style="s2">totally makes sense like actually all a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.820" end="00:12:46.110" style="s2">different like sticky content see if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.459" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">can get added they&#39;re like different</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.110" end="00:12:51.300" style="s2">things that makes a lot of sense come</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:54.420" style="s2">you know on the wiki I think that leads</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.300" end="00:12:55.709" style="s2">to I I&#39;m there just to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.420" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">conversations because I don&#39;t actually</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.080" end="00:13:27.210" style="s2">right as new things come out right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:29.470" style="s2">the new show that I think will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.210" end="00:13:30.730" style="s2">popular in the game be space cuz that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.470" end="00:13:32.350" style="s2">the point is to find something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.730" end="00:13:33.970" style="s2">popular I just think it&#39;d be really fun</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.350" end="00:13:36.640" style="s2">to sit for an hour and brainstorm ideas</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:38.530" style="s2">the tech and solve an actual problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.640" end="00:13:41.470" style="s2">without actually needing to make it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.530" end="00:13:46.180" style="s2">coming to a new which is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.470" end="00:13:49.930" style="s2">show idea the new show but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.180" end="00:13:51.160" style="s2">there yet another project so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.930" end="00:13:53.170" style="s2">questionnaire what do we do with it now</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.160" end="00:13:54.850" style="s2">is on the agenda because I honestly</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.170" end="00:13:57.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know you thought we made it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.850" end="00:13:59.620" style="s2">then the mentor project like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.250" end="00:14:00.700" style="s2">actually get people not to project</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.620" end="00:14:02.740" style="s2">raising because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.700" end="00:14:05.320" style="s2">hard but to have someone get their</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.740" end="00:14:06.820" style="s2">project raised is easy to have people</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.320" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">come participate in raising other</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.820" end="00:14:14.170" style="s2">people&#39;s projects and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:16.390" style="s2">coordinate the co op ER councils how</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.170" end="00:14:19.420" style="s2">does that actually work like what are</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.390" end="00:14:22.510" style="s2">the ideas for Murphy right yeah and like</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.420" end="00:14:24.220" style="s2">how you get from having one person in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.510" end="00:14:26.200" style="s2">topic to okay but the second and third</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.220" end="00:14:28.360" style="s2">when do you start those councils how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.200" end="00:14:29.950" style="s2">we categorize them as a whole thing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.360" end="00:14:33.310" style="s2">do with how do we actually get those up</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.950" end="00:14:34.840" style="s2">and going and how do we Julian show to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.310" end="00:14:36.130" style="s2">the people who filled out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.840" end="00:14:40.210" style="s2">questionnaire and said yes they want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.130" end="00:14:42.250" style="s2">participate right yeah so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.210" end="00:14:46.270" style="s2">next steps are reaching out to them but</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.250" end="00:14:50.380" style="s2">also one thing I think we should do is</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.270" end="00:14:53.580" style="s2">take that data and and put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.380" end="00:14:56.290" style="s2">game be wiki and clean up their prod</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.580" end="00:14:58.330" style="s2">over the project page basically unless</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.290" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">they don&#39;t want us to but which I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.330" end="00:15:01.330" style="s2">they want contributors so I think it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.420" style="s2">be an issue</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.330" end="00:15:08.710" style="s2">and put all that data in a more</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.420" end="00:15:11.160" style="s2">manageable format would be one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.710" end="00:15:11.160" style="s2">do with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.230" end="00:15:17.170" style="s2">on that no I&#39;ve been playing with sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.940" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">of like the two different versions of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.170" end="00:15:20.070" style="s2">the app I&#39;m trying to build some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:22.750" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.070" end="00:15:24.820" style="s2">member portal involve bubble and nack</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.750" end="00:15:26.710" style="s2">and sort of playing with the tools there</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.820" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">so I think we could have something early</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.710" end="00:15:34.899" style="s2">days in one of those two areas pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.050" end="00:15:37.510" style="s2">soon and also building an app right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.899" end="00:15:38.680" style="s2">in bubble with a sign-in page and login</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:40.779" style="s2">and everything so I&#39;ll be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.680" end="00:15:43.570" style="s2">familiar with it I spent 8 hours on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.779" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">yesterday and ok 4 hours on it today so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.570" end="00:15:51.970" style="s2">I might so I might be a little quicker</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:53.860" style="s2">but also I don&#39;t want to duplicate the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.970" end="00:15:55.420" style="s2">wiki I mean we&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.860" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">there&#39;s okay to have duplication of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.420" end="00:16:03.160" style="s2">things but I hate duplication so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:05.320" style="s2">think for the most part the wiki it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.160" end="00:16:07.300" style="s2">too like even though it&#39;s editable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.320" end="00:16:09.610" style="s2">too static and it&#39;s not really great for</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.300" end="00:16:14.740" style="s2">data it&#39;s great for you know like an</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.610" end="00:16:16.180" style="s2">article the some of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.740" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">wiki their vision because badly and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.180" end="00:16:18.820" style="s2">were part of the call us I&#39;m sauce</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">Friday right that was with you know um</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.820" end="00:16:23.110" style="s2">is more of what we&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:24.820" style="s2">together tech not necessarily the meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.110" end="00:16:28.810" style="s2">project and how to facilitate projects</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.820" end="00:16:31.660" style="s2">but how to do more of the cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.810" end="00:16:33.310" style="s2">and I like creating game be through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.660" end="00:16:35.650" style="s2">nose like oh that&#39;s more of a platform</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:38.200" style="s2">to me or social media but that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.650" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">like the to kind of like are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.200" end="00:16:43.630" style="s2">interweb in it just started at the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:45.880" style="s2">versus starting with yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.630" end="00:16:47.350" style="s2">there will if we&#39;re able through there</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.880" end="00:16:49.330" style="s2">should be some overlap like what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.350" end="00:16:51.400" style="s2">whatever app is built and bubble or neck</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.330" end="00:16:53.380" style="s2">or whatever probably should have some</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.400" end="00:16:55.750" style="s2">like out linking to various pages of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.380" end="00:16:57.220" style="s2">wiki like hey here&#39;s the topic there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.750" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">not like because both programs are</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.220" end="00:17:00.400" style="s2">fairly simple as far as like you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">just sort of meet the after is not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.400" end="00:17:04.449" style="s2">of sort of you know built-in help but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.620" end="00:17:05.980" style="s2">you can probably add links that will say</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.449" end="00:17:07.449" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to use this stage and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.980" end="00:17:08.829" style="s2">have questions click here in the map to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.449" end="00:17:12.670" style="s2">page on the wiki that talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.829" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">thing so I&#39;d really want are you hoping</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.670" end="00:17:16.510" style="s2">to build you mentioned a login system</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:08.440" style="s2">little bit like what you are describing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.500" end="00:18:18.900" style="s2">as anyone by any chance looked at is</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.900" end="00:18:26.230" style="s2">yeah it seems like you can have a group</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.289" end="00:18:29.380" style="s2">and then in that group like a community</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.230" end="00:18:32.530" style="s2">and then in that community different</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.380" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">projects and then different members and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.530" end="00:18:36.789" style="s2">then people can basically sign up to</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:42.700" style="s2">work on different projects or so and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.789" end="00:18:45.789" style="s2">communicate and collaborate so I spend</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.770" end="00:20:43.920" style="s2">out-of-the-box product that like we</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:47.100" style="s2">could sign up for and start using for</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.920" end="00:20:50.970" style="s2">the expected purpose right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.100" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s like what you call a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.970" end="00:20:56.250" style="s2">drag-and-drop development platform and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a not a no code application</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.250" end="00:21:02.970" style="s2">creation so you&#39;re on the side that some</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:04.950" style="s2">of the some of the functionality we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.970" end="00:21:08.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be supported in something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.950" end="00:21:10.110" style="s2">a high low or a mighty Belle groups</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.100" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">which I imagine what is what hallows</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.110" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">like where they&#39;re pretty much kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:19.310" style="s2">social media replacement with some</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:24.450" style="s2">different it&#39;s not really social media</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.310" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">yeah and I can&#39;t even see from this how</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.450" end="00:21:27.890" style="s2">they support this project</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:33.060" style="s2">but yeah so I imagine if if we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.140" end="00:21:35.640" style="s2">custom functionality I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.060" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">high-low would which would be like well</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.640" end="00:21:45.000" style="s2">like you know having a project to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:46.590" style="s2">resource matching system so you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.000" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">have like these are the projects these</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.590" end="00:21:50.910" style="s2">are the different types of projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">there are and I here&#39;s my here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.910" end="00:21:55.320" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in and then it would</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.980" end="00:21:57.630" style="s2">created a matching of the projects to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.320" end="00:21:58.590" style="s2">figure out which ones I should join now</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.630" end="00:22:00.870" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.590" end="00:22:03.659" style="s2">that sort of thing I don&#39;t think how I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.870" end="00:22:05.429" style="s2">would support that no which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.659" end="00:22:07.169" style="s2">like there&#39;s so many amazing projects</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.429" end="00:22:08.309" style="s2">out there but if we don&#39;t own them and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.169" end="00:22:10.590" style="s2">don&#39;t mean the four of us I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.309" end="00:22:12.210" style="s2">humanity right like we don&#39;t own it we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.590" end="00:22:14.250" style="s2">can&#39;t improve it we can&#39;t make it work</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.210" end="00:22:16.590" style="s2">for our and as a person who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.250" end="00:22:18.659" style="s2">work on multiple projects I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.590" end="00:22:20.580" style="s2">either I&#39;ve briefly brief lived a pilot</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.659" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if they do what I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.580" end="00:22:23.250" style="s2">them to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.210" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">which is as an individual I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.250" end="00:22:27.299" style="s2">all the projects and I want my dashboard</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:29.159" style="s2">right I want to be able to like their</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.299" end="00:22:32.549" style="s2">designs so together Tech could have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.159" end="00:22:34.350" style="s2">community but but reasons court couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.549" end="00:22:36.510" style="s2">use that same community wiki lecture</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.350" end="00:22:38.039" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use that same community and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">we&#39;re not we&#39;re having to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.039" end="00:22:41.669" style="s2">marking and finance everything problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:44.549" style="s2">again and again and again for every</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.669" end="00:22:46.440" style="s2">project as opposed to creating the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.549" end="00:22:48.090" style="s2">matter project that is like wait if</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.440" end="00:22:49.289" style="s2">somebody&#39;s interested in reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.090" end="00:22:51.299" style="s2">their probably also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.289" end="00:22:53.429" style="s2">collection and they might do you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.299" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">like a couple hours of work for creating</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.429" end="00:22:58.380" style="s2">a logo for you and a couple hours of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:22:59.970" style="s2">works for you if that&#39;s their the thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.380" end="00:23:02.190" style="s2">they&#39;re good at and they wanted to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.970" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">with with who and it makes it easier to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.190" end="00:23:08.760" style="s2">volunteer or get paid depending on for</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:10.770" style="s2">the various projects and as a user as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.760" end="00:23:12.539" style="s2">set of months to be involved I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.770" end="00:23:15.179" style="s2">be able to have my dashboard with all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.539" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">those not sign-in and sign-out for wiki</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.179" end="00:23:19.380" style="s2">lection and four reasons for which seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">to but all of them are because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.380" end="00:23:22.140" style="s2">all about decentralization even when</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:23.429" style="s2">were talking about the wiki lecture for</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.140" end="00:23:26.220" style="s2">game B they&#39;re like and then we can sell</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.429" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">it to nuns in Florida like I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.220" end="00:23:32.700" style="s2">have one app but like that&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:34.279" style="s2">preference or if we want to compete with</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.700" end="00:23:38.520" style="s2">Facebook and I think we do want people</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.279" end="00:23:40.890" style="s2">then like creating it for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.520" end="00:23:42.750" style="s2">user as opposed to the community but</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.890" end="00:23:44.190" style="s2">with the community in mind is what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.750" end="00:23:45.659" style="s2">kind of need to do so I want to be if I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:49.230" style="s2">wanted to be part of the nuns in Florida</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.659" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2">and Big B I want mine to be all of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.230" end="00:23:53.190" style="s2">like it is on Facebook right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:54.990" style="s2">have to sign it and sign out to join</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.190" end="00:23:57.809" style="s2">Gabey or my parenting groups or my</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.990" end="00:24:00.899" style="s2">acoustic neuroma one I could just be on</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.809" end="00:24:03.510" style="s2">Facebook high/low may actually have that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.899" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">type of grouping smooth some of the text</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.510" end="00:24:10.289" style="s2">on there kind of implies that you a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.519" style="s2">person can be a member of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.289" end="00:24:14.830" style="s2">groups without</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.519" end="00:24:17.649" style="s2">out setting in but what I have it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.830" end="00:24:21.399" style="s2">confirmed that briefly looking at it it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.649" end="00:24:22.659" style="s2">does seem like if we weren&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.399" end="00:24:24.639" style="s2">go to the next step i lo would</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.659" end="00:24:27.159" style="s2">definitely be a great first step because</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.639" end="00:24:28.749" style="s2">it is the member community it does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.159" end="00:24:32.109" style="s2">probably has you know 80% of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.749" end="00:24:33.429" style="s2">that we&#39;d want on day one but a big part</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.109" end="00:24:37.379" style="s2">of it is just the ability to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.429" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">tweak it as you&#39;re build exactly yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.379" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">guess I think of it more yeah that first</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:47.259" style="s2">stepping stone that right for example it</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:50.679" style="s2">could be used in order for us to UM</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.259" end="00:24:54.429" style="s2">stopped the meet our project and get</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.679" end="00:24:57.009" style="s2">people together and down with those</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.429" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">people together build our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.009" end="00:25:04.479" style="s2">alternative if we decided that is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:06.609" style="s2">necessary I guess the question is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.479" end="00:25:09.309" style="s2">if for some reason no miss someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.609" end="00:25:11.349" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard of Facebook and they or may</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.309" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">not like they joined Facebook to be in</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.349" end="00:25:15.009" style="s2">game B and then they&#39;re on Facebook so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:18.879" style="s2">they join all the other ones is it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.009" end="00:25:21.729" style="s2">that where if Adriel brings people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.879" end="00:25:24.339" style="s2">the table for wiki lection are they also</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.729" end="00:25:25.839" style="s2">made available two reasons for right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.339" end="00:25:28.749" style="s2">all the other ones or does it just so</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.839" end="00:25:29.979" style="s2">happen that if that if both Adriel and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.749" end="00:25:32.019" style="s2">bentley get me to sign up for their</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.979" end="00:25:33.669" style="s2">individual projects I do believe get to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.019" end="00:25:35.289" style="s2">be on both of them but it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.669" end="00:25:36.940" style="s2">Jubilee signing up for my collection and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.289" end="00:25:38.589" style="s2">then because I know I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.940" end="00:25:40.690" style="s2">that they also show key reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.589" end="00:25:42.729" style="s2">right and anyone involved in it can</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.690" end="00:25:44.339" style="s2">write like are they giving me community</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.729" end="00:25:46.179" style="s2">or do I have to create my own what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.339" end="00:25:48.339" style="s2">think I understand what you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.179" end="00:25:49.719" style="s2">and what I&#39;m hearing is is it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.339" end="00:25:52.179" style="s2">Facebook where you sign up for one</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.719" end="00:25:53.950" style="s2">account and as many companies as want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.179" end="00:25:55.149" style="s2">sort of sign up for their own page or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.950" end="00:25:57.309" style="s2">community and you can choose what to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.149" end="00:25:59.589" style="s2">join or is it like Google Drive or where</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.309" end="00:26:01.029" style="s2">you need an account to participate but</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.589" end="00:26:03.429" style="s2">you can&#39;t go and find any document</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.029" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">somebody has to sort of share it with</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.429" end="00:26:06.849" style="s2">you to invite you to work together even</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:09.129" style="s2">though you&#39;re in the same ecosystem</p>

<p begin="00:26:43.510" end="00:26:47.640" style="s2">more than any other company</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.380" end="00:26:55.660" style="s2">yeah it looks like they do have very</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.940" end="00:26:58.780" style="s2">similar goals so I would say that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.660" end="00:27:01.930" style="s2">so they definitely do have posts from</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.780" end="00:27:03.850" style="s2">all your communities at once so you you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.930" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s more like Facebook in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.850" end="00:27:11.230" style="s2">way they may not have the surfacing or</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">finding of communities although we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.230" end="00:27:20.170" style="s2">theoretically do that separately</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:23.020" style="s2">temporarily I said I see the only real</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.170" end="00:27:30.580" style="s2">reason to start using this is if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.020" end="00:27:32.680" style="s2">choose to get off of Facebook well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.580" end="00:27:34.420" style="s2">not really on Facebook like I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.680" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">are we use messenger but do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.420" end="00:27:39.850" style="s2">like like we don&#39;t even have a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:42.280" style="s2">group right forty other tech for game B</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.850" end="00:27:44.410" style="s2">we do and that&#39;s kind of part of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.280" end="00:27:46.870" style="s2">right like maybe as our pool of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.410" end="00:27:48.550" style="s2">to be interested and we could also use</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.870" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">that pool to create together tech but</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.550" end="00:27:51.460" style="s2">like unless people join together tech</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not part of that pool and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:27:54.970" style="s2">the same problem if we join high-low</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:27:56.560" style="s2">right like are we bringing people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:27:59.530" style="s2">that to be part of that community in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.560" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2">connection yeah this our first yeah go</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.530" end="00:28:02.110" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.860" end="00:28:04.540" style="s2">it might be good if someone and yonus</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.110" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">you may want to take this on actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.540" end="00:28:08.290" style="s2">sign up as a member see what you see and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:09.910" style="s2">like is it Facebook ish where you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.290" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">just sign up as a member and see all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.910" end="00:28:13.390" style="s2">communities and search for them or is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:14.850" style="s2">more community-centric where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.390" end="00:28:16.990" style="s2">signing up as a part of a community</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.850" end="00:28:18.760" style="s2">that&#39;s all you see to sort of start with</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.990" end="00:28:21.190" style="s2">and then as you get invited you can just</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.760" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">reuse that that login does that make</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.190" end="00:28:29.770" style="s2">sense yeah it makes sense I am signed up</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:34.540" style="s2">already but I am apparently the only</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.770" end="00:28:36.700" style="s2">person there now did you need to like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.540" end="00:28:38.290" style="s2">sort of crater on space or is it like</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.700" end="00:28:38.840" style="s2">Facebook we&#39;re here to stop now a member</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.290" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">of hi</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.840" end="00:28:43.580" style="s2">and there&#39;s all these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:50.509" style="s2">communities that now you can join no</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.580" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean I think you see all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.509" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">communities and then when you go into</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">one community you see all their projects</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.840" end="00:29:03.379" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure whether you have to be part</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.820" end="00:29:07.009" style="s2">of that community first before you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.379" end="00:29:09.889" style="s2">actually see the projects but yes I</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.009" end="00:29:13.190" style="s2">think it is quite open but it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.889" end="00:29:15.499" style="s2">really tell and verify because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.190" end="00:29:18.710" style="s2">only person I don&#39;t know whether there</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.499" end="00:29:20.690" style="s2">are actually other communities or it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.710" end="00:29:23.509" style="s2">might be that there are but they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.690" end="00:29:27.950" style="s2">hidden and I&#39;m actually not the only</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.509" end="00:29:29.539" style="s2">person there which well I mean it order</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.950" end="00:29:32.029" style="s2">to sign up you have to hit a button that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.539" end="00:29:35.269" style="s2">says start a community right there is no</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.029" end="00:29:40.580" style="s2">creator down so you notice I think you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.269" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">had to create a community and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.580" end="00:29:46.460" style="s2">they&#39;re just terminology which is a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:47.690" style="s2">problem because how do we get like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.460" end="00:29:49.220" style="s2">guess then you create a community then</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.690" end="00:29:52.570" style="s2">you should probably invite people but</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.220" end="00:29:55.999" style="s2">then you have to invite people with I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.570" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">guess we can probably post a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.999" end="00:30:01.369" style="s2">around specifically a silo at a moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:05.029" style="s2">um I can keep an eye on it I look more</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.369" end="00:30:11.230" style="s2">into it but so what I hear out of all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.029" end="00:30:15.080" style="s2">this is that we want to have at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.230" end="00:30:17.119" style="s2">soonerlater at least this our own</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.080" end="00:30:21.289" style="s2">version of this where people can</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.119" end="00:30:26.539" style="s2">interact and find each other in the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.289" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">that we want to shape it and yeah where</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.539" end="00:30:31.129" style="s2">do we want to exactly so we have as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:32.119" style="s2">control over the roadmap as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.129" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t you know like oh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.119" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">missing a certain feature can we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:40.279" style="s2">that yeah well think about that in five</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">years which and to that point I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.279" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">100% sure whether that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.419" end="00:30:52.929" style="s2">at least in the stage where where we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.820" end="00:30:55.630" style="s2">right now the right way for what because</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.929" end="00:30:58.809" style="s2">there are so many tools that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.630" end="00:31:02.049" style="s2">probably facilitate the first steps</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.809" end="00:31:04.149" style="s2">already that and you know it for us to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.049" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">get to the point now okay good on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.149" end="00:31:09.179" style="s2">other Bentley and it really research</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:16.120" style="s2">that you played with bobland you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.179" end="00:31:17.740" style="s2">create something like that right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.120" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">imagining like it would take a year</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.740" end="00:31:25.690" style="s2">until we get to that point but if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:27.580" style="s2">say what functionality if you want if</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.690" end="00:31:29.559" style="s2">you want to replace Facebook groups or</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.580" end="00:31:33.909" style="s2">high-low it would still take several</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.559" end="00:31:36.730" style="s2">months but I don&#39;t think that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.909" end="00:31:38.049" style="s2">huge value and in that I think the main</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.730" end="00:31:41.649" style="s2">thing we want to do which isn&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.049" end="00:31:44.529" style="s2">anywhere which is a a skill and time</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.649" end="00:31:48.220" style="s2">matching with projects I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.529" end="00:31:53.159" style="s2">high-low has that yet I think if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.220" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">skill matching with projects with</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.159" end="00:31:59.860" style="s2">necessarily the time scheduling I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:32:01.990" style="s2">sure that&#39;s the thing it might have</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.860" end="00:32:03.669" style="s2">skill matching with in a community which</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.990" end="00:32:06.220" style="s2">I guess if we had a single community</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.669" end="00:32:13.929" style="s2">with multiple projects then yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.220" end="00:32:16.779" style="s2">that would work and it should always be</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.929" end="00:32:19.779" style="s2">free but that is a project maybe not but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.779" end="00:32:22.450" style="s2">then well there&#39;s my place sorry</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.779" end="00:32:24.340" style="s2">whatsoever yeah that&#39;s one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.450" end="00:32:27.009" style="s2">job it does see like sign up for free</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.340" end="00:32:30.789" style="s2">with the yeah but does it say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.009" end="00:32:34.029" style="s2">free yeah nothing is ever free game B&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.789" end="00:32:36.909" style="s2">not even free yeah if you&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.029" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">your you&#39;re the product right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.909" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">cuz we&#39;re living in a game a well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:47.620" style="s2">in game age we&#39;re not paying her the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:49.419" style="s2">process into it we probably yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.620" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">to you know at this point if I need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.419" end="00:32:53.620" style="s2">look at it see what does functionality</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">is and see what overlap this is because</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.620" end="00:32:57.309" style="s2">even if we don&#39;t end up using it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:57.940" style="s2">it&#39;s good to know how much overlap we</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.309" end="00:33:00.129" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.940" end="00:33:01.620" style="s2">and if we do end up using it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.129" end="00:33:05.080" style="s2">that&#39;s one less thing we have to build</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.620" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">although we do eventually have a concern</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.080" end="00:33:10.990" style="s2">on living if it ends up being kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:13.389" style="s2">game a product then eventually may want</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.990" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">to replace it but right I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.389" end="00:33:18.129" style="s2">it does everything what we want and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.870" style="s2">exactly if it can allow us to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.129" end="00:33:24.820" style="s2">other things and it can do 80% of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.870" end="00:33:26.230" style="s2">we want to do then it&#39;s probably good</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.820" end="00:33:28.090" style="s2">job yeah so I would be interested to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.230" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">find out about the the skill matching</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.090" end="00:33:30.940" style="s2">sort of across projects like if we say</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:34.149" style="s2">here&#39;s a skill you know for marketing</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.940" end="00:33:36.340" style="s2">and a skill for I don&#39;t know finance in</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.149" end="00:33:37.659" style="s2">one project say I need help with</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.340" end="00:33:39.970" style="s2">marketing a different project and say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.659" end="00:33:41.409" style="s2">help with finance and their new member</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.970" end="00:33:46.980" style="s2">signs up and says I&#39;m good at finance</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.409" end="00:33:46.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t highlight oh go over there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.850" end="00:33:59.649" style="s2">people find a purpose so um okay I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.620" end="00:34:03.399" style="s2">set that cost around high-low has</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.649" end="00:34:07.509" style="s2">apparently been acquired by holo</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.399" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">we already I think many of us are well</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.509" end="00:34:11.800" style="s2">holo</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:14.770" style="s2">I&#39;m already there also in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.800" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">space ish um a little bit not officially</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.770" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">but has been often referenced here um</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:39.419" style="s2">the holo chain hollow chain yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:39.419" style="s2">are it&#39;s based on the whole of chain</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.929" end="00:34:50.679" style="s2">anyway I can send send of the post</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.520" end="00:34:56.790" style="s2">around where they say more about it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.679" end="00:34:59.210" style="s2">base the firsts first lion and there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.790" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.210" end="00:35:04.010" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a web and mobile app to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:08.809" style="s2">help communities and groups communicate</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.010" end="00:35:12.470" style="s2">and collaborate more effectively and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.809" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">so it sounds like they are also in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.470" end="00:35:18.440" style="s2">beginning stage a little bit of you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.020" end="00:35:21.650" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing and I think it would</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.440" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2">make sense for us to try to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.650" end="00:35:28.190" style="s2">with them actually in our and see what</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.700" end="00:35:31.300" style="s2">their vision is maybe and and what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.190" end="00:35:35.300" style="s2">want to do it it sounds like we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.300" end="00:35:38.150" style="s2">probably going in the same direction at</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.300" end="00:35:39.109" style="s2">least the difference is if their whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.150" end="00:35:40.880" style="s2">load chain that means they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.109" end="00:35:42.589" style="s2">decentralized it means their block chain</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.880" end="00:35:44.089" style="s2">which means every one thing has to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.589" end="00:35:47.420" style="s2">that nail before they apply that hammer</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.089" end="00:35:48.829" style="s2">and at least my vision for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.420" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">is like will be own it together we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.829" end="00:35:53.809" style="s2">figure out a cola like if blockchain is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:54.920" style="s2">the way but it&#39;s like like and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.809" end="00:35:56.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t reach out to them</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.920" end="00:36:00.140" style="s2">they&#39;ll have a conversation because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.059" end="00:36:01.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we do but then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.140" end="00:36:02.630" style="s2">want to decentralize they want your</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.520" end="00:36:04.069" style="s2">community to be separate in this</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.630" end="00:36:06.200" style="s2">community to be separate and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.069" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">care that that you get one one dashboard</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.200" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to even know if they</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:10.730" style="s2">see the vision because it&#39;s like every</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:12.440" style="s2">like everything needs to be set</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.730" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">decentralized so that we&#39;re safe as</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.440" end="00:36:18.799" style="s2">opposed to right but we&#39;re not powerful</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:20.359" style="s2">then like there&#39;s something be said for</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.799" end="00:36:23.270" style="s2">doing things together as long as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.359" end="00:36:27.369" style="s2">done transparently and I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.270" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">that that being on the holo train</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.369" end="00:36:35.150" style="s2">necessarily means that you are separate</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:37.819" style="s2">so they are quickly ways where you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.150" end="00:36:42.290" style="s2">still have you know the the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.819" end="00:36:48.440" style="s2">and linking up of things and so it</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.290" end="00:36:50.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily exclude put me into</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.440" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">more are you able to send invites or</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.210" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">anything yours</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:59.650" style="s2">like how do you add something to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:37:00.790" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll check it out if you do find</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.650" end="00:37:02.470" style="s2">the way if you can message me on</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.790" end="00:37:04.090" style="s2">Facebook all you know send you my email</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.470" end="00:37:05.590" style="s2">or whatever it needs to send me the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.090" end="00:37:09.210" style="s2">but I&#39;d be interested to sign up as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.590" end="00:37:11.620" style="s2">member just to see what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.210" end="00:37:13.480" style="s2">all right is there anything pressing</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.620" end="00:37:13.900" style="s2">right now for together - Oh what was</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.480" end="00:37:15.430" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.900" end="00:37:19.180" style="s2">here&#39;s together tech just open any</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.430" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">window with us like we&#39;re going to we</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.180" end="00:37:23.380" style="s2">talked about the algorithm that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:24.610" style="s2">gonna go and like the questionnaire post</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.380" end="00:37:25.960" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really talked about Rick</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.610" end="00:37:27.910" style="s2">she&#39;s gonna do with that besides the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.960" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">winky put it on but we kind of need</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.910" end="00:37:32.050" style="s2">permission like someone permission</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">so maybe posting that in the wiki game</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.050" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">the Facebook group of like hey we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:38.140" style="s2">this questionnaire how do we get more</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:45.160" style="s2">people to fill it out and how do we use</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.140" end="00:37:48.430" style="s2">it on the wiki right yeah I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:49.630" style="s2">if a we could project within the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.430" end="00:37:53.410" style="s2">time would also be good check with them</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.630" end="00:37:55.120" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think the one</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.410" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">people asking permission before you go</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.120" end="00:38:01.180" style="s2">in or do things I think they want people</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:38:03.310" style="s2">to be she is my they have their projects</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.180" end="00:38:05.530" style="s2">right like how do we not dismantle that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.310" end="00:38:07.720" style="s2">and add what they have that is use that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.530" end="00:38:08.950" style="s2">we don&#39;t have right because we have 10</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.720" end="00:38:12.340" style="s2">people have been filled it out we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.950" end="00:38:13.390" style="s2">have 100 people filling it out or you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.340" end="00:38:14.980" style="s2">know what I mean everyone in the game be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.390" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">space that&#39;s part of the algorithm is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.980" end="00:38:18.100" style="s2">go in boosters so that hopefully we do</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:19.840" style="s2">get more I feel like if we have 25</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.100" end="00:38:21.250" style="s2">projects so be easier to be like hey</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.840" end="00:38:22.900" style="s2">these are all baby projects they have</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.250" end="00:38:25.150" style="s2">invented them but hey that&#39;s part of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.900" end="00:38:27.370" style="s2">is how do we met them what is GABP we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.150" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">all figuring that out is it Omni when it</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.370" end="00:38:31.090" style="s2">Santa Barbara is who owns it can I be</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:36.910" style="s2">involved in it it&#39;s in a podcast you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.090" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">know like what is what are the Wow what</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.910" end="00:38:41.050" style="s2">are the labels at the top how do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:43.000" style="s2">organize this and that&#39;s part of being</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.050" end="00:38:44.380" style="s2">part of kind of that conversation less</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.000" end="00:38:46.330" style="s2">about permission and more just about</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.380" end="00:38:51.700" style="s2">like how do we not undo it you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.330" end="00:38:54.040" style="s2">and add our stuff to it yeah I would I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.700" end="00:38:56.980" style="s2">would think and then the wiki it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.040" end="00:38:58.660" style="s2">quicker to just go and suggest the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.980" end="00:39:00.670" style="s2">change I think there&#39;s a way to draft a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.660" end="00:39:03.970" style="s2">change and then have them come back</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.670" end="00:39:05.710" style="s2">because I think 9 I think there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.970" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">know they&#39;re just gonna accept or</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.710" end="00:39:09.250" style="s2">whatever we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:12.790" style="s2">unless it&#39;s horrendous and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.250" end="00:39:15.849" style="s2">pretty swamped but I depend on you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.790" end="00:39:17.650" style="s2">who ends up having time to do that okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.849" end="00:39:19.690" style="s2">so yeah if someone couldn&#39;t just boost</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.650" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">the algorithm on the game be regular</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.690" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.410" end="00:39:26.950" style="s2">search for me and then the questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.240" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">was the one that was gained being quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.950" end="00:39:30.580" style="s2">liked for projects of projects I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:32.470" style="s2">even what I said because it was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.580" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">four or five days ago like I think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.470" end="00:39:36.040" style="s2">so I&#39;ll go add a comment just saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:38.200" style="s2">hey I added wiki election like just</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.040" end="00:39:40.180" style="s2">something simple like that which is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.200" end="00:39:41.950" style="s2">I actually said to do in the thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.180" end="00:39:43.450" style="s2">like and tell me who you are so I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.950" end="00:39:44.859" style="s2">match you with your Facebook profile</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.450" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">because some people don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.859" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">name and very few people commented um</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.230" end="00:39:50.980" style="s2">which is fine and like people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">read they just start doing you know and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.980" end="00:39:54.670" style="s2">so it becomes like that&#39;s I want the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.740" style="s2">algorithm to work in our favor so</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.670" end="00:39:57.580" style="s2">there&#39;s four of us and we can make that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:40:00.580" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.580" end="00:40:02.440" style="s2">I have less power that because I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.580" end="00:40:03.820" style="s2">one originally posted it right so and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.440" end="00:40:05.890" style="s2">like things it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.820" end="00:40:07.450" style="s2">missed it not one I can like your guys&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.890" end="00:40:09.250" style="s2">posts like wiki like should I always</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.450" end="00:40:10.330" style="s2">like it I don&#39;t know silly comments on</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.250" end="00:40:15.490" style="s2">it maybe I should pause I might as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.330" end="00:40:17.349" style="s2">but yes is there anything else for</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.490" end="00:40:18.970" style="s2">together text specifically is this what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.349" end="00:40:20.710" style="s2">like what are we gonna do next week what</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.970" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">does this look like going forward or we</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.710" end="00:40:25.300" style="s2">just so one of the things that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:26.890" style="s2">there&#39;s two things one at some point I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.300" end="00:40:29.710" style="s2">like to actually start the co-op council</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.890" end="00:40:31.869" style="s2">for four cents making so so badly and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.710" end="00:40:33.490" style="s2">can start to sort of guys reason score I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.869" end="00:40:34.780" style="s2">mean from what the small amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.490" end="00:40:35.890" style="s2">heard of it it does sound like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.780" end="00:40:37.839" style="s2">fair amount of overlaps I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.890" end="00:40:40.089" style="s2">interested to see how that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.839" end="00:40:42.609" style="s2">goes and talking about that specifically</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.089" end="00:40:43.900" style="s2">and then sort of the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.609" end="00:40:46.180" style="s2">conversation that I think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.900" end="00:40:49.570" style="s2">interested in to some extent which is</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.460" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">organization one of the need to trust</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.440" end="00:41:01.240" style="s2">the final product like all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:02.890" style="s2">different things that I think for pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.240" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">much all the projects I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.890" end="00:41:07.180" style="s2">some element of even if you know you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.790" end="00:41:17.050" style="s2">what I how would I like not really why</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.369" end="00:41:18.090" style="s2">would I find really far but then if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.050" end="00:41:19.980" style="s2">did finding this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.090" end="00:41:23.010" style="s2">trust and marketing and Finance are</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.980" end="00:41:25.260" style="s2">pretty key central conversations need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.010" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">have on all the projects like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.260" end="00:41:29.220" style="s2">get it made financing how do you keep it</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.210" end="00:41:30.600" style="s2">going how do you get people on it so</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.220" end="00:41:32.820" style="s2">it&#39;s sustainable is to get the money on</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.600" end="00:41:35.190" style="s2">it and then how with that how do we open</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.820" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2">that trust is a huge piece of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.190" end="00:41:44.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s really one that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:47.460" style="s2">gonna be well I think that&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.490" end="00:41:49.170" style="s2">not it&#39;s like exactly it&#39;s all like all</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.460" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">the things that you just listed do is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.170" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">become topics of did this meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">would say probably not I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:58.650" style="s2">might be me that might be like one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:00.690" style="s2">the you know if we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.650" end="00:42:02.040" style="s2">projects for project raising that one</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.690" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">might alternate between like project</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.040" end="00:42:10.020" style="s2">raising and you know the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:12.270" style="s2">like brainstorming yeah okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.020" end="00:42:14.130" style="s2">that session on that on trust whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.270" end="00:42:16.410" style="s2">channel that fits into I just think of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.130" end="00:42:18.360" style="s2">all of them this one isn&#39;t it and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.410" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">think the brainstorming protect probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.360" end="00:42:22.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t it yeah there was also so one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:24.360" style="s2">the people whose interest in doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.140" end="00:42:27.180" style="s2">project raising is an Australian Richie</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.360" end="00:42:28.710" style="s2">and like this type slot is way too early</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.180" end="00:42:30.390" style="s2">for him if you like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.710" end="00:42:32.430" style="s2">you know 3 a.m. before I got this time</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.390" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">it&#39;s even I know it&#39;s early for us as</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.430" end="00:42:37.260" style="s2">well but it&#39;s like even earlier which</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:40.440" style="s2">feels weird because I&#39;m a telescope but</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.260" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">I feel like that&#39;s different in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.440" end="00:42:44.580" style="s2">country I also might just be confused</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:47.730" style="s2">based on Murray Zealand isn&#39;t Australia</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.580" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">is right not the point um so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.730" end="00:42:51.450" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be moving project raising</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">consistently it would just be for people</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.450" end="00:42:56.430" style="s2">who truly can&#39;t make that time period do</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">we want an alternative time period and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.430" end="00:43:00.110" style="s2">do we also vote this one and then just</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:02.730" style="s2">have that one is let&#39;s say it monthly</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.110" end="00:43:05.940" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna also have one it like 2 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.730" end="00:43:09.530" style="s2">our time right that works but like 2</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.940" end="00:43:12.900" style="s2">p.m. our time on Saturdays once a month</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.530" end="00:43:14.310" style="s2">Network other people to join and then if</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.900" end="00:43:17.730" style="s2">we&#39;re doing I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.310" end="00:43:19.500" style="s2">alternating a project phrasing for</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.730" end="00:43:21.930" style="s2">someone else versus a meta project</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.500" end="00:43:28.040" style="s2">raising for us right like where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.930" end="00:43:31.110" style="s2">one thing if that works</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.040" end="00:43:33.840" style="s2">2:00 p.m. what time zone or is that just</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.110" end="00:43:36.270" style="s2">a throwing around side of your two hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.840" end="00:43:37.770" style="s2">or later so I think that before p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.270" end="00:43:41.550" style="s2">what time is it now for you Bentley I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.770" end="00:43:43.290" style="s2">can I bring its 143 yes the two hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.550" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">later so it&#39;d be 4 p.m. your time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.290" end="00:43:46.530" style="s2">I&#39;m not I just made that at the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:48.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not that&#39;s not the timer she gave</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.530" end="00:43:53.750" style="s2">me I just mean it has to be later in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.060" end="00:43:56.280" style="s2">day so does that time work for you yes</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.750" end="00:43:57.570" style="s2">okay I would think ideally he&#39;d probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.280" end="00:44:01.590" style="s2">want a bit later because I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.570" end="00:44:07.380" style="s2">still like 6:00 a.m. so earlier the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.590" end="00:44:09.540" style="s2">day so it&#39;d be Sunday too so for me</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.380" end="00:44:13.620" style="s2">actually right now is this meeting</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.540" end="00:44:17.790" style="s2">starts at 8:00 for me so for him it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.620" end="00:44:18.360" style="s2">two hours earlier than that&#39;s just start</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.790" end="00:44:23.420" style="s2">at 8:00</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.420" end="00:45:03.410" style="s2">yeah I think it would be better to move</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.610" end="00:45:08.130" style="s2">it a little bit more than two hours</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.410" end="00:45:14.070" style="s2">right it&#39;s 9 10 11 12 1 to 5 hours ahead</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.420" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">once a month for it to be to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.400" end="00:45:22.980" style="s2">of people ok yeah so then I think 11 for</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:28.590" style="s2">Jonas and 9 a.m. for that person which</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.980" end="00:45:30.540" style="s2">seems yeah which I assume in some way</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.590" end="00:45:39.420" style="s2">I&#39;m so you can just ask him but it works</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.540" end="00:45:41.080" style="s2">when I&#39;m on three yeah yeah so do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.420" end="00:45:43.390" style="s2">want to so we can have</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.080" end="00:45:45.310" style="s2">the other week we could try it and say</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.310" end="00:45:50.080" style="s2">the meta project every other week or we</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:52.060" style="s2">can do it once a month whatever people</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.060" end="00:45:55.930" style="s2">raising raising other people&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.070" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">and I think part of project raising</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.930" end="00:46:01.030" style="s2">should also be an invitation meaning</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.250" style="s2">what does that actually look like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.030" end="00:46:06.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know to be part of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.250" end="00:46:08.290" style="s2">project right like like come help us</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.310" end="00:46:11.800" style="s2">participate in raising the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.290" end="00:46:13.930" style="s2">on the other Saturdays but also if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.800" end="00:46:15.970" style="s2">can make this meeting even if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.930" end="00:46:20.320" style="s2">just watching and commenting or you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.970" end="00:46:22.030" style="s2">like what not a requirement but an</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.320" end="00:46:25.510" style="s2">invitation</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:27.970" style="s2">I think it&#39;ll actually be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.510" end="00:46:30.010" style="s2">once we get enough people interested or</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.970" end="00:46:31.540" style="s2">even some of us to sub out and be an</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.010" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">audience member I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.540" end="00:46:34.600" style="s2">interesting to try to interact that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:37.360" style="s2">see how that works see how the comment</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.600" end="00:46:38.740" style="s2">like has I have no idea what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.360" end="00:46:41.500" style="s2">to be an audience member for a live</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.740" end="00:46:43.090" style="s2">stream and how that worked and how that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.500" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">interaction works and you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.090" end="00:46:46.600" style="s2">feels like having to type your questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">and then seeing numbers like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.600" end="00:46:55.650" style="s2">sure I wasn&#39;t that in one of the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:59.140" style="s2">ones I say just a chatter and it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.650" end="00:47:09.370" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re always late with your</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.140" end="00:47:10.120" style="s2">comments to whatever I say so yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.370" end="00:47:12.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.120" end="00:47:14.740" style="s2">we have other people to swap in to like</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.520" end="00:47:16.810" style="s2">try it from the other side and say right</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.740" end="00:47:18.460" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t I&#39;m hoping this is game</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.810" end="00:47:21.340" style="s2">B and it&#39;s like we figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.460" end="00:47:22.780" style="s2">get a decentralized somewhat decision</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.340" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">making where it&#39;s like it&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.780" end="00:47:27.010" style="s2">people making a decision for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:29.080" style="s2">it&#39;s bring your ideas for your project</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.010" end="00:47:30.220" style="s2">how do we have an effective conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.080" end="00:47:31.630" style="s2">with a bunch of people how do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.220" end="00:47:34.570" style="s2">collective governance with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.630" end="00:47:36.250" style="s2">people not as much as you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.570" end="00:47:38.260" style="s2">me wants ownership part of me wants to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.250" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">make billions of dollars off of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.260" end="00:47:43.900" style="s2">don&#39;t I want it to work I want a tech</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.730" end="00:47:53.710" style="s2">board meeting a board is effective and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.090" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">so we don&#39;t throw the baby out with the</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:47:59.400" style="s2">have a board but how many people can the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.720" end="00:48:01.980" style="s2">board old fine if it can hold all our</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.400" end="00:48:04.170" style="s2">members we can figure that out I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.980" end="00:48:06.330" style="s2">once it&#39;s actually like an entity we</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.170" end="00:48:07.470" style="s2">have to find out like is there certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.330" end="00:48:08.820" style="s2">things or if the organization does</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.470" end="00:48:10.770" style="s2">something wrong the board members are</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.820" end="00:48:13.230" style="s2">the ones that are liable and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.770" end="00:48:14.849" style="s2">to figure out how whatever entity</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.230" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">together Tec ends up as a GIF it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.849" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">cooperative a society or what the board</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:21.690" style="s2">one might actually be a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">that like that one&#39;s not a swappable</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.690" end="00:48:25.650" style="s2">because these are the people who if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">know together in fact bricks the law</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.650" end="00:48:28.440" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones going to jail so</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.450" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that can you know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.440" end="00:48:31.710" style="s2">have the veto power like I know you guys</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.450" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">voted for that but I don&#39;t want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.710" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">jail so no right right and that is how</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:40.950" style="s2">it works I know the board is probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.150" end="00:48:42.510" style="s2">just like any other board responsible</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.950" end="00:48:44.130" style="s2">but also the membership owns it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.510" end="00:48:47.070" style="s2">they&#39;re responsible to the board like it</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.130" end="00:48:48.690" style="s2">or names so yeah the idea is that to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.070" end="00:48:50.609" style="s2">some degree the board is less</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.690" end="00:48:52.680" style="s2">responsible than in other regular</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.609" end="00:48:54.359" style="s2">corporations because we&#39;re transparent</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.680" end="00:48:56.760" style="s2">and because we&#39;re doing it in that way</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.359" end="00:48:58.020" style="s2">where it&#39;s like anyone like if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.760" end="00:49:00.450" style="s2">public suing us</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.020" end="00:49:03.660" style="s2">yes we&#39;re responsible if it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.450" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">membership suing us no like you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.660" end="00:49:08.010" style="s2">as responsible right I&#39;d like clean that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:11.070" style="s2">out at legal terms look like you could</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.010" end="00:49:14.040" style="s2">have also so much worried about like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.070" end="00:49:15.300" style="s2">suing so much as the like there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.040" end="00:49:16.589" style="s2">to be a lot of people in positions of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.300" end="00:49:18.390" style="s2">power that if this works are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.589" end="00:49:20.490" style="s2">fairly upset with us and we&#39;ll do things</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.390" end="00:49:23.220" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s trying to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.490" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">that like wherever possible we know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.220" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">bounds were playing within if we can say</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:31.080" style="s2">if it&#39;s a membership driven co-op then</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:32.970" style="s2">you know the board isn&#39;t as liable or at</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.080" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">all then it might be completely fluid</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.970" end="00:49:37.980" style="s2">yeah yeah and we have to work within</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.690" style="s2">game a to create game that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.980" end="00:49:41.849" style="s2">figuring all of that out and doing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.690" end="00:49:45.510" style="s2">transparently which puts a bit more risk</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.849" end="00:49:46.680" style="s2">and less risk at the same time by</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.510" end="00:49:48.270" style="s2">guaranteed we&#39;re gonna pierce the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.680" end="00:49:49.859" style="s2">corporate veil it&#39;s nearly impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.270" end="00:49:51.210" style="s2">not when you have my board meetings and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.859" end="00:49:53.430" style="s2">so that puts us financially responsible</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.210" end="00:49:54.810" style="s2">but like in no way is there any finances</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.430" end="00:49:56.070" style="s2">on the line you in any way so how we</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.810" end="00:49:57.570" style="s2">need to have the conversations before</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.070" end="00:49:59.940" style="s2">that happens of how don&#39;t you pierce the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.570" end="00:50:01.800" style="s2">corporate veil in a live board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.940" end="00:50:04.099" style="s2">when we&#39;re board members spitballing</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.800" end="00:50:06.180" style="s2">ideas it&#39;s like or we can serve you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.099" end="00:50:06.770" style="s2">doing this thing and someone&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.180" end="00:50:08.450" style="s2">actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.770" end="00:50:09.800" style="s2">we know when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.450" end="00:50:11.300" style="s2">piercing the corporate veil do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.800" end="00:50:12.830" style="s2">like the fact that most board meetings</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.300" end="00:50:16.820" style="s2">for corporations are closed and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.830" end="00:50:20.300" style="s2">opening that up and when you incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.820" end="00:50:21.980" style="s2">as a corporation you&#39;re the corporation</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.300" end="00:50:23.660" style="s2">is the thing taking everything on right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.980" end="00:50:25.190" style="s2">so they&#39;re the ones take financial risk</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.660" end="00:50:26.810" style="s2">are the ones to go in the legal risk and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.190" end="00:50:29.420" style="s2">since you can&#39;t send a corporation to</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.810" end="00:50:33.080" style="s2">jail unless the board does actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.420" end="00:50:35.840" style="s2">illegal things you it&#39;s the like entity</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.080" end="00:50:37.070" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of tried not the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.840" end="00:50:40.190" style="s2">but if you pierce the corporate veil</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.070" end="00:50:42.770" style="s2">which is like me be like Jubilee is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:45.020" style="s2">doing instead of together Tech is doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:48.740" style="s2">and even literally just saying it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.020" end="00:50:50.600" style="s2">that way like is can be enough right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.740" end="00:50:52.220" style="s2">so you&#39;re effectively incorporated for</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.600" end="00:50:55.340" style="s2">no reason because now you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.220" end="00:50:56.630" style="s2">right but yeah exactly so if it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.340" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">monetary thing you would see the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.630" end="00:51:01.210" style="s2">corporation because the corporation has</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:03.590" style="s2">more money but like with the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.210" end="00:51:05.360" style="s2">oxycontin the like those lawsuits</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.590" end="00:51:06.740" style="s2">there&#39;s actually more members that have</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.360" end="00:51:08.090" style="s2">been going to jail cuz they&#39;ve been like</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.740" end="00:51:09.650" style="s2">oh we found out that you knew what you</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.090" end="00:51:11.990" style="s2">were doing and and it&#39;s that to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.650" end="00:51:15.860" style="s2">money and kill people off to jail you go</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.990" end="00:51:17.750" style="s2">right right and so that&#39;s like when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.860" end="00:51:19.850" style="s2">do illegal activity as a board</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:22.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve already pierced the veil but if</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.850" end="00:51:24.560" style="s2">you do things that are that like in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.160" end="00:51:26.750" style="s2">between like let&#39;s say you you create a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.560" end="00:51:28.760" style="s2">product and you didn&#39;t do it maliciously</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.750" end="00:51:30.590" style="s2">but it needs to be recalled that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.760" end="00:51:32.840" style="s2">recall it that people died the board</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.590" end="00:51:34.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go to jail right it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.840" end="00:51:35.840" style="s2">that was within our capacity we did</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.610" end="00:51:38.630" style="s2">everything we could we found no</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.840" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">insurance we have all of this but there</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.630" end="00:51:42.470" style="s2">can still be a point where if they can</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.330" style="s2">prove you pierce the corporate veil but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.470" end="00:51:47.150" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the board that goes to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.330" end="00:51:49.400" style="s2">jail and not the corporation that&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.150" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">sued into because it&#39;s but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.400" end="00:51:53.660" style="s2">reason corporations were created was to</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">not pass that financial and legal risk</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.660" end="00:51:57.790" style="s2">on to the board members and on to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:52:00.560" style="s2">people like the difference if you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.790" end="00:52:03.110" style="s2">wow sole proprietorship or a partnership</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.560" end="00:52:08.300" style="s2">and a corporation is that is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.110" end="00:52:09.350" style="s2">not actually the limited that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.300" end="00:52:12.770" style="s2">where you no longer have limited</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.350" end="00:52:15.710" style="s2">liability once you&#39;ve pierced it okay is</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.770" end="00:52:18.490" style="s2">that actually a term like in that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.710" end="00:52:18.490" style="s2">that space Oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.510" end="00:52:22.780" style="s2">and so and I don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.490" end="00:52:25.960" style="s2">that looks like but I remember reading</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.780" end="00:52:27.340" style="s2">all about about it in my reading days so</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.960" end="00:52:29.260" style="s2">I did we only have like eight minutes</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.340" end="00:52:31.360" style="s2">left I just wanted to bring up the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.260" end="00:52:34.830" style="s2">for the new show and kind of get the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.360" end="00:52:38.050" style="s2">okay to try it and run with it which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.830" end="00:52:40.840" style="s2">creating an hour show weekly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.050" end="00:52:44.020" style="s2">know when it will be that is basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.840" end="00:52:46.740" style="s2">just problem solving solutions with tech</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.020" end="00:52:48.730" style="s2">but without ever creating anything so</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.740" end="00:52:49.990" style="s2">let&#39;s say you know you had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.730" end="00:52:50.920" style="s2">people together and talk about food and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.990" end="00:52:52.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re currently doing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.920" end="00:52:53.890" style="s2">currently being done for food what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.120" end="00:52:55.300" style="s2">want it what would we want to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.890" end="00:52:56.770" style="s2">same what is good about our current</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.300" end="00:52:58.450" style="s2">system for food and what is bad about</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.770" end="00:53:00.190" style="s2">her for ancestor for food what could it</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.450" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">look like in game be here in 10 years in</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.190" end="00:53:04.780" style="s2">the future and then what could we do now</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:06.550" style="s2">right if we had a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.780" end="00:53:08.560" style="s2">dollars and ten thousand people what</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.550" end="00:53:10.360" style="s2">would be possible because then that show</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.560" end="00:53:12.910" style="s2">KC and I think for the regular everyday</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.360" end="00:53:14.140" style="s2">public one they could be involved in</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.910" end="00:53:16.540" style="s2">having that conversation they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.140" end="00:53:18.670" style="s2">to have a technical degree right to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.540" end="00:53:20.140" style="s2">talking about that and just that there</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.670" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">are solutions at all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.140" end="00:53:24.610" style="s2">places and that&#39;s where my mind wants to</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:26.440" style="s2">Kiko like that is basically why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.610" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">creating together tech is so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.440" end="00:53:30.340" style="s2">sit and have conversations on how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:34.420" style="s2">create solutions and so to just do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.340" end="00:53:36.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.420" end="00:53:39.010" style="s2">I did want to give a little feedback I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.790" end="00:53:40.600" style="s2">think you might even just say come up</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.010" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">with solutions and just leave out the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.600" end="00:53:45.400" style="s2">with tech I mean I know all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:46.600" style="s2">solutions end up having some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.400" end="00:53:51.340" style="s2">tech a lot of people think digital</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.600" end="00:54:07.780" style="s2">solutions which I just I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.340" end="00:54:10.300" style="s2">need that qualifier but I&#39;m not in tech</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.780" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">right great</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.300" end="00:54:16.390" style="s2">no idea how to code it but like can save</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:18.460" style="s2">the world no problems because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.390" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2">not bound like things like the trust</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.460" end="00:54:22.990" style="s2">conversation might actually be that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:25.090" style="s2">might actually hit there if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.990" end="00:54:26.620" style="s2">solely about tech and it&#39;s about like</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.090" end="00:54:28.120" style="s2">trying to solve problems because part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.620" end="00:54:30.370" style="s2">the trust conversation there there will</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.120" end="00:54:31.690" style="s2">be some tech there will be some like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.370" end="00:54:33.270" style="s2">know what how does the corporation</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.690" end="00:54:35.490" style="s2">operate one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.270" end="00:54:37.500" style="s2">the corporate values or however that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.490" end="00:54:39.990" style="s2">conversation goes undoubtedly some of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.500" end="00:54:41.670" style="s2">will be tech but I think end goal is an</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.990" end="00:54:44.420" style="s2">inherently tech or not tech it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.670" end="00:54:44.420" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.430" end="00:54:49.350" style="s2">like the idea cafe we&#39;re like us in no</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.580" end="00:54:51.120" style="s2">way have to join in right it&#39;s just its</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.350" end="00:54:54.150" style="s2">own channel in its own it will be on</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.120" end="00:54:56.670" style="s2">this channel but is it something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.150" end="00:55:00.300" style="s2">any of you desperately want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.670" end="00:55:02.460" style="s2">participate in I like America because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.300" end="00:55:03.990" style="s2">can&#39;t have it on the weekends it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.460" end="00:55:05.850" style="s2">be something that&#39;s on the weekend</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.990" end="00:55:08.550" style="s2">because I&#39;ve already dedicated this time</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.850" end="00:55:10.410" style="s2">and I have a kid and I have all week to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.550" end="00:55:13.740" style="s2">do things but not necessarily on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.410" end="00:55:15.510" style="s2">weekends but I&#39;m open to doing it early</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.740" end="00:55:18.090" style="s2">in the morning like 6:00 a.m. so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.510" end="00:55:19.320" style="s2">before work for like you or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.090" end="00:55:21.930" style="s2">that&#39;ll make an 8 a.m. for you mentally</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.320" end="00:55:24.690" style="s2">so even possibly earlier which me but</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.930" end="00:55:27.330" style="s2">like I can get up at 5 a.m. once a week</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.690" end="00:55:29.000" style="s2">and have a conversation how to create a</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.330" end="00:55:31.500" style="s2">better world</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.000" end="00:55:34.430" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s coordinating the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.500" end="00:55:36.660" style="s2">time or it could be a floating time I</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.430" end="00:55:39.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know my schedules pretty flexible</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.660" end="00:55:41.880" style="s2">I and I it sounds like something I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.660" end="00:55:43.050" style="s2">like to participate although I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.880" end="00:55:45.590" style="s2">easily getting to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.050" end="00:55:45.590" style="s2">overcommitted</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:53.880" style="s2">yeah I mean it might work maybe to start</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.410" end="00:55:55.380" style="s2">with like it sounds like because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.880" end="00:55:57.660" style="s2">not tech and it&#39;s more just about trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.380" end="00:56:00.180" style="s2">to solve problems maybe it&#39;s becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.660" end="00:56:01.410" style="s2">alternate timeslot in the project</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.180" end="00:56:03.360" style="s2">raising so we got project raising this</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.410" end="00:56:04.590" style="s2">project raising this until we get more</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.360" end="00:56:06.180" style="s2">of an audience we could figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.590" end="00:56:07.800" style="s2">people like what people are watching and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.180" end="00:56:09.450" style="s2">then figure out oh look we have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.800" end="00:56:11.400" style="s2">audience for this Oh half them are in</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.450" end="00:56:12.990" style="s2">Australia let&#39;s do two sessions let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.400" end="00:56:15.450" style="s2">one you know men and one later so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.990" end="00:56:18.270" style="s2">we can start to yeah especially we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.450" end="00:56:22.050" style="s2">have to like the four of us don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.270" end="00:56:24.120" style="s2">to be in both of them but I yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.050" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">totally and is it you&#39;ll end up with</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.120" end="00:56:28.140" style="s2">like moderators were probably one of us</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:31.440" style="s2">will but I&#39;m fine with either so it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:56:31.440" end="00:56:35.430" style="s2">guys are gonna thought like it would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.670" end="00:56:39.030" style="s2">instead of doing the meta projects we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.430" end="00:56:40.770" style="s2">doing this or it could be project</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.030" end="00:56:42.750" style="s2">raising project raising one meta project</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.770" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">a month and then one this a month but I</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.750" end="00:56:46.380" style="s2">also want to be doing this week like for</p>

<p begin="00:57:07.950" end="00:57:15.270" style="s2">anyone up I think that still broadly</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.170" end="00:57:17.510" style="s2">plenty more if I remember the comments</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.270" end="00:57:20.550" style="s2">there were there were quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.510" end="00:57:22.470" style="s2">projects and I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.550" end="00:57:24.570" style="s2">gone already through all of them but</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.470" end="00:57:26.070" style="s2">yeah there was a few at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.570" end="00:57:27.480" style="s2">that yeah contacted them in the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.070" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">aren&#39;t interested they never got back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.480" end="00:57:32.280" style="s2">me other people who I have contacted and</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:34.290" style="s2">so I think I would need to post it you</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.290" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">algorithm to just get it better and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.880" end="00:57:40.800" style="s2">just kind of Marini them what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:42.870" style="s2">doing like hey you bring an aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.800" end="00:57:45.420" style="s2">and doing this but also that invitation</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.870" end="00:57:46.740" style="s2">piece is like coming to be part of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.420" end="00:57:50.370" style="s2">what could we do for you and what can</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.740" end="00:57:52.290" style="s2">you do for us mm-hmm I think if there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.370" end="00:57:54.540" style="s2">any kind of a lot we can also breathe as</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.290" end="00:57:56.250" style="s2">a previous projects because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.540" end="00:57:57.900" style="s2">like a project just needs to get and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.250" end="00:57:59.100" style="s2">freeze once if you rigged it once you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.900" end="00:58:00.510" style="s2">solve that problem great what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.100" end="00:58:02.550" style="s2">next problem because there&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.510" end="00:58:04.050" style="s2">people we want to do so here what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.550" end="00:58:06.630" style="s2">instead of getting a new project every</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.050" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">time to go and have three-peat ones for</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.630" end="00:58:10.830" style="s2">that very reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:12.330" style="s2">yeah so I with all of that I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.830" end="00:58:14.490" style="s2">sounds like that&#39;s also a thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.330" end="00:58:16.680" style="s2">a lot of content I know we already</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.490" end="00:58:19.640" style="s2">discussed this but maybe that should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:22.500" style="s2">every week instead of every other week</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.640" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">and then thing else who want to do go at</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.500" end="00:58:28.500" style="s2">a different time for the like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:30.360" style="s2">revisiting the the reasons no just just</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.500" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">the project ratings and the revisiting</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.360" end="00:58:33.450" style="s2">project Racing&#39;s because I think we</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:36.210" style="s2">talked about alternating it with</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.450" end="00:58:37.650" style="s2">something else right and I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.210" end="00:58:41.370" style="s2">we don&#39;t alter paid it with something</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.650" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">else the issue is I&#39;m fine with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.370" end="00:58:50.520" style="s2">except then you can&#39;t be on the weekends</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:52.230" style="s2">I can move it yes what&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.520" end="00:58:55.980" style="s2">project that we&#39;re gonna alternate it</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.230" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">with the matter project good like so</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.980" end="00:59:01.010" style="s2">what are we together so what are we</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:03.510" style="s2">doing with this time then</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.010" end="00:59:05.220" style="s2">yeah we can alternate this I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.510" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">that we need a board meeting every week</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.220" end="00:59:11.730" style="s2">or a mini every week so I think Ord</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">meaning meta projects every other week</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.730" end="00:59:16.290" style="s2">so having like a brainstorming here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">and so therefore how do we decide what</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.290" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">our aspiration is for that week and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:24.900" style="s2">like next we could talk about trust</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:27.270" style="s2">right or do that and then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.900" end="00:59:29.700" style="s2">then the other of the new show that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.270" end="00:59:32.520" style="s2">just talked about could happen whenever</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.700" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">you&#39;re available okay cuz I could also</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.520" end="00:59:35.880" style="s2">put that out to project B there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:37.260" style="s2">is like there&#39;s already four of us and</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.880" end="00:59:39.059" style="s2">we&#39;re already the four phases that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.260" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">both or when you want to say well the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.059" end="00:59:44.369" style="s2">join like project raising and this right</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">so I can only this channel needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.369" end="00:59:48.599" style="s2">all of like us right just like us so</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:50.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like bringing other people on board</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.599" end="00:59:53.160" style="s2">like this is more of an idea cafe type</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.910" end="00:59:54.630" style="s2">thing of like what are you currently</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.160" end="00:59:56.790" style="s2">doing for food and how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.630" end="00:59:58.020" style="s2">create something that sparks a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.790" end="01:00:00.510" style="s2">conversation where we&#39;re coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.020" end="01:00:02.869" style="s2">a oh cool I want I want to like get in</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.510" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">the realm of possibility and hope</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.869" end="01:00:08.549" style="s2">outside I&#39;m flying within that hour</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:11.240" style="s2">right like hey we actually solved</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.549" end="01:00:13.829" style="s2">something if we had $10,000 or sorry ten</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.240" end="01:00:15.809" style="s2">ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.829" end="01:00:18.329" style="s2">thousand dollars we could make this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.809" end="01:00:20.730" style="s2">then like the channel getting to ten</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.329" end="01:00:22.589" style="s2">thousand it&#39;s not different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.730" end="01:00:24.299" style="s2">difficult but it&#39;s not that difficult if</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.589" end="01:00:25.740" style="s2">it&#39;s an engaging conversation that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.299" end="01:00:27.809" style="s2">people want to watch and participate in</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.740" end="01:00:29.099" style="s2">and then it&#39;s actually possible to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.809" end="01:00:31.950" style="s2">hey do we want to actually make this</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.099" end="01:00:35.849" style="s2">thing you just created the project you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.950" end="01:00:37.140" style="s2">know to me that sounds kind of like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.849" end="01:00:38.790" style="s2">almost makes sense to alternate with</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.140" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">project raising because that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.790" end="01:00:41.970" style="s2">pre project raising that&#39;s like project</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:43.140" style="s2">raising is you have an idea you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.970" end="01:00:45.540" style="s2">what you want to go you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.140" end="01:00:47.579" style="s2">it and you need help and this is like</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.540" end="01:00:50.579" style="s2">your so you know here&#39;s kind of how we</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.579" end="01:00:52.650" style="s2">got to our projects but on a new idea I</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.579" end="01:00:54.299" style="s2">mean the thing with project raising is</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.650" end="01:00:55.619" style="s2">it&#39;s not hard to find people but it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.299" end="01:00:58.950" style="s2">hard to find people to participate</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.619" end="01:01:01.140" style="s2">what like to actually do the raising at</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.950" end="01:01:02.700" style="s2">the project do you have a requirement of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.140" end="01:01:05.369" style="s2">you could participate twice before you</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.700" end="01:01:07.140" style="s2">get your project raised and this could</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.369" end="01:01:09.059" style="s2">be part of the participation right like</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.140" end="01:01:10.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to feel like you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.059" end="01:01:12.470" style="s2">be responsible for cube spawn if it</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.680" end="01:01:14.210" style="s2">fails or don&#39;t I mean like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.470" end="01:01:16.609" style="s2">we&#39;re just figuring out food for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.210" end="01:01:18.619" style="s2">world like just that we&#39;re just thicker</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.609" end="01:01:22.599" style="s2">don&#39;t world peace or just snip all in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.619" end="01:01:28.700" style="s2">here that&#39;s where it is nothing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.599" end="01:01:29.450" style="s2">open to all those options so yep all</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.700" end="01:01:32.030" style="s2">right well I don&#39;t want to wait till</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.450" end="01:01:34.250" style="s2">next week to actually put something out</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.030" end="01:01:36.260" style="s2">there maybe community so are we just</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.250" end="01:01:39.290" style="s2">leaving it with me I&#39;ll either do every</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.260" end="01:01:41.630" style="s2">other week or even this timeslot a new</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.290" end="01:01:45.650" style="s2">time slot or right no not the Friday</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.630" end="01:01:47.630" style="s2">that&#39;s our meta project I mean let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.650" end="01:01:51.580" style="s2">ahead and throw out the general</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.630" end="01:01:56.660" style="s2">problem-solving as to be a future</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.580" end="01:01:58.250" style="s2">project raising slots the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.660" end="01:01:59.660" style="s2">that&#39;s probably creasing or that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.250" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">meta project that would alternate with</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.660" end="01:02:04.849" style="s2">this times log like for the trust</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:06.380" style="s2">conversation for example well I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.849" end="01:02:08.660" style="s2">talking about the trust conversation but</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.380" end="01:02:12.020" style="s2">okay what we&#39;re talking about about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.660" end="01:02:13.700" style="s2">solving problems problem solving like</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.020" end="01:02:16.099" style="s2">the news show which the trust</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.700" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">conversation could be one of but I feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.099" end="01:02:20.510" style="s2">like we actually don&#39;t want to start</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:23.180" style="s2">with the dress conversation was not</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.510" end="01:02:27.410" style="s2">there like solving a problem but that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.180" end="01:02:30.680" style="s2">was the marketing part of projects yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.410" end="01:02:34.040" style="s2">like the meta project but that&#39;s it I</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.680" end="01:02:36.080" style="s2">think it fits with minute yeah that made</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.040" end="01:02:37.790" style="s2">sense because it&#39;s also it&#39;s focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.080" end="01:02:39.560" style="s2">the project but if we&#39;re asking like</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.790" end="01:02:41.900" style="s2">regular everyday people what you trust</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.560" end="01:02:43.760" style="s2">then it&#39;s kind of probably how do we</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.900" end="01:02:46.070" style="s2">solve the problem of trust in politics</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.760" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">how do we solve the problem of my shots</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.070" end="01:02:49.160" style="s2">and then recreating something from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:50.359" style="s2">ground up as opposed to a drill ask and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.160" end="01:02:52.580" style="s2">how do I get you to trust being wiki</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.359" end="01:02:54.859" style="s2">lecture right so it could be like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.580" end="01:02:56.599" style="s2">dress through different right back okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.859" end="01:02:58.010" style="s2">that makes sense so we&#39;re saying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.599" end="01:03:00.320" style="s2">start with it&#39;s sort of just a meta</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.010" end="01:03:01.460" style="s2">project part and what does a project</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.320" end="01:03:03.349" style="s2">need to consider where trust is</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.460" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">concerned in general and then certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.349" end="01:03:07.160" style="s2">projects might have specific challenges</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.960" end="01:03:09.530" style="s2">yeah and so we&#39;re gonna do a project</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.160" end="01:03:11.390" style="s2">raising so this week we have someone</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.530" end="01:03:13.670" style="s2">tomorrow so I said a week from tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.390" end="01:03:16.250" style="s2">we can do this we can do a project</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.670" end="01:03:18.740" style="s2">raising sorry I probably solve a project</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.250" end="01:03:22.520" style="s2">raising around like following this</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.740" end="01:03:25.790" style="s2">format and see how that works like a big</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.520" end="01:03:26.150" style="s2">exclaiming huh sorry could just probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.790" end="01:03:27.859" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.150" end="01:03:29.240" style="s2">a problem raising and a project or</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.859" end="01:03:31.299" style="s2">everything a problem or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.240" end="01:03:33.859" style="s2">that you&#39;re raising it up for a solution</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.299" end="01:03:37.400" style="s2">yes I like it project raising problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.859" end="01:03:39.049" style="s2">project problem project problem that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.400" end="01:03:40.250" style="s2">know we can trial that and see because</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.049" end="01:03:42.349" style="s2">then people can come and participate in</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.250" end="01:03:43.549" style="s2">the rule is to be on in a new project</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.349" end="01:03:46.609" style="s2">reason you have to have come and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.549" end="01:03:49.910" style="s2">participated in at least two problem or</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.609" end="01:03:51.770" style="s2">project raisins is there a problem I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.910" end="01:03:53.809" style="s2">literally talk about any problem if we</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.770" end="01:03:57.380" style="s2">can use technique solutions so is there</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.809" end="01:03:59.420" style="s2">one that resonates with people could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.380" end="01:04:01.430" style="s2">politics you know like I know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.420" end="01:04:03.109" style="s2">very gamey but it also is game be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.430" end="01:04:04.309" style="s2">like how do we trust politicians how do</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.109" end="01:04:07.099" style="s2">we actually create something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.309" end="01:04:08.690" style="s2">Bernie Sanders versus it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.099" end="01:04:10.700" style="s2">matter what country you&#39;re in how do we</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.690" end="01:04:12.140" style="s2">trust how do we create news stories how</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.700" end="01:04:14.569" style="s2">do we like how do we do media coverage</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.140" end="01:04:19.849" style="s2">or do we want nothing to do with your</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.569" end="01:04:25.190" style="s2">projects and focus more on food shelter</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.849" end="01:04:27.619" style="s2">something not have an overlap with my</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.190" end="01:04:30.049" style="s2">current projects on that yeah because I</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.619" end="01:04:31.339" style="s2">think that&#39;ll probably be like when we</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.049" end="01:04:32.900" style="s2">start the coop councils that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.339" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">actually start talking about specific</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.900" end="01:04:36.770" style="s2">like either co-op councils or project</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:39.109" style="s2">rating that that&#39;s the 2d to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.770" end="01:04:41.390" style="s2">like general challenges among that space</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.109" end="01:04:42.950" style="s2">so like politics or you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.390" end="01:04:44.779" style="s2">decision-making and then like</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.950" end="01:04:46.730" style="s2">specifically how does reason score plan</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.779" end="01:04:50.779" style="s2">to solve this certain problem I have an</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.730" end="01:04:53.480" style="s2">idea I&#39;m gonna make a whatever pull and</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.779" end="01:04:55.160" style="s2">post it on the gay people face it will</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.480" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">be three none of them OB politics and</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.160" end="01:04:59.270" style="s2">it&#39;ll be whichever one resonates with</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:00.890" style="s2">the most people will be able under that</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.270" end="01:05:02.990" style="s2">and then we can also post the link to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.890" end="01:05:08.599" style="s2">that video there so the people will</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.990" end="01:05:09.890" style="s2">watch if not participate what all right</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.599" end="01:05:12.049" style="s2">and you notice you don&#39;t come to project</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.890" end="01:05:15.710" style="s2">raises and now problem raises right</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.049" end="01:05:19.460" style="s2">because they&#39;re too early for you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.710" end="01:05:22.549" style="s2">often just too early I might sometimes</p>
