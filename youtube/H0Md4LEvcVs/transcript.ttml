<p begin="00:00:11.440" end="00:00:15.440" style="s2">trying to get that a little more</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">either concrete or nebulous picking one</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.440" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">and then moving on to the next part so</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.000" style="s2">everyone would like to share</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:31.000" style="s2">yes so um i was looking at some example</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.640" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">mission and vision statements um</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.000" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:37.440" style="s2">so uh let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">it&#39;s funny these websites that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.440" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">looking at they don&#39;t have actually have</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">yeah they&#39;d have impaired like nike is</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:44.079" style="s2">the vision is bringing inspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">invert</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.079" end="00:00:47.360" style="s2">and innovation to every athlete in the</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.360" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">and then the mission is create</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">groundbreaking sports innovations</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">make our products sustainably build a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">creative and diverse global team so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">when they are actually listing things</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">out that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">i just started reading a new one and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">it&#39;s different from the others that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">so yeah our you know i i think it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;re getting hung up a bit on</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">terminology and all these terms</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">are a bit vague like mission statement</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">it means different things to different</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">um and in different contexts um</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a very specific thing um</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:29.400" style="s2">and so our uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.439" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">let me just um</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.400" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">give you the wording and i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:36.320" style="s2">y&#39;all could pull up the document i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:37.759" style="s2">going to try and put it on to the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.320" end="00:01:41.119" style="s2">collective document so we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.759" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">move this stuff over to the new version</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.119" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">anyways so i suggesting for the vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">i wanted to take any terminology out</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">that is just internal to the game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">space so like omniwin</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">so my experiment of that was a world</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.000" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">abundant resources are available to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">projects that have long-term benefits</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">for most</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">beings that seems to be a short word</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">the shortest way to say omni when</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">yeah i kind of like that i mean i i i</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">like the idea of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">rid of that either not well understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">or contentious</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">terminology which i think that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">and then in the same way the mission is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">just a rephrasing that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">we facilitate shared resources for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">projects that we have long-term benefits</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:38.800" style="s2">that have long-term benefits to most</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">yeah so and then after five weeks of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">going back and forth and figured it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">i like it</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">well it was just the genesis of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">what everyone was</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">saying so it took it took all of that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">get there</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">um and then so yeah in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">protocol uh love uh foundational</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">document they suggest a couple bullet</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">points which we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">um for the mission uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">but like ray was saying that could</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">probably work um</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">but it might be helpful if we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">do kind of say what is what is the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">that we want to kind of start with uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">and and we do have some shared resources</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">and we started listing them out last</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">meeting so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">um did we actually list them out or did</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">we just talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">i mean we so like i think the the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.000" style="s2">that i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">highlighted down below um sorry like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">selected if you go up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">not like color but just like the text is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">selected yeah there you go that chunk</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">is like to me that was the group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">things that we like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">that those were the resources that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">were kind of talking about that we would</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">be providing</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">and there was some talk about do we want</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">to turn these into sentences or because</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s sub points of a larger sentence</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">is that fine um i think the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">to unders like to have some examples of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing how it&#39;s phrased we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">hash that out but to me that was the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">things that we said that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">providing was the the community so</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">that&#39;s you know the mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">camaraderie that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">um there was the knowledge commons our</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">knowledge base as we&#39;re going and doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">even if this doesn&#39;t go anywhere that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">knowledge can still be there and shared</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">with others uh the shared resources</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">like stream yards and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:34.000" style="s2">like so we don&#39;t have to go out and buy</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">separate things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.000" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">did different people already have it um</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">you know ideally at some point the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">ability to actually fund some projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">you know the community posted their</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">their money together and decides where</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">they want to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">put that towards so</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a slight difference between</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">existing resources and potential future</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">so right now we have we have it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">resources the wrong word is that well i</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">it are they organization resources or</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">are they just directly member resources</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">right like stream yard is my research</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">right no but but that that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">difference between now and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">or organization but we&#39;re only listing</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">the organization ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">right um so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">i don&#39;t i thought we talked about them</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">but i guess we didn&#39;t list them so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">existing resources</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">would be the domain name the things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.560" style="s2">we already have yeah i thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">that was on here that was down um yeah</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">and any current website under there</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.560" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the facebook group and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">i guess we also have a github</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">while no do we we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">organization yet not for taking the tech</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s going to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">weird here is figuring out all those</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">blurred lines where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">uh sort of you know a sibling project</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">has the resource</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">how is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:50.400" style="s2">yeah so maybe you guys are really just</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.639" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">stewarding those assets on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.400" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">a greater community who has yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">determined and you&#39;re creating the space</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">for them to be able to join</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">the stewardship of these assets i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s it for now until you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">more clarity</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">right sure something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">really um that&#39;s what this sets up</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of what you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">co-governance</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">code gov and what protocol dot love</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:15.599" style="s2">specifies is the means to share</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">is how do you steward assets of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.599" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">are the assets are stewarding</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">who has influence over what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">those assets</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">so um generally um it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">primary council will be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">you know in the in the technical</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">specifications for the interfaces i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">be building</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">um when you create a collective there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.759" style="s2">automatically going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">a primary council created and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.759" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">and in order to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">for for individuals to have a say on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">primary council they need to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">influence currency so an influence</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">currency will automatically be created</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">so those kind of things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">kind of just things we can write down</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">and think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">probably already on there in some form</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">depending on which version of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">template you grabbed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">but it&#39;ll be uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">if it&#39;s if we scroll up a little bit um</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">yeah right okay we did some of that cool</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:16.020" style="s2">so the four of you all have 111</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">primary council influence currency um</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.020" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">and how others can obtain is join the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">facebook group keep showing up</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">on facebook friday meetings</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">and then if a current influence currency</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">holder will propose assigning influence</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">currency to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">a member who&#39;s been showing up whenever</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">feels organic</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">and i think the last week we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.519" style="s2">about sort of having two councils</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">where like anybody you know can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.519" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">show up to to these meetings and you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">you know your currency in like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">secondary council</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">or certain decisions would be made by by</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">those councils</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">or by that council and then more more</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">people can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">a part of that and that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">more open one and then there</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">there there need to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">criteria for joining the primary council</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">probably based on how much you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">interacted at the secondary council</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">so you can&#39;t just stockpile currency you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">actually have to interact and vote and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:14.399" style="s2">do things</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">and then at a certain point it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">like hey that person</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">has been really you know contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">the secondary council</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">let&#39;s bring them over cool you could do</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">it like that generally a council is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">uh an entity that&#39;s going to steward a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">set of assets so right</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">um what you might be talking more of uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">in the protocol that love ontology is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">uh equity currency which is just a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">right you&#39;re contributing in some way</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">that we want to recognize so you might</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">just be talking about an equity currency</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">um you know meeting time equity currency</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">or whatever that or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">um so you can write that in there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">you can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">you know assign one one unit for every</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">hour of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">collective meetings somebody shows up</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">for something like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">obviously i&#39;m just making stuff up so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">whatever&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">i i mean that sounds right like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">sounds but i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">the the question that that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">was uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">around like how does somebody actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">join the primary council like do they</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">just show up to the meetings</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">how do they ask right is it just on day</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">one they have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">the you know the the same number of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">well you can be as specific as you want</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">um it says there</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:31.760" style="s2">how others can receive right there right</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">so my point was just the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.760" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">council came out of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">on the like how and when do do we we</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">want to add the currency like is it just</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">you show up and you get one point</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">and then i think that&#39;s when we started</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">to talk about an alternate you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">council that you can just show up and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">get points in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">and that might be where we vote on like</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">you know updates to the website or</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">something like that but like major</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">changes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">you know like do we want to change our</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">our domain name do we want to switch</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">over to using this platform instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">that platform</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">that might be a primary council thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">like sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">the really sweeping changes to assets</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">and then just the smaller like hey what</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">want to do with this what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">think this page on the the website</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.079" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">should look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:18.399" style="s2">that&#39;s more open that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:19.920" style="s2">the thought i had but definitely</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.399" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">interested to hear from julian bentley</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.920" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering what like you were like</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">well this is clearly this this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">clearly that that is not as clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">like i wouldn&#39;t know whether changing</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">the website design</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">is a big one or a small one like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">would mean to be more</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">more put out but i think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">more actually this is primary and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">this is secondary i do like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">there being</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">a type of counsel anyone can show up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">and anyone can be part of but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">yet know whether you&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">primary until you&#39;ve proven that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:52.320" style="s2">here week after week</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">and once that you work well with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.320" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">other primary council members right so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like anyone can be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">secondary if we&#39;re using that language</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:02.959" style="s2">and then um what what does it then look</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">like for us to allow somebody into</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.959" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">primary is it the primary who votes on</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">it it has to be unanimous does it have</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">three quarters like what is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">get that person there do we wait until</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">we have that person to decide it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">because then that&#39;s going to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">more attention than like hey we already</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">said it had to be unanimous and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">one of us said no we&#39;re not gonna tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">you who but one of us said no right but</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">okay when in my interpretation what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">have written here a lot of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:32.160" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">specified um it&#39;s what it&#39;s saying is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.160" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">a a pcic holder a current influencing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">currency holder</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">will propose so that means we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">a proposal and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">proposal can be um positively resolved</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">at which time you would assign the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">currency to the new member</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s all kind of in there because</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">the proposal resolution process we may</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">or may not have already specified they</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">don&#39;t remember it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s down a little further in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">document</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">nope we haven&#39;t so that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">would so so generally so</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">um the proposal would be hey let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">change the website in this way</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">a proposal would be hey let&#39;s buy a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">domain name a proposal would be hey</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">let&#39;s add this person to the primary</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">council these are all just different</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.360" style="s2">proposals</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">that could be made and so how you make</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.360" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">those proposals how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">iterate or discuss those proposals and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">how you resolve those proposals or what</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">you would specify there</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">is probably the the same answer for all</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">those things to keep it simple now if</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">you do want to have two different</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">methodologies for different types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">things then yeah you would want</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">different councils</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">to have two different decision making</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">but it seems to me like you&#39;re you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:45.760" style="s2">pretty easily get away with</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">keeping it simple for now if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">to do and having one decision making</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">methodology for for all those things</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">simple like we&#39;re going to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">simple come on</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">um coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">up which is just that um for the when</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">somebody is on the primary council</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">the way that it&#39;s worded now is like we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">have 111 of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">these currencies and they&#39;re every time</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">they show up they get more and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">know how bentley and adrian feel erratic</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">when he&#39;s here but like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">to me when someone&#39;s part of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">council once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">yes they&#39;re on it they have equal say to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">everybody else and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">right like that is part of having a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">secondary is that you have accrued maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">these points with meeting</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">and then when you&#39;re you voted in yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">you&#39;re an equal member it&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">well you&#39;re a secondary member because</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">you came on a year later and we already</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">had 50 hours of meetings</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">there&#39;s that that piece again yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:42.320" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">just from a definition standpoint when</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.320" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">you say counsel if you mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">what i mean by what protocol.love</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:49.440" style="s2">proposes as to what council means it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">means a group of people that hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.440" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">influence a certain amount of influence</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">currency they make that make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">over a set of assets</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">right so if there&#39;s another set of</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">assets that you want to break out or</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">which is a subset of what you already</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">have listed that you want a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">council to steward</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">then i would say yes start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">a second second council</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">if you&#39;re really just trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">people an acknowledgement</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">for the way they should for showing up</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">to meetings then i think the equity</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">currency would suffice in that instance</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">sorry to cut you off adriel no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">fine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">that that&#39;s helpful um and so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">is if we wanted to go the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">council route</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">what would they be doing like well</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">is it just gagio do you have a reason to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">have a secondary council</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">um i just like do we have secondary</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">assets to manage</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">i&#39;m more thinking about that for like</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">the smaller changes and when we actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">like this is assuming that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">actually start to get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">people involved you know and like people</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">start showing up to five right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">yeah and i would say let&#39;s do that when</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">enough people to worry about it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">let&#39;s not we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">talk about that more now part of that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:15:59.199" style="s2">to build a system to what gets somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">to the primary council</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know part of my goal as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">stepping stone</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">so what what ray is saying is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">don&#39;t use a council to step to a council</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">you use equity currency to step to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">council well he&#39;s saying how councils</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">and currencies are normally used in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">that model which is different from</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">yes so</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">we might want to try to do the decision</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">making methodology before you decide</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">this perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">just so you know what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">about because with the decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">methodology then yeah the proposal can</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:31.679" style="s2">be hey let&#39;s bring on joe</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">to the primary council and give him uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.679" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">10 influence currency</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">or 111 influence currents whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">may be but you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">but you&#39;ll understand what that process</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">would look like then</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">yes so that is further down</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the proposal and that part right</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s right methodology</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">duration yeah so this basically just</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">protocol.love</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">proposes that no matter how you go about</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">making decisions three fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">things always happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">somebody initiates a proposal there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">one there are zero or more iterations on</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">that proposal that is discussions or</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">changes to it and then at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">resolve it by saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">okay let&#39;s get into action now or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">table this we&#39;re not going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">so how do you go about doing those</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">things and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">goal here is not to invent some perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">governance methodology</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">um the goal is to keep it simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">if that&#39;s possible for now um to just</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">recognize what you&#39;ve been doing write</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">it down</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">and then if you want to change it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">have a framework within which to change</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">because a proposal can be change the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">proposal initiation methodology</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">so it seems like if i had to guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">showing up on these meetings doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">having a verbal discussion and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">going yep that sounds good to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">is kind of how it goes so basically the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">initiation is attend a board reading and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">bring up a new</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">topic i guess and present your proposal</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">yep like something like proposals are</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">made um</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">on live video conferences</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">and then you might want to specify</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">somebody mentioned quorum like how many</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">people need to be present right</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">um do we want quorum 4</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.880" style="s2">initiation or just for resolution like</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">if we think that something is you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.880" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">if i&#39;m gone one week and you know anne</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">radick isn&#39;t here so it&#39;s just julian</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">bentley</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">julie has an idea and her and bentley</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">talk about it for 10 or 15 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">say cool let&#39;s bring that up next time</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">it can still be</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">initiated possibly even iterated just</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">not voting on it and probably won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">the final iteration but i think those</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">first two don&#39;t need quorum</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">but again interested to hear what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">done yeah since everything&#39;s recorded</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">that should be fine also true</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:58.400" style="s2">um do you think it&#39;s good to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">call out the areas where there is no</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.400" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">quorum</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">just to be explicit</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">you mean like what we can&#39;t do unless</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">there&#39;s like just you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">attend board meeting and present</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">proposal to group and audience</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">no minimum quorum needed right or no</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">quorum levels at here or or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s clear or or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">quorum is two i was gonna say yeah i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">just show up</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">and like propose all my all my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">oh yeah i mean you could just record the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.400" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">video and you primarily watch it later</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:42.640" style="s2">i yeah i i would just say for you know</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">for now they have to be primary council</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">members in order for it to count</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">as like but really you know if jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:56.080" style="s2">shows up and</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.360" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">about then it ends up being fine too</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s a good point right</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">because that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">any two people having a conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">already quorum even if it&#39;s not fridays</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">and that is part of it is yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to anyone outside of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve done as a family</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">uh so iteration um i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">really needs to be here like it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">well i i i guess like practice omega</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">rule is probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">thing here i&#39;m not sure if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">put that in there but like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">some element or is that just a general</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">rule for the primary council</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">just everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think we need to get that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">little detail that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">be our common way of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">that&#39;s also more than continue</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">without your face it&#39;s harder to know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">i was going to say that for iterations i</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">know i could iterate till the cows come</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">um that that&#39;s not actually helpful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.679" style="s2">like hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">here&#39;s the initiation and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">iteration</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">is like not just can you come up with</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">something different</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">is there something that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">equally as good that you can iterate</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">right is this an improvement</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:44.799" style="s2">or is it just are you just saying things</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">yeah or based on how we are as humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.799" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.480" style="s2">what we do so far it could also be that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">we need that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.480" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">right we need 10 15 minutes to go over</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">any iteration</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">let&#39;s get a unicorn let&#39;s get a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">and then um</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.080" style="s2">are we back here&#39;s the original one</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">where anything that came out of that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.080" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">secondary iteration or you know however</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:06.720" style="s2">many we</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">we need to be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.720" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">i&#39;m good with either having that</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:12.240" style="s2">brainstorm is part of our normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">and then sometimes it could be like well</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.240" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense to have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">brainstorm for this one</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense okay i guess</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">another part of this that&#39;s tied to sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">of the first thing is where does this</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">like i we kind of do meeting minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">not really</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">i wonder if we&#39;ve like kind of started</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">doing them properly on like okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">the minutes for this date</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">you know jubilees you know submitted the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">proposal for x</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">as a part or sorry she initiated the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">proposal for x</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">here&#39;s that part of the the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">and then to keep it easy we just keep</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">everything in the the minutes</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">at some point you probably want like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">separate place where the proposals live</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">you can say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">this proposal that julie made here&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:53.600" style="s2">being initiated here&#39;s iteration one two</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.039" end="00:23:54.880" style="s2">and three</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.600" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">here&#39;s the final iteration and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">how the vote went can you guys hear me</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">yep okay good all right i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">talk earlier i don&#39;t think he could</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">all right so a couple things here</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">obviously people just having</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">conversations anytime</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">uh in their lives uh isn&#39;t a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">but what happens is that that same</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">conversation is had</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">in the meeting on the zoom call what</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">you&#39;re calling a board meeting which you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">might want to just define exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">um then that is a proposal and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">um yeah so to your point adriel</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">definitely what a lot of groups have</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">um is they just there&#39;s no documentation</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">required for the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no documentation required for</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:32.559" style="s2">the iteration but on the resolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">you go and do your best to recruit to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.559" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">reconstruct when it was initiated by who</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">what iterations were there any</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">dissenting sorry sorry to interrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">raymond are you aware your camera is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">still on</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">we can hear you we&#39;re all so quiet</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">i&#39;m just putting a belt on there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">nothing weird it&#39;s all good i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:48.799" style="s2">know if you knew that was all</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">i was like does this supposed to get a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.799" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">little more or less keep going keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">going sorry to interrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">yeah all right cool um so yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s what a lot of groups do</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:03.120" style="s2">you just document it all on resolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">and then you can just have a google doc</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.120" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">that you can even link to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">right in your resolutions methodology</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">section you can point right to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">google doc</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s one way to do it okay um</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">i like that as sort of like the the bare</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">bones no matter what we have to have it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">documented when</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">we&#39;re resolving it because then where</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">does it go otherwise hey didn&#39;t we talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">changing something two weeks ago what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">what do we do to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">doing about that um i am wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.000" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem like these meetings i</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">mean especially me</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.720" style="s2">are terribly organized so i wondered if</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">the if we did want to say like</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.720" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">ideally if you want to have a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">so we can sort of see like how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">changed and you know who proposed it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">how old it is and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">um if we want to start out with just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">basic like one proposal document and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">then you know if we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">proposal in a meeting we do a screen</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">share like this where it&#39;s kind of meant</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">to like take notes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">as i do find that doing something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">this where we actually have a document</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">that we&#39;re all working off of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">keeps things on track way better when</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">we&#39;re like okay so this sentence here</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">you know is what we just come up with</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">okay well what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">you know by board meeting or what do you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">mean by this and you can start to sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">work it out and then at the end we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">got notes of what we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">because there have been quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">meetings where we come back what were we</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">talking about last time</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">we talked about something like this or</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">was that two two sessions ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">i feel like what might work for us i</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to put it in here</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">is um where we did have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">was even called like what we were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:38.960" style="s2">talk about right and we pulled it up</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">every time we never had it on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.960" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">right having something like that that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">um like sort of first draft start with</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">an agenda and have that turn into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">kind of like meaning sorry whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">have the same thing we had before</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">it&#39;s chaotic it&#39;s messy we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">necessarily keep it up but when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">resolve something we have kind of a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">version that that is what we absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">do so even if the other one falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">and the other one</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.919" style="s2">you know what i mean we don&#39;t we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">talking about omni when the definition</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">for three day for three sessions</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">when we resolve something that goes on</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">and possibly even a spreadsheet for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">those initiations of proposals of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">every proposal initiated and just where</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">it stands right did we resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">did we did we table it like what</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">happened um because that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">resolution right there ones that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">like well i don&#39;t know did we end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">finishing that sentence did we</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">actually talk about that right like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:33.200" style="s2">rough copy</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">and then like the because i i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.200" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">we can keep one good document and put on</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">resolutions i think we can manage</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s different and the nice thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">about that is because it&#39;s a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">and for doing it with a google doc</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:46.720" style="s2">you can then have have also links like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">if you have a different</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.720" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">document per resolution or you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">or sorry per</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">proposal or maybe only when it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">resolution either way</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">once it has a document you can stick it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">in that sheet you can see here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">the proposal here&#39;s where it&#39;s at here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">when it was done there&#39;s no document yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">oh there is no great stick it in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">spreadsheet and then that&#39;s the one list</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.559" style="s2">how&#39;s that i like it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how that fits into this</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">spot</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">i almost wonder if we need</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to document the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.799" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">initiation the iterations but what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">really going to document is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">is what i think we can write down like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:28.240" style="s2">good copy resolution where you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">follow through what happened on this</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.240" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">meeting what happened on this meeting</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">a here&#39;s where our marketing proposal</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">stands or here&#39;s where our</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">um now i guess part of the question is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">vote on a resolution that fails and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">we&#39;re like look you know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">stop talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">we probably don&#39;t need a full resolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">document i guess it&#39;s just if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">saying yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">or is it also if we&#39;re saying no that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">feel like we still want to go and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">if properly a resolution i feel it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">resolution it&#39;s either we voted yes we</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">voted no</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">or we voted to table it because it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">too much conflict but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">reiterate it we&#39;re going to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">x amount or we&#39;re not going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">to it it was two it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">too difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">yeah i can recommend some wording for</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">you if you want sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:24.799" style="s2">yeah it sounds like on a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">initiation you just</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.799" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">say proposals are initiated</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">when at least two</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">pcic holders are present</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">sorry proposals are initiated when at</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">least two pcic holders are present in</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">interactive video meetings</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m so this is under initiation</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">methodology right yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">um so proposals are initiated when</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">yeah like that those are initiated when</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.000" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">at least two pcic members are present in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">an interactive video meeting and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">gives us quorum as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">right you can use the quorum if you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">no that&#39;s fine i like to stick to things</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">possible and then i think i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">the same for an iteration proposals are</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">iterated when it&#39;s two pc i</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">see two pcic holders are present in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">interactive video meeting</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">and then a resolution you just say</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">uh proposals are resolved when at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">or what are you doing you&#39;ll be doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">back in census</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">yeah what are we doing for actual like</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">to pass something how much</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">does it have to pass by</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">i guess we probably want to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">percentages i&#39;m guessing so like as</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">things grow</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">so if yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">we could always change it later right</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">now we could say consensus meaning</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">there has to be no dissenters right i</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">how do you normally phrase that right um</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">well yeah if you want consensus then</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">when uh proposals are</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">uh positively resolved when 100 percent</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">of pcic holders</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">or 100 percent of pcic</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">desires it so</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">okay and then uh i always try</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">i never use the word vote but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">just me okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">uh then you know upon positive</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">all details of the initiation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">iterations are recorded</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">along with the details of the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">of you know something like that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">details of the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:40.840" style="s2">when it was initiated by who what it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">iterated by who</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.840" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:49.360" style="s2">and that should pretty much do it that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">you know you could like i said you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.360" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">actually create a blank</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">uh google doc right now and link to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">right in there doc</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">right here in this resolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">methodology section</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">um and for the resolution i i i i guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">we said all bcsc holders so that is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">quorum is everyone full resolutions i</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">guess we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">yeah we should probably like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">who&#39;s present</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">everyone who like that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">like like right now radix</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">here right so are we we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">we don&#39;t do anything because he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">here how does that actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">yeah i i guess that that&#39;s true oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">that&#39;s wording it so that yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">couldn&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">it&#39;s yes super choppy but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s saying all pcic holders</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s not saying all them present it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">saying all of them so there&#39;s two pieces</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">everyone present can vote and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">they&#39;re the people who aren&#39;t present</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">have an option to initiate a proposal to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">undo it right to be like hey</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">iteration resolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">like you&#39;re we&#39;re all fully allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">make decisions without everybody present</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">but if we have those those quora members</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.679" style="s2">someone can come in and be</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a red card in consensus</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.679" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">like you don&#39;t come in and do that for</p>

<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">consensus one person saying hey i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">like what you guys decided this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">big enough i would have read flagged</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">this</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">that but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">come to a conclusion until it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">part of the meeting right</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">okay so we can initiate it and we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">iterate it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">we just as long as there&#39;s at least two</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">but then to actually resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">we have to have quorum of at least 75</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">percent of the pci see holders present</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">and of those people there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">consensus</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">75 present and it has to be during this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">friday meeting right or if we move the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:56.960" style="s2">friday meeting it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">at an official meeting as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.960" end="00:35:59.760" style="s2">whatever for now i&#39;m just i&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">to try to word it properly i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.760" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">going to say quorum is now do want 75</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">or 66 yeah just as the two sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">standard</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">if if you just say 75 have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s an assumption when you say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s a quorum</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m saying you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">duplicating language to say they have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">be proven</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">different from they can&#39;t agree if</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">they&#39;re not there they totally</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">disagree right like quorum is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">even vote at all so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">right there are different terms but by</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">saying that that they have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">they have to be there to agree so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">have to have that as a quorum</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">so what i&#39;m saying is a quorum for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">discussion but a vote it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">percentage of votes</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">they have to be there to vote so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have to say both</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">right but we&#39;re talking about changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">one of them right if we&#39;re saying only</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">75</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">of the people have to be present like in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">that meeting for us to vote on it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">do those all have to agree because then</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">that&#39;s two different things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">saying there&#39;s no reason to say those</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">two different</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">i&#39;m just saying it&#39;s over complicating</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">it to say anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">let&#39;s not say how many people have to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">there or quorum just say how many people</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">seventy-five percent after are you</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">saying if someone&#39;s present and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">disagree even though you have 75 percent</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">then it won&#39;t happen that&#39;s why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">trying to express that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.640" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">saying so far is like</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">if anybody votes there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">consensus among those who vote and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:29.680" style="s2">the quorum is</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">yeah are we going to bother if only two</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.680" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">out of 10 people are voted we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:37.200" style="s2">if it&#39;s 100 of them because it&#39;s only 20</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">of the total council</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">our decision-making methodology still</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">need to call out</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">and quorum is 75 so we can&#39;t really even</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">resolve</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">anything if there aren&#39;t at least 75 of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">us 75</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">of us present but then we are having a</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">to get to consensus we do have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">resolution what happens when we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:37:59.680" style="s2">come to consensus</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">right and that will be well yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.680" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">well red car</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">green card yellow card are we leaving</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">because there&#39;s a conflict like</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">what does that look like against this</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">right and i know radick had said at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">end of the last time right that that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.560" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">his like no i want to come to consensus</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing so far</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s a little bit of like when we</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:26.240" style="s2">first come to our first conflict</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">that what then happens right then it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.240" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">partly a resolution of what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">we can&#39;t come to a consensus on an idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s different than quorum quorums</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">just how many people need to be present</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">for us to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">come to a consensus at all yeah for us</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">to even try</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">right right i&#39;m just right right just</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">ignore what i said because that was i</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">realize that someone could be present</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">and and and disagree with it and then it</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">won&#39;t pass</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">even if you have the 75 percent right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">you know i hadn&#39;t thought about how</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">consensus works that way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">right right so yeah 75 quorum and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">consensus of the people present</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">okay i would i would recommend not using</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">the word quorum because if you do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">need to define what that means but just</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">say it so um</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">75 of the people present yeah i guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">yeah members pcs holders yeah whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.359" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">then uh but what i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">suggesting in that first</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">wording we used was i said uh 100 of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">pcic holders</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">desire to be so um so that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">require them to be present on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:42.880" style="s2">meeting that means like you could all</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">agree on the meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.880" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">and uh uh it was the other fella who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">not there</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">uh you could say hey i&#39;ll check with him</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">offline and if he says</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">yeah then i&#39;ll record that and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">mention i&#39;ll put that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">mention that i did that and well well</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">yeah what we don&#39;t want is if someone</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">falls off the face of the earth and just</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">leaves the project</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:04.079" style="s2">we we don&#39;t want to have to be held up</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">by them yeah which is likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.079" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">in an open project like this especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">as the numbers grow right if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.640" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">accounts of 10 people</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">that can get out of control pretty fast</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">yep and so then you could have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">exception for that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">uh if if a member is unreachable</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">we&#39;ll do xyz and then assume that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">approve</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">right yeah yeah so that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">we have except we&#39;re putting the onus on</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">them to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">to attend the meeting yeah and then if</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">it went on a super long time we might</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">have a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">to remove them that they will have to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">present for but we all have to agree</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">so you know if jubilee disappears for</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">two months and we&#39;re starting to talk</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:48.880" style="s2">but you know i know that she&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">something i don&#39;t agree then like</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.880" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be if we all agreed like</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">yeah she&#39;s been gone she&#39;s been m.i.a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">see you later then she&#39;d be removed</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">just like for any of us um</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">okay so you&#39;d be in the same 22 with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">proposal to remove somebody&#39;s pcic</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s 100 consensus so it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">the simplest thing might be to leave</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">kind of something like that a rich</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">wording but just have an exception that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">if if a board member is unreachable</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:21.119" style="s2">is unable to be communicated with then</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do these this procedure</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.119" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">and if none of that works then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:25.680" style="s2">temporarily remove their pcic or</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.680" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">right well i i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">the wording we have gets at the same</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.520" style="s2">yeah i think we would then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:39.520" style="s2">introduce whatever</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.520" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">we wanted as a proposal in these these</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.520" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">situations so right now we&#39;ve got at</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">least 75 percent of pcic</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">holders uh must be present to hold a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">vote and there must be</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">consensus uh let&#39;s say to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">resolve it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">this is another reason i don&#39;t use the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">word vote</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:01.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s just really to me like to</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">really boil it down</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.680" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">you just want approval from x number of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">people or approval from</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:12.319" style="s2">x amount of pcic okay uh so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">you receive google from everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.319" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">that means if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want it to go fast</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">so what do we call the the session that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">that happens like usually you&#39;d say to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">hold a vote</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">to ask for approval</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">if you hold a vote then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">define all the things about what that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">you can it just like again</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying i disagree i&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">can it just become</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:42.839" style="s2">a consensus at least 75 percent of pcic</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">holders must be present to come to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.839" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">consensus sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">what two positive results is that what</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:54.000" style="s2">you mean come to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">consensus on a resolution so at least 75</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.000" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">percent of pcic holders must be present</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">to come to a consensus on resolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">okay so you have to say there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">expressing dissent</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">i think because that kind of implies you</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">could have 75 percent people agree and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">but if we want to explicitly say if</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">someone truly agrees it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s implied no you don&#39;t want no</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">dissenting opinions you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">imply</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">something like this you want to explicit</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">so yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">um with no dissenting opinions would</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">probably do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s part yeah okay but this part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:32.079" style="s2">consensus is like whatever our consensus</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:34.160" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">is it should be obvious whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.160" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">somebody&#39;s in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">whether they&#39;re like in between like uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">i would but i&#39;m gonna let you guys go</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">um versus for it right and that is kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.280" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.359" style="s2">like you&#39;re not voting you&#39;re green</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">carding red carding whatever our thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">and red card is like you&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">not in consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">leaving over it right and yellow so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting right i see so i</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">mean it sounds a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.359" style="s2">sort of yellow is abstaining red is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.359" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">although i guess yellow is also a soft</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">no it&#39;s just like i don&#39;t want it but i</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">don&#39;t care that much so if you go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not going to be i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">using the the terminology</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">when i was doing this i like that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">idea right because not all nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">what&#39;s that what&#39;s all the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">rag flag</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">but while we were doing it it was like</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s making that obvious</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:30.480" style="s2">the word i was thinking of was block</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">block yeah that&#39;s the red card is block</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.480" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">in that yeah so no one blocks the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">resolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s not because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">leaving and staying you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not terminology for what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">doing it&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">it&#39;s allowing or blocking</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">holders blocking okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">you guys could write all that out right</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">but you wanted all that well i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">think we want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">yeah i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">get in that level of detail just as long</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">as we know what word</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">means someone&#39;s expressly</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">yeah i think as long as i people is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">blocking so i think that&#39;s clear right</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">and as long as we&#39;re setting up this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">initial system to support</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">you know a system where we can make</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">whatever changes we we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">we need as long as you know we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">to some form of a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">i that&#39;s good so you know i i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">anyone here thinks that this is perfect</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">but it gives us the roadmap to say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">i have these changes i want to make so i</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">can make proposals and go through it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">we can have that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">discussion on how to change this and of</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">course we haven&#39;t signed anything yet so</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">if next week you say actually i came up</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">with a better idea then we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:44.880" style="s2">but for now i think that this works as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">good model for</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.880" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s also four of us we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">need cards when there&#39;s four of us</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">it&#39;s more when there&#39;s you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like we don&#39;t want to be like</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">adrenal how do you feel bentley how do</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">you feel it&#39;s like you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">show the cards um it just makes it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">easier however</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">yes here we&#39;re going to be talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to know who&#39;s blocking your</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:04.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel comfortable with this yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">we still need to deal with this and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.319" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll come to a point when when</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">no resolution still a resolution and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">still have to come to something right</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">i think that that that makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">then odds are</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably end up with some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">like a backlog of like proposals that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">some people like some people didn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">we might want to massage them in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">future but for now we&#39;ll drop it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.559" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">yeah so it sounds like you can keep it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">really simple</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">in your resolution process</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">so let me actually move this part up</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.839" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">because if like if you just say that</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">everybody has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">copy yeah i see</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:48:00.559" style="s2">get there right but the bottom agreed</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.200" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">can anyone else cut out a bunch it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">just me</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">yeah couldn&#39;t quite hear you but yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">where i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">we&#39;re good with what it&#39;s at at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">okay so here i</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">i guess we can go through it all because</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">it&#39;s fairly short so the initiation</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">methodology is proposals are initiated</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">when at least two pcic holders are</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">in an interactive video meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">iteration methodology</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">uh proposals are iterated when at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">two pcic holders are present in an</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">interactive video meeting the resolution</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">at least 75 percent of pcic holders must</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">be present</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">to come to a consensus on a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">with no holders blocking</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">upon positive resolution all details of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:51.040" style="s2">initiation and iterations are recorded</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">details should include who initiated the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">proposal the iterations and participated</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:04.960" style="s2">in the resolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">that sounds good uh my question is um</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.960" end="00:49:07.040" style="s2">what do we mean by interactive video</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">recorded so other people can watch it</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">right it might be private it might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">unlisted and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">you might be like i feel like a recorded</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">video meeting</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">recorded meeting even if it&#39;s not made</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">we know we have it right like it would</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">make no sense for adriel and bentley to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">have a conversation that&#39;s private</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:04.960" style="s2">where they talked about initiation</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">iteration resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">and reddick and i can&#39;t see it right</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">like at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">that maybe that might be the case like</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">later on i think also</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">the interactive video meeting is only</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">mentioned in initiation and iteration</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">right like so and so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">meant to be vague</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">so that it&#39;s like if we you know do the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">project round table and something comes</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">up there</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">we can still initiate it and iterate it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:32.880" style="s2">there but to actually vote on it or like</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">to actually have the resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.880" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">we have to bring that to the board</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">meeting um</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">so i wonder if in the resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">methodology we want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">mention the board meeting is like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">happens there um</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">and or change the wording on interactive</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">video meetings so that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">you know it could just be recorded</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">theoretically it could just be audio</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">if push comes to shove it could be me</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">over jubilee&#39;s place</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">yeah no that&#39;s kind of right sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">you just have a conversation carrie and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:04.480" style="s2">i have conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">she&#39;s i don&#39;t know if she&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.480" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">together tech anymore but like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">right it just kind of comes up and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.599" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">sometimes we record sometimes we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh yeah that wasn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">which i guess then</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">if we&#39;re just saying like can you</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">initiate something</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">at not a board meeting or does it have</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.160" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">to be initiated like</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">you can have all the pre-initiation</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">conversations you want and pre-planning</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">and do this and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">go to town but when you&#39;re like hey guys</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.680" style="s2">i have an idea for</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">together tech could that happen at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.680" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">project round table or you know just me</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">over at jubilee&#39;s place or does that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">have to happen here think we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">it can happen just with you over at my</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">place because we could do the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">but like it&#39;s not going to get resolved</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">until we&#39;re again bringing it to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">median and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">and everyone else hasn&#39;t has an option</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:49.200" style="s2">of iterating it right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">an option of it so it&#39;s like yes they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.200" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">be at the board meeting but with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">understanding that it could have come</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">from somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">and there&#39;s a three-hour conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">you weren&#39;t privy to or we did dish</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">out but that doesn&#39;t mean that we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">decide on things from that three-hour</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:02.800" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:04.319" style="s2">right that whatever was there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.800" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">brought into</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.319" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">into the conversation to be resolved a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">like because if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">billy and i went up to the side and had</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">a bunch of meetings and planned out some</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">cool stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">like in my mind that&#39;s not initiation</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">yet we&#39;re sort of pre-initiation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">planning hey</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">for us to initiate this proposal for</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">together tech let&#39;s you know get all our</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">ducks in a row and and make some images</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">explaining things and some mock-ups or</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">whatever else we end up saying is</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">now in our minds we might be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">okay we&#39;re going to show it to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:37.760" style="s2">the council everyone is going to agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.760" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">but we still have to go through like</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">actually initiating it with the council</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">and then they might have some iterations</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">it almost seems like if you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">it in front of the council</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">you may think you&#39;re doing a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">vote but technically</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">you&#39;re initiating it you might end up</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">passing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">more often than not there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">still going to be iterations at that</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:02.079" style="s2">at that point they should probably be</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">done through the council right like if</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.079" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">if bentley and i go off and plan and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">come and show stuff to the council</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">and then jubilee and radic are like well</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">actually let&#39;s change this and do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.920" style="s2">and do this and and do that instead</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">to me that sounds like the real</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.920" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">initiation and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:20.559" style="s2">the that&#39;s the first also iteration</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">where we&#39;re saying we&#39;re initiating it</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.559" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">and then jubilee and radic are saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">well wait hold on this this this now</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the first iteration all in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">same meeting</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re very right it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">let&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">rough draft versus a good draft right if</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">we have a conversation there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">going to be initiations and iterations</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">coming up</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:39.200" style="s2">but we&#39;re not going to officially</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">initiate and iterate it until we come to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.200" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">the council and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">the resolutions the piece you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">bring but in order to bring the</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">resolution you have to bring the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">just we&#39;re kind of honoring that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">this is still</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">like you can still have the initiation</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">and iteration and initiation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">reiteration all day every day but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:57.040" style="s2">until it&#39;s officially parted together</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:58.319" style="s2">tech you&#39;re gonna have to bring it to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.040" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">meeting we&#39;re gonna have to iterate it</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">anyway and we&#39;re gonna resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">right i guess i&#39;m just wondering do we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:06.480" style="s2">care about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">the initiating and iterating outside of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.480" end="00:54:08.720" style="s2">that because i&#39;ve got a ton of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">i might end up proposing that i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">initiating and iterating by myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">right and just like going off and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">planning things in my mind that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">really count as</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">initiation it&#39;s me just right right</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">a planning ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">initiation or iteration it&#39;s just here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">how you could</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">one of the one of your members of your</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">council or ultimately anybody outside</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">if you want to operate with complete</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">transparency here&#39;s how you</p>
